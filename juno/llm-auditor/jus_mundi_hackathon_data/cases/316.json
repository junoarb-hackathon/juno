Factual and Procedural Background**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present order deals with a Request for Provisional Measures (the \"Request\") filed by the Republic of Indonesia (the \"Respondent\") on 22 November 2012, by which the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\na. Order the Claimant to refrain from making false, unfounded and misleading statements in the media regarding the case at hand; and\n\nb. Order the Claimant to refrain from approaching and/or persuading and/or inducing any officials [of] the Government of the Republic of Indonesia [to enter into] any \"amicable\" settlement outside the present arbitration proceedings.1\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, pp. 7-8.\n\n2.\n\nIn its Reply to Claimant\u2019s Response to Request for Provisional Measures (the \"Reply\"), which was dispatched to the Tribunal on 7 January 2013, the Respondent reiterated its request for the same measures to be ordered by the Tribunal.2\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, p. 10.\n\n3.\n\nChurchill Mining PLC (the \"Claimant\") has objected to the Request and has asked the Tribunal to:\n\na. Reject the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures; and\n\nb. Direct the Respondent to pay all the Claimant\u2019s costs and expenses of responding to this Request.3\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 32; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 24.\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute giving rise to this arbitration originates from the alleged revocation on 4 May 2010 of four mining licenses by the Respondent. After various unsuccessful attempts to settle the dispute, the Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Centre for Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\" or \"ICSID\") on 22 May 2012.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Request, the Respondent asked for two distinct orders. Regarding the first order, the Respondent claims that the Claimant has uttered in the press on various occasions false statements that could antagonize potential investors and jeopardize the Respondent\u2019s \"right to welcome foreign investors to invest in its territory\".4 In connection with the second order requested, the Respondent claims that it has a right to be free from pressure in handling the present dispute and asks the Tribunal to recommend that the Claimant \"refrain from approaching and/or persuading and/or inducing any officials of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to settle this dispute outside the present arbitration proceedings\".5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 17.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal held its first session on 27 November 2012 by video link. During that session, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the briefing schedule for the Request which was later reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 as follows:\n\n(1) The Claimant shall file a Response to the Request for Provisional Measures by 17 December 2012;\n\n(2) The Respondent shall file a Reply by 7 January 2013; and\n\n(3) The Claimant shall file a Rejoinder by 21 January 2013.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with this schedule, on 17 December 2012, the Claimant filed its Response to the Request. On 7 January 2013, the Respondent filed its Reply and on 21 January 2013, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n**II. Position of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Position of the Respondent\n-----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nIn its Request, the Respondent starts by indicating that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant the Tribunal the authority to recommend provisional measures, with or without the consent of the parties, if the Tribunal deems it necessary to preserve either party\u2019s rights.6\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 1.\n\n9.\n\nWith respect to the order requested, the Respondent asserts that the \"Claimant must be estopped from making false, unfounded, and misleading statements to the media\".7 According to the Respondent, Churchill Mining PLC consistently made false publications through several media agencies with regard to the facts that form the basis of the present proceedings.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 4.\n\n10.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has consistently tried to convey the impression that it was the owner of shares in the Ridlatama Companies,8 notwithstanding the fact that the Ridlatama Companies are disputing this allegation. The Respondent cites as example an excerpt of an article published by Reuters on 12 April 2012.9 According to the Respondent, \"the Claimant took a vigorous act in the media in its effort to gain a public opinion that it had indeed *(quod non)* purchased and became the legitimate owner of a portion of shares in Ridlatama Companies\".10\n\nThe Ridlatama Companies are comprised of PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (\"PT RTP\"), PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (\"PT RTM\"), PT Investmine Nusa Persada (\"PT INP\"), and PT Investama Resources (\"PT IR\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 5, Excerpt No. 1; **Exh. R-RPM-1**.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 8.\n\n11.\n\nSecond, the Respondent complains that on various occasions the Claimant has made statements in the press that may create the impression that the investment climate in Indonesia is deteriorating. The Respondent cites six excerpts from press releases, in which the chairman of Churchill Mining PLC, Mr. David Quinlivan, is quoted making statements which \"may jeopardize the Respondent\u2019s right to foreign investment\".\n\n12.\n\nAs a first example, the Respondent quotes an excerpt from the Reuters publication of 12 April 2012 referred to above, in which Mr. Quinlivan states that the ICSID case is directed against the Republic of Indonesia \"which allowed our licenses to be revoked in what we say is an unfair and improper manner\".11 In its second example, the Respondent cites another excerpt from the same press release where Mr. Quinlivan expresses the opinion that \"[w]hat\u2019s happened to Churchill would be akin to somebody in the UK coming along and taking the title-deeds to all the houses that all the Indonesians have invested in London\".12 In the third excerpt, from the same Reuters publication, Mr. Quinlivan advises foreign investors to \"tread very carefully\" when investing in Indonesia, and indicates that he would \"probably say no\" to investing there \"given recent developments\".13\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 9, Excerpt No. 2; **Exh. R-RPM-1**.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 9, Excerpt No. 3; **Exh. R-RPM-1**.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 9, Excerpt No. 4; **Exh. R-RPM-1**.\n\n13.\n\nAs a fourth example, the Respondent refers to a press release published by Stockmarketwire.com on 23 May 2012, in which Mr. Quinlivan asserts that \"[a]t all levels there seems to be a lack of support from Indonesia with regard to our contentions\".14 In its fifth example, the Respondent relies on a press release from Minesite.com published on 15 June 2012, which quotes Mr. Quinlivan saying that \"[a]s long as you are spending money and finding nothing, the attitude is very good [...] but, once you find something, well-connected people decide they want a share\".15 Finally, the Respondent mentions an article published on 6 June 2012 in the New York Times, which quotes Mr. Quinlivan asserting that the \"Indonesian business people have seen the huge amount of money foreign owners of mining projects have made and stand to make in the future, and they\u2019d like to take it away from them\".16\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 9, Excerpt No. 5; **Exh. R-RPM-3**.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 9, Excerpt No. 6, **Exh. R-RPM-4**.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 9, Excerpt No. 7, **Exh. R-RPM-5**.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fact that such statements have been made through international media agencies \"only exacerbates\" the Respondent\u2019s situation because prospective foreign investors could be unduly influenced by such statements. Besides qualifying such statements as \"a mere expression of angst\", the Respondent claims that such false statements go beyond stating facts \"all the way to condemning the Republic of Indonesia\".17\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 10.\n\n15.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that it has a \"right to welcome foreign investors to invest in its territory\", and that such press statements could \"jeopardize the Respondent\u2019s right to foreign investment\" and thus potentially severely impact its economy.18\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 13.\n\n16.\n\nFor all these reasons, Indonesia asks the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures \"prohibiting the Claimant to make any further false, unfounded and misleading statement to the media\".19\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 14.\n\n17.\n\nWith respect to the second order which it seeks, the Respondent complains of the Claimant\u2019s attempts to approach government officials in order to settle the present dispute. It explains that these attempts have \"caused a lot of disturbances to the authorized representatives of the Respondent\" due to pressures coming from fellow officials that have been approached by the Claimant.20\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 15.\n\n18.\n\nBecause it considers that it has a right to handle this case in an orderly manner free from any external pressure,21 the Respondent asks the Tribunal \"to render a procedural recommendation for the Claimant to refrain from approaching and/or persuading and/or inducing any officials of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to settle this dispute outside the present arbitration proceedings\".22\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 17.\n\n19.\n\nIn its Reply to the Claimant\u2019s Response, the Respondent starts by noting that, although the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not specify which rights deserve protection by way of provisional measures, the objective of such measures is to (i) preserve the parties\u2019 rights; (ii) prevent self-help; and (iii) keep the peace as a general matter.23 By engaging in \"false, unfounded and misleading campaigns\" and approaching officials of the Indonesian government in order to exert pressure to settle the dispute outside of the present proceedings, the Claimant engages - so the Respondent says - in self-help which justifies the provisional measures sought by the Respondent.24\n\nReply, \u00b6 4.\n\nReply, \u00b6 7.\n\n20.\n\nRegarding the first order sought, the Respondent reiterates that the Claimant has made \"false, unfounded and misleading statements\" in the press, and cites an article published on 1 November 2012 in the Wall Street Journal,25 which allegedly confirms the Respondent\u2019s fears that such statements jeopardize the Respondent\u2019s \"rights to regulate and promote investments in its natural resources, and to enforce regulations on investments in its natural resources\".26\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The Wall Street Journal article is entitled \"Clouds Gather Over Indonesia - Investors Fear That Contract Disputes, Nationalism Will Curb Access to Natural Resources\", 1 November 2012, Wall Street Journal, Business & Finance Section, p. 17; **Exh. R-RPM-7**.\n\nReply, \u00b6 6.\n\n21.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent repeats that the Claimant cannot be the holder of mining licenses, because such licenses can only be held by Indonesian nationals.27 It also rebuts the accusation that its actions represent \"a wholesale, blatant land grab\" as could be read in some press releases.28\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n22.\n\nFinally, Indonesia asserts that these false, unfounded and misleading statements \"are harmful and the damages caused by them are irreparable\".29\n\nReply, \u00b6 24.\n\n23.\n\nRegarding the second order sought, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has sent copies of its Request for Arbitration to eight officials. It also informs that Mr. Quinlivan has publicly stated that \"[t]he lobbying will continue\", which the Respondent qualifies as the \"classic strategy of *divide et impera*\".30 On that basis, the Respondent claims that \"out-of-court\" settlement proposals should exclusively be addressed to the authorized representative of the Respondent, i.e., the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, and that the Claimant should refrain from contacting other agencies of the government in order to seek an amicable outcome of this dispute.\n\nReply, \u00b6 27.\n\n2. Position of the Claimant\n---------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn its Response, the Claimant agrees that the Tribunal has the power to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. However, relying on *Maffezini,*31 the Claimant states first that such measures have only been recommended by ICSID tribunals in exceptional circumstances.32 The Claimant further submits that the burden rests on the party requesting provisional measures to demonstrate that the conditions of urgency and necessity are fulfilled. In the opinion of the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to discharge such burden.33 Finally, the Claimant asserts that provisional measures can only be recommended to preserve the rights of the parties to a dispute, and that the Respondent has failed to identify the rights in need of protection.34\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Meffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/17), Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 October 1999, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 6.\n\n25.\n\nWith regard to the first order sought, the Claimant argues that none of its statements are false, unfounded or misleading. In any event, the provisional measure stage is not the appropriate juncture to decide on such matters, which should be dealt with during the jurisdictional or merits phase.35 Relying on *Amco v. Indonesia*36 and *World Duty Free v. Kenya*,37 the Claimant also argues that, in general, parties are entitled to discuss proceedings in public.38 The Claimant also cites *EDF v. Romania,*39 in support of the absence of a confidentiality duty in the ICSID framework.40\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 9.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1) (hereinafter \"Amco v. Indonesia\"), Decision on Request for Provisional Measures of 9 December 1983, p. 412.\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v. Kenya* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7), Award of 4 October 2006, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 12.\n\n*EDF (Services) Ltd v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Procedural Order No. 2 of 30 May 2008, \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 13.\n\n26.\n\nWith respect to the statements about which the Respondent complains, the Claimant states that none of them have transgressed \"the bounds of appropriate comment in ICSID proceedings\".41 It calls the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that the Respondent has also made public statements concerning the present proceedings which include \"unfounded allegations\" concerning Churchill's conduct.42\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 18.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 19, with a list of six public statements of Indonesian officials alluding to the present proceedings.\n\n27.\n\nFinally, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has identified no rights capable of protection through provisional measures, and has failed to substantiate any necessity and urgency.43\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 24.\n\n28.\n\nWith regard to the second order sought, the Claimant argues first that the Respondent has again failed to identify any rights that may be the subject of provisional measures.44 Second, it contends that nothing prevents disputing parties to seek an amicable settlement even after the initiation of arbitration proceedings. Although Article 26 of the ICSID Convention excludes other remedies, it does not affect the possibility of reaching an amicable settlement.45\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 29.\n\n29.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Claimant repeats that the Respondent has failed to identify rights in need of protection and such rights must be those in dispute to deserve protection through provisional remedies.46 Relying on *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,*47 the Claimant argues that the rights for which the Respondent seeks protection, i.e. the right to regulate and promote investments in its natural resources and the right to enforce regulations on investments in natural resources, \"are not rights which might be the object of a recommendation for provisional measures\".48\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 4.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24) (hereinafter \"Plama v. Bulgaria\"), Order on Provisional Measures of 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 5.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the proposition that by making statements in press articles or by seeking an out-of-court settlement it may be engaging in self-help.49\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 8.\n\n31.\n\nRegarding the first order sought, the Claimant reaffirms its position according to which \"it is permissible for a party in ICSID proceedings to state its case in public in general terms\",50 and there is no press campaign on the part of the Claimant which might warrant a recommendation for provisional measures.51 Churchill also reiterates that the Respondent has failed to identify the necessity and urgency that would justify recommending provisional measures.52\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b614.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 17, and in respect of the second order sought, \u00b6 23.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, the Claimant notes that Mr. Quinlivan\u2019s statement, which was quoted by the Respondent in its Reply and according to which \"[t]he lobbying will continue\", pre-dates the institution of proceedings.53 It adds that the Respondent has failed to identify the author of other statements, thus hindering it to respond to such unsubstantiated assertions. In any case, such statements would not justify the recommendation of provisional measures.54\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 21.\n\n**III. Analysis**\n-----------------\n\n1. Legal Framework\n------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe relevant rules regarding the power of the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures are to be found in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules (2006).\n\n34.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n35.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in relevant parts:\n\n(1) At any time during the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n[...]\n\n2. *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to recommend provisional measures prior to ruling on its jurisdiction. However, the Tribunal will not exercise such power unless it has *prima facie* jurisdiction. The Tribunal will therefore assess whether there is a *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae, ratione temporis,* and *ratione voluntatis.*\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent is a signatory to the ICSID Convention. The Claimant claims to be a United Kingdom national, and the United Kingdom is also a signatory to the ICSID Convention. Thus, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the present dispute arises from breaches by the Respondent of its obligations under the UK-Indonesia BIT. The Tribunal is aware that, in its answers to the Request for Arbitration dated 11 June 2012 and 14 June 2012, the Respondent submitted that there was no dispute arising directly out of an investment. In light of the fact that it is the Respondent who presented the Request and that the Respondent argues therein that it has a right to seek an orderly resolution of the dispute in the framework of this arbitration, the Tribunal finds that for present purposes it has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\n\n39.\n\nFurther, the Claimant alleges in its Request for Arbitration that the dispute arose in May 2010, long after the entry into force of the UK-Indonesia BIT in 1977. The Respondent has not contested this allegation so far. Thus, the Tribunal finds that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\n\n40.\n\nFinally, at least at first sight, by ratifying the UK-Indonesia BIT, the Respondent consented in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre over disputes such as those submitted by the Claimant. For its part, the Claimant consented in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre by filing its Request for Arbitration. Accordingly, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*.\n\n41.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction for purposes of issuing this order. It adds that this finding in no way preempts its later decision on jurisdiction.\n\n3. Requirements for Provisional Measures\n----------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThere seems to be no disagreement between the Parties on the requirements for provisional measures. According to Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the request must specify \"the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures\". Various ICSID tribunals have interpreted these requirements to mean that provisional measures must (i) serve to protect certain rights of the applicant, (ii) meet the requirement of urgency; and (iii) the requirement of necessity, which implies the existence of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm.55\n\nSee *Plama v. Bulgaria,* Order on Provisional Measures of 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38 ; *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures of 29 June 2009, \u00b6 51 ; *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/02), Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, \u00b6 113 ; *Iona Micula and others v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20), Decision on Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures of 2 March 2011, \u00b6 12.\n\n43.\n\nBy contrast, the Parties disagree on the type and existence of the rights to be protected. They also disagree on whether the measures are urgent and necessary.\n\na. Existence of Rights Requiring Preservation\n---------------------------------------------\n\ni. First order sought\n---------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the following rights need preservation by way of provisional measures: (i) the right to welcome foreign investors to invest in its territory, i.e. the Respondent\u2019s right to host foreign investments;56 (ii) the right to regulate and promote investments in its natural resources;57 (iii) the right to enforce regulations on investments in its natural resources;58 (iv) the right to the protection of the law against attacks upon its honor and reputation;59 and (v) the right to justice based on factual truth.60\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 23.\n\n45.\n\nFor its part, the Claimant denies that the right to foreign investment deserves protection by way of provisional measures because \"[i]t is not a right in dispute, nor a right relating to the procedural integrity of the proceedings\".61 It also asserts that the Respondent has failed to identify rights that may be the subject of provisional measures, as \"[a]ny provisional measure must relate to rights which are in dispute in the proceedings\".62 Relying on *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* the Claimant stresses that the rights that may find protection by way of provisional measures are essentially defined by the claims. This said, it acknowledges that Indonesia may also seek protection for procedural rights in order to maintain the integrity of the arbitration proceedings.63\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 5.\n\n46.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribunal notes that the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules contain no general rule imposing a duty of confidentiality on the parties and prohibiting them from disclosing their case in public, as was already stated 30 years ago in *Amco v. Indonesia*.64 At the same time, it is true that the parties are bound by a good faith duty not to exacerbate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n*Amco v. Indonesia,* Decision on Request for Provisional Measures of 9 December 1983, p. 412.\n\n47.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, public statements uttered by a party to ICSID proceedings could violate this duty of good faith. However, the Tribunal sees no indication of such a violation in the present case. The fact that one party states in public that it contests the claims of another does not in and of itself warrant the recommendation of provisional measures, and the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that it is permissible for a party in ICSID proceedings to state its case in public in general terms.65\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 14.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal further agrees with the Claimant\u2019s position in that the rights to be preserved need to bear a relation with the dispute. As stated by the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* :\n\nThe rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party\u2019s ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be carried out. Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party\u2019s claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those general rights must be related to the specific disputes in arbitration, which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant\u2019s claims and requests for relief to date.66\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* Order of 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40.\n\n49.\n\nIn *Amco v. Indonesia*, where the arbitral tribunal was faced with a request for provisional measures concerning a similar scenario, Indonesia complained of various newspaper articles that it deemed prejudicial as they could potentially have a negative impact on its economy. While the tribunal acknowledged that public statements by a foreign investor could potentially have a negative effect on the economy of a host State, the tribunal found that no right in dispute was at stake. The arbitral tribunal held as follows:\n\nIt might possibly be that a large press campaign could have such an influence. However, even so, it would not be an influence on rights in dispute.67\n\nThe Tribunal fails to see how the rights alleged by the Respondent requiring preservation are related to the dispute at hand, or could be jeopardized by the controversial statements.\n\n*Amco v. Indonesia,* Decision on Request for Provisional Measures of 9 December 1983, p. 411.\n\n50.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s understanding, the rights invoked by the Respondent, i.e. the right to attract foreign investment, the right to regulate and promote foreign investment in its natural resources, the right to enforce the regulations on investments in its natural resources, the right to the protection of its honor and reputation, and the right to justice based on factual truth, are not rights in dispute that could warrant the recommendation of provisional measures. While the Tribunal has full respect for the Respondent\u2019s right to promote foreign investment in its natural resources and its sovereign right to regulate such activities on its territory in accordance with its international law obligations, it is of the opinion that none of the public statements made by the Claimant reach a level that could jeopardize the Respondent\u2019s rights in dispute.\n\nii. Second order sought\n-----------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent claims that its right to be free from any pressure in handling the present case needs preservation by way of provisional measures.68 In contrast, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has failed to substantiate its allegations that the Claimant has pressured various government officials to engage in settlement negotiations and that it carries the burden of proof.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, \u00b6 16.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note that, in support of its request, the Respondent has only mentioned the statement by Mr. Quinlivan that the \"lobbying will continue\", which predates the initiation of the present proceedings. The Respondent has also referred to the fact that the Request for Arbitration was dispatched to eight different government agencies. These allegations are insufficient to constitute proof of any wrongful conduct.\n\n53.\n\nOn a more general note, the Tribunal stresses that parties to arbitration proceedings are free to engage in settlement negotiations. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides that consent given to the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal is \"deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy\", applies to parallel judicial or arbitral proceedings, not to negotiations.\n\n54.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has failed to identify any right that may justify provisional measures.\n\nb. Urgency\n----------\n\n55.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal also notes that the Respondent has made no representation regarding the urgency.\n\nc. Necessity\n------------\n\n56.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal notes that Indonesia has made insufficient representations regarding the risk of irreparable or serious damage.\n\nd. Final Observations\n---------------------\n\n57.\n\nWhile the request for provisional measures must be denied, the Tribunal reminds the Parties of their general duty, which arises from the principle of good faith, not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration.\n\n**IV. Order**\n-------------\n\n58.\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal issues the following order:\n\n(1) The provisional measures sought by the Respondent are denied;\n\n(2) Costs are reserved for a later decision or award."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction (Planet Mining Pty Ltd)", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2014-02-24T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction (Planet Mining Pty Ltd)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| AIM | Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty, specifically, without further designation, the Australia-Indonesia BIT |\n| BKPM | Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board |\n| BPK | Financial Auditor Body (*Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan*) |\n| Claimant | Planet Mining Pty Ltd |\n| Claimants | Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd |\n| C-PHB1 | Claimant's first Post-Hearing Brief of 23 August 2013 |\n| C-PHB2 | Claimant's second Post-Hearing Brief of 30 August 2013 |\n| C-RFA | Churchill Mining Plc's Request for Arbitration of 22 May 2012 in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 |\n| EKCP | East Kutai Coal Project |\n| ER1 | First Expert Report |\n| ER2 | Second Expert Report |\n| Exh.

THE CLAIMANT**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Planet Mining Pty Ltd, a proprietary limited company incorporated in Australia on 19 August 2005 (\"Planet\" or the \"Claimant\"). It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Churchill Mining Plc, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales (\"Churchill\"). Planet provides mining services, including general survey services, exploration and exploitation of mining sites.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Stephen Jagusch, Anthony Sinclair, Alex Gerbi, Epaminontas Triantafilou, Ms. Bridie Balderstone, and Mr. Benjamin Burnham of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP, and by Messrs. Fred Bennett, David Orta, and Tai-Heng Cheng of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Indonesia (\"Indonesia\" or the \"Respondent\"; and together with Planet, the \"Parties\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Amir Syamsudin, Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Coordinator of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Didi Dermawan, Legal Representative of the Regent of East Kutai and the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Cahyo R. Muzhar, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Supporting Legal Team Member of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, Supporting Legal Team Member of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Dr. Freddy Harris, Secretary of Team Churchill Mining Case, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Richele S. Suwita, Ms. Marcia S. Tanudjaja, and Ms. Dwi Deila Wulandari Taslim of DNC Advocates at Work.\n\n**II. THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n5.\n\nThis section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to Indonesia's objections to jurisdiction. Unless otherwise stated, the facts are undisputed.\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the present arbitration was consolidated with ICSID arbitration ARB/12/14 initiated by Churchill. It was left open whether the Tribunal would render one or two decisions on jurisdiction or awards. The Tribunal has decided to issue two separate decisions (see below \u00b6 83). The facts and the procedural history are largely identical in both cases.\n\n**A. THE EAST KUTAI COAL PROJECT**\n----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe East Kutai Coal Project (the \"EKCP\") is a mining project developed by the Claimant jointly with various Indonesian companies in the Regency of East Kutai on the island of Kalimantan in Indonesia. According to various sources, the area encompassing the EKCP hosts the seventh largest coal deposit on the planet and the second largest coal deposit in Indonesia.1 The Claimant asserts that through surveys conducted over several years, it has confirmed the existence of approximately 2.7 billion metric tons of coal in the EKCP area.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.\n\n8.\n\nThe coal found there is classified as high-quality sub-bituminous coal with very low sulphur and ash content.2 According to the Claimant, this high-quality coal is ideally suited for the new generation power stations which have been developed lately in countries like India and China and are also in high demand in Europe because of their reduced environmental impact.3\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 9, 124.\n\nMem., \u00b6 124.\n\n9.\n\nRelying on a Feasibility Study modeling an evaluation of the EKCP for an initial 25-year period,4 the Claimant indicates that the project has a pre-tax net present value of approximately USD 1.8 billion and pre-tax cash flows in excess of USD 500 million per year over the first 20 years of capacity production.\n\nChurchill Mining Plc East Kutai Coal Project Feasibility Study, September 2010 (**Exh. C-250**).\n\n10.\n\nOn 10 March 2005, the Regent of East Kutai issued three so-called KP Exploration Licenses to PT Nusantara Wahau Coal (\"PT NWC\"),5 PT Kaltim Nusantara Coal (\"PT KNC\"),6 and PT Batubara Nusantara Kaltim (\"PT BNK\")7 (together the \"Nusantara companies\") over areas that coincide with the future EKCP.\n\nExploration Business License for Nusantara Wahau Coal, Decision No. 80/02,188.45/HK/III/2005 dated 10 March 2005 (**Exh.

THE 2005 BKPM APPROVAL OF PT INDONESIA COAL DEVELOPMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 November 2005, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (\"BKPM\") delivered an authorization to PT Indonesian Coal Development (\"PT ICD\") to be incorporated as an Indonesian foreign direct-investment company (a so-called \"PMA\") and to conduct business in the mining sector in Indonesia (the \"2005 BKPM Approval\").8 PT ICD was initially created by Profit Point Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi, an Indonesian citizen and co-founder of the Ridlatama group.9 The authorized capital of PT ICD is Rupiah (\"Rp.\") 2,512,500,000, divided into 250,000 shares, with a nominal value of Rp. 10,050 per share.10 Profit Point Group Ltd acquired 237,500 shares and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi 12,500 shares.11\n\nForeign Capital Investment Approval for PT ICD, Decision No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (with Certificate of Translation) (**Exh. C-17**) ; BKPM Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (**Exh. R-003**), both dated 23 November 2005.\n\n*Id.,* Section I.\n\n*Id.*, Section VII.\n\n*Id.*, Section VII(4).\n\n12.\n\nAccording to the 2005 BKPM Approval, PT ICD could engage in general mining supporting services, *i.e.*, \"consultancy in relation to business planning for construction of building and other facilities in the domain of general mining projects\".12\n\n*Id.*, Section III.\n\n13.\n\nSection IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains a dispute settlement clause making reference to ICSID arbitration in the following terms:\n\n\"In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia is prepared/ready to follow settlement according to provisions of the convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign Citizen regarding investment in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968\".13\n\n*Id*., Section IX(4).\n\n14.\n\nOn 28 December 2005, PT ICD's articles of association received approval from the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights.14\n\nDecree of the Minister of Justice and Human Rights No. C-34768 HT.01.01.TH.2005 to approve the Establishment Deed of PT ICD dated 28 December 2005 (**Exh. C-19**).\n\n**C. CHURCHILL AND PLANET'S ACQUISITION OF SHARES IN PT ICD AND THE 2006 BKPM APPROVAL**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn 2006, an Indonesian group of companies, the Ridlatama group, introduced the EKCP to Churchill and Planet, who decided to invest in the project because they considered it promising. As a first step, Churchill and Planet entered into discussions with Ridlatama about acquiring PT ICD.\n\n16.\n\nOn 24 April 2006, Churchill and Planet acquired the shares in PT ICD from the initial shareholders, Profit Point Group Ltd and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi.15 Churchill acquired a 95% stake in PT ICD, while Planet acquired the remaining 5%. On 8 May 2006, the BKPM approved the change in PT ICD's shareholding (the \"2006 BKPM Approval\").16\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 62-66; RMOJ, \u00b6 50.\n\nApproval of Changes in Participation Within the Company's Capital for PT ICD, Decision No. 578/III/PMA/2006 dated 8 May 2006 (**Exh.

P-26**).\n\n19.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, PT ICD was to report on the change in its shareholding to the Minister of Law and Human Rights. This was done, again according to Indonesia, on 8 April 2008.\n\n**D. THE RIDLATAMA GROUP AND THE 2007 KP GENERAL SURVEY BUSINESS LICENSES**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Ridlatama group consists of seven companies incorporated in Indonesia and owned or controlled by four Indonesian individuals: Messrs. Andreas Rinaldi and Anang Mudjiantoro, and their wives, Mmes. Ani Setiawan Rinaldi (\"Setiawan\") and Florita.19 The seven companies are (1) PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (\"PT RTM\"), (2) PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (\"PT RTP\"), (3) PT Ridlatama Steel (\"PT RS\"), (4) PT Ridlatama Power (\"PT RP\"), (5) PT Investama Resources (\"PT IR\"), (6) PT Investama Nusa Persada (\"PR INP\"), and (7) PT Techno Coal Utama Prima (\"PT TCUP\") (together the \"Ridlatama companies\").\n\nMem., \u00b6 59.\n\n21.\n\nOf the seven Ridlatama companies, the first six successively obtained mining licenses for the area covering the EKCP. PT TCUP was initially established on 21 November 2006, being authorized to engage in geological and mining services.\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 February 2007, PT RS and PT RP were granted by the Regent of East Kutai (the \"Regent\"), and in accordance with 1967 Mining Law,20 two General Survey Business Licenses in two blocks of the EKCP area,21 covering an area of approximately 400 square kilometers situated approximately 110 kilometers northwest of Sangatta.22 According to Planet, the licenses lapsed in 2008 and the two companies became dormant because no sufficient coal deposits were found.23 In any event, these two concessions did not overlap with any of the Nusantara concession areas (which according to Planet had expired in March 2006), so no dispute arose between the Parties over these two concessions.24\n\nLaw No. 11/1967 on the Basic Provisions of Mining (**Exh.

On 30 March 2010, PT TCUP obtained the BKPM Approval to operate as a PMA company, *i.e.*, to have foreign shareholders.60 On 16 April 2010, PT TCUP amended its Articles of Association to increase its authorized capital and issue new shares.61 On 15 June 2010, PT TCUP obtained the approval for this amendment by the Minister of Law and Human Rights.62 Following this approval, PT TCUP increased its shares, and PT ICD acquired direct ownership of 99.01% of the shares, while Churchill acquired on 25 November 2010 the remaining 0.99% of PT TCUP's shares, making Churchill the 100% ultimate owner of PT TCUP.63\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 1 57, 350; Benjamin WS, \u00b6 79.

Their dispute is brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\") and the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 17 November 1992 (the \"Australia-Indonesia BIT\", the \"Treaty\", or the \"BIT\").84 A parallel ICSID arbitration was initiated by Churchill, a British mining company, against Indonesia essentially regarding the same set of facts. That dispute is brought under the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 27 April 1976 (the \"UK-Indonesia BIT\"). Eventually, the parties to these two proceedings agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations (see below \u00b6 59).\n\nAgreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"Australia-Indonesia BIT\") (**Exh. PLA-1** ; **Exh. CLA-19** ; **Exh. R-002**). The BIT entered into force on 29 July 1993.\n\n49.\n\nFor purposes of clarity, the present section will first address the initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 by Planet, followed by a brief outline of the initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 by Churchill, and then conclude with the procedural steps involved in the decision to consolidate both cases.\n\n**1. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, Planet sent a Notification of Dispute to the Republic of Indonesia.85 Therein, Planet proposed to Indonesia to agree (i) that the Tribunal appointed in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 between Churchill and Indonesia also resolve the dispute submitted by Planet, and (ii) that both disputes be resolved in consolidated proceedings. The notification letter remained without response.86\n\n**Exh. P-74**.\n\nP-RFA, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 50.\n\n51.\n\nOn 26 November 2012, Planet filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Australia-Indonesia BIT. Planet invoked breaches of Articles II(2), II(3), IV and IV of the BIT and claimed financial compensation to be specified in due course.87\n\nP-RFA, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34.\n\n52.\n\nPlanet also reiterated its proposal that the Tribunal constituted in the arbitration initiated by Churchill resolve the present dispute and that the proceedings be consolidated.88\n\nP-RFA, \u00b6 51.\n\n53.\n\nOn 26 December 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Planet's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On 8 January 2013, Indonesia informed the Centre that it agreed to Planet's proposal that Churchill's and Planet's claims be heard by the same Tribunal. On 11 January 2013, the Centre took note of the Parties' confirmations of their agreement on the constitution of the Tribunal, *i.e.*, that the Tribunal was to be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and shall consist of Professor Albert van den Berg, a Dutch national, Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a Singaporean national, and Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as the President of the Tribunal. On 22 January 2013, the Secretary-General of the Centre informed the Parties that Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, had accepted their appointments as arbitrators and the Tribunal had been duly constituted in Case No. ARB/12/40. On the same date, the Centre designated Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**2. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, Churchill filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the UK-Indonesia BIT. On 22 June 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Churchill's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On 14 September 2012, Indonesia requested that the Arbitral Tribunal in that case be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 19 September 2012, Professor van den Berg accepted his appointment as the Claimant-appointed arbitrator, followed by Mr. Michael Hwang's acceptance as the Respondent-appointed arbitrator on 21 September 2012 and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's acceptance as President of the Tribunal on 3 October 2012. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) and the proceedings commenced on 3 October 2012. On the same date, the Centre designated Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as Secretary of the Tribunal. After having obtained the agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal informed the Parties through its Secretary by letter of 5 February 2013 that the appointment of Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer as Assistant to the Tribunal had become effective.\n\n55.\n\nOn 27 November 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held the first session by video link. On 6 December 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing the schedule of submissions for the jurisdictional phase. It was decided that a hearing on jurisdiction would take place in Singapore on 13 May 2013, May 14 being kept as a reserve day.\n\n56.\n\nOn 5 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 denying a petition by the Government of the Regency of East Kutai to be joined to the proceedings. On 22 November 2012, Indonesia filed a Request for Provisional Measures and a Document Production Request in connection with jurisdiction. On 4 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 denying the provisional measures sought by Indonesia.\n\n57.\n\nWith respect to the Document Production Request, Churchill undertook to produce the requested documents with its first memorial. Having heard the Parties, the Tribunal ordered Churchill to produce the requested documents together with an explanatory note by 17 December 2012, which Churchill did.\n\n58.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, Churchill submitted to the Tribunal an amended Request for Arbitration seeking to add PT Indonesia Coal Development (PT ICD) as a claimant in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14. On 4 March 2013, the Tribunal denied Churchill's request to join PT ICD to the proceedings.\n\n**3. Consolidation**\n--------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties in ICSID Cases No. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40 held a common session by video link on 1 March 2013, which was sound and video recorded. Besides serving as the first session in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 pursuant to Rule 13 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the common session addressed consolidation. Having secured the agreement in principle of the Parties that the two disputes be heard in a consolidated case,89 the Tribunal heard the Parties on the modalities of consolidation. The Tribunal noted that the Parties agreed to join the two proceedings in all respects, but disagreed on whether the Tribunal should render one joint decision/award in respect of both Churchill and Planet or two separate decisions/awards, one in respect of each claimant.\n\n*See, inter alia*, Planet's letter of 4 October 2012; Churchill's letter of 12 October 2012; and Indonesia's letter of 4 January 2013.\n\n60.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the content of the common session. With regard to the modalities of the consolidated proceedings, it decided that the procedural calendar under Annex 3 to Procedural Order No. 1, amended by letter of 21 February 2013 and supplemented by letter of 1 March 2013, would govern; that the Tribunal's orders issued as of the date of the common session would apply to all three Parties, with the exception of Procedural Order No. 3 dealing with Indonesia's request for provisional measures in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14; that the Centre would maintain only one case account; and that Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer would serve as Assistant to the Tribunal in the consolidated proceedings.\n\n61.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal noted that it would decide whether to render one or two decisions/awards at a later stage, after consultation with the involved parties.\n\n**B. WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn paragraph 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by the Tribunal's letter of 21 February 2013, and recorded in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal set the following schedule for the jurisdictional phase:\n\n(i) Churchill and Planet would file their Memorial by 13 March 2013;\n\n(ii) the Respondent would file its Objections to Jurisdiction by 8 April 2013;\n\n(iii) Churchill and Planet would file their Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction by 30 April 2013; and\n\n(iv) the Respondent would file a Reply to the Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction by 6 May 2013.\n\n63.\n\nDuring the common session of 1 March 2013, the Respondent stated that it intended to make additional document requests in connection with jurisdiction. After having heard the views of Churchill and Planet, the Tribunal established the following schedule for document production in a letter of 1 March 2013, confirmed in Procedural Order No. 4:\n\n(i) the Respondent would file its Request by 6 March 2013;\n\n(ii) Churchill and Planet would state their Response to the Request and any objections thereto by 11 March 2013;\n\n(iii) the Respondent would respond to the aforementioned objections, if any, by 14 March 2013;\n\n(iv) the Tribunal would rule on the objections, if any, by 19 March 2013; and\n\n(v) Churchill and Planet would produce those documents for which no objection has been sustained by the Tribunal by 22 March 2013.\n\n64.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 ruling on the objections to the document production request submitted by Churchill and Planet. By letter of 22 March 2013, Churchill and Planet informed the Tribunal that they had sent hard copies of all responsive documents in their possession at that time, and that they would adhere to the continuing obligation under Procedural Order No. 5 to produce any outstanding final awards or decisions, as specified in that Order, as soon as they become available.\n\n65.\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Churchill and Planet filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits, enclosing 348 exhibits and 69 legal exhibits.\n\n66.\n\nOn 8 April 2013, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing 101 exhibits and 77 legal exhibits.\n\n67.\n\nOn 30 April 2013, Churchill and Planet filed their Reply to Indonesia's Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing 12 exhibits and 70 legal exhibits. The Reply was also accompanied by the Second Expert Report of the Claimants' expert on Indonesian law, Dr. Nono A. Makarim.\n\n68.\n\nOn 6 May 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing 9 exhibits and 28 legal exhibits.\n\n69.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone conference in order to discuss outstanding matters related to the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction. The telephone conference was audio-recorded. On the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 containing the schedule of the hearing.\n\n**C. HEARING ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nOn 13-14 May 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Singapore. In attendance at the hearing were the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, ICSID Legal Counsel Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, the Assistant to the Tribunal, and the following party representatives:\n\n(i) On behalf of Planet\n\n\u2022 Mr. Stephen Jagusch, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Anthony Sinclair, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Epaminontas Triantafilou, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP\n\n\u2022 Ms. Bridie Balderstone, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Nicholas Smith, Churchill Mining Plc\n\n\u2022 Ms. Fara Luwia, Churchill Minig Plc\n\n(ii) On behalf of the Respondent\n\n\u2022 Mr. Dr. Amir Syamsudin, Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia - Coordinator of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia\n\n\u2022 Mr. Didi Dermawan, Legal Representative of the Regent of East Kutai and the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia\n\n\u2022 Mr. Cahyo R.

Stephen Jagusch, Anthony Sinclair and Epaminontas Triantafilou presented oral arguments on behalf of Planet; Mr. Didi Dermawan and Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson presented oral arguments on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n72.\n\nDuring the morning session of the hearing on 13 May 2013, the Parties made short opening statements, followed by the examination of Planet's expert witness on Indonesian law, Dr. Nono Makarim. In the afternoon, the Respondent then presented its first round of oral arguments. During the morning session of the hearing on 14 May 2013, Planet presented its first round of oral arguments. In the afternoon, each Party, starting with the Respondent, presented its second round of oral arguments.\n\n73.\n\nThe hearing was sound recorded. A *verbatim* transcript was subsequently distributed to the Parties.\n\n**D. POST-HEARING PHASE**\n-------------------------\n\n74.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 confirming that there would be no post-hearing briefs, that corrections to the hearing transcript were due by 29 May 2013, that the Tribunal would decide on any disagreement between the Parties in this respect, and that each Party was to submit its statement of costs by 5 June 2013, allowing the other Party to comment by 12 June 2013. The Parties submitted their agreed revisions to the hearing transcript on 29 May 2013.\n\n75.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal identified several matters requiring further submissions. On 22 July 2013, the Tribunal sent to the Parties a series of questions, inviting them to respond simultaneously by 12 August 2013, and to comment, again simultaneously, by 16 August 2013. On the Claimant's request, the Tribunal postponed these dates and the Parties filed their submissions on 23 and 30 August 2013. Planet (and Churchill) enclosed 6 exhibits and 26 legal exhibits to its first submission and 3 legal exhibits to its second submission. Indonesia enclosed 5 exhibits and 3 legal exhibits to its first submission and 1 exhibit and 18 legal exhibits to its second submission.\n\n76.\n\nHaving deliberated, the Tribunal renders the present decision on jurisdiction.90 The Tribunal will first summarize the positions of the Parties (Section IV), then analyze these positions (Section V), and finally set out its decision (Section VI).\n\nThe Tribunal uses the term \"jurisdiction\" as referring to \"the jurisdiction of the Centre\" and \"the competence of the Tribunal\" (see Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n**IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn its submissions, Indonesia raised the following objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal with regard to Planet:\n\n(i) The Respondent has not provided its consent in writing to submit the disputes encompassed in the Requests for Arbitration to ICSID;\n\n(ii) Planet's alleged investments do not fall within the scope of investments protected under the Australia-Indonesia BIT, because (i) Planet violated the terms of the investment approvals by engaging in activities not contemplated in the approvals, including using PT ICD as an investment vehicle; (ii) Planet, in complete disregard of Indonesian laws prohibiting PMA companies such as PT ICD to own shares or any interest in KP Holders such as the Ridlatama Companies, entered into beneficial ownership arrangements in order to circumvent that limitation thereby violating Article 1320 of the Civil Code and Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law.91\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 135.\n\n78.\n\nOn the basis of these arguments, Indonesia invites the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and\n\n(ii) order Planet to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent.92\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant put forward the following main arguments:\n\n(i) Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration under the Australia-Indonesia BIT;\n\n(ii) in any event, the requirement of consent under the Australia-Indonesia BIT is fulfilled by way of the BKPM Approvals granted to PT ICD;\n\n(iii) the investment has been admitted in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.\n\n80.\n\nOn the basis of these contentions, Planet requests the Tribunal to:\n\n1) Reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Indonesia; and\n\n2) Declare that it has jurisdiction under the Australia-Indonesia BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n3) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment; and\n\n4) Award any other relief the Tribunal deems just and appropriate.93\n\nReply, \u00b6 200.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address certain preliminary matters (A) before it enters into the analysis of the jurisdictional objections (B and C).\n\n**A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. One or two decisions/awards?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nAt the common session during which consolidation of the proceedings before the Tribunal was agreed, the Respondent indicated a preference for a single decision/award, while Churchill and Planet asked for two separate decisions/awards. The issue was left open and Procedural Order No. 4, issued after the common session, states that the Tribunal will resolve it.94 At the hearing, the Tribunal again requested the Parties' views.95 The Respondent reiterated its preference for a single decision/award, and stated that \"Planet is controlled by Churchill Mining and the claims are the same, so the fact that there are two different bilateral investment treaties is really irrelevant for us. So we would like the tribunal just to render one award or one decision on jurisdiction\".96 Churchill and Planet, for their part, maintained their prior position by stating that \"the earlier position we articulated was that we encouraged the efficiencies to be gained by having single hearings in respect of the two cases and that we sought separate awards, and that remains our position\".97\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6 1.3.4.\n\nTr. 14052013, 126:3-22.\n\nTr. 14052013, 155:7-12.\n\nTr. 14052013, 166:6-10.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that it must respect the modalities of consolidation agreed by the Parties. The Parties have agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations for all purposes including the conduct of the proceedings and the case account, with the exception of the decisions/awards. Absent consent in this latter respect, the Tribunal considers that it lacks the power to issue a joint decision or award. Hence, the Tribunal will render two separate rulings, the present one concerning ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40.\n\n**2. The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn support of their positions, the Parties relied on previous ICSID decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions.98 At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it deems that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It further deems that, subject to the specific provisions of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.\n\nIn its Reply, \u00b6 173, the Claimant indicates that \"investor-state jurisprudence, which constitutes nonbinding but persuasive authority [constitutes] therefore appropriate \u2018supplementary means of interpretation' under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention\". The Respondent also indicated that it is for the Tribunal to make its own assessment of the authorities submitted by the Parties, *see* Tr. 13052013, 139:22-140:16.\n\n**3. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the ICSID Convention on the one hand, and of the Australia-Indonesia BIT,99 on the other hand. In addition, where an international law instrument refers to jurisdictional requirements governed by the municipal law of a Contracting State, that municipal law shall also govern the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to the extent provided by the BIT.\n\n**Exh. PLA-1**; **Exh. CLA-19**; **Exh. R-002**.\n\n3.1 Jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n88.\n\nAccordingly, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides for four requirements for jurisdiction. There must be (i) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State,100 (ii) of a legal nature, (iii) arising directly from an investment,101 and (iv) the Parties must have consented in writing to arbitration.\n\nMem., \u00b6 312; Reply, \u00b6 5; Tr. 13052013, 8:10-11.\n\nMem., \u00b6 313; Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\n89.\n\nThere is no dispute on the first three requirements and rightly so. Indeed, the Tribunal is satisfied that these requirements are met. By contrast, there is a dispute about the fourth requirement, Indonesia arguing in its first jurisdictional objection that it has not consented to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration (B. below).\n\n3.2 Jurisdictional requirements under the BIT\n---------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nArticle XI of the BIT reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n1. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an investor of the other party relating to an investment, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.\n\n2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled through consultations and negotiations, the investor in question may submit the dispute, for settlement:\n\na. in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Party which has admitted the investment to the competent judicial or administrative bodies of that Party; or\n\nb. to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\") for the application of the conciliation or arbitration procedures provided by the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the Convention\").\n\n[...]\n\n4. Where a dispute is referred to the Centre pursuant to subparagraph 2(b):\n\na. where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other Party shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days of receiving such a request from the investor; or\n\nb. if the parties to the dispute cannot agree whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure, the investor affected shall have the right to choose.\n\n91.\n\nIt is undisputed that Indonesia is a Contracting Party of the BIT, and that Planet qualifies as an \"investor of the other party\", *i.e.* of Australia. It is equally undisputed that the dispute is \"relating to an investment\".\n\n92.\n\nIt is further common ground that Article III(1)(a) of the BIT sets out two additional requirements for jurisdiction, namely (i) the investment must have been made in the territory of Indonesia, and (ii) it must have been granted admission under relevant foreign investment legislation. It does so in the following terms:\n\n1. This Agreement shall apply to:\n\n(a) investments of investors of Australia in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the Law No. 1 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment or with any law amending or replacing it.\n\n93.\n\nIn this latter respect, the Tribunal notes that the 1967 Foreign Investment Law was amended by Law No. 11 of 1970,102 and replaced on 26 April 2007 by Law No. 25 of 2007 concerning Investment (\"2007 Investment Law\").103\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2**).\n\nLaw No. 25 on Investment (2007) (**Exh.CLA-4**).\n\n94.\n\nWhile it is undisputed that Planet made an investment in the territory of Indonesia, the Parties diverge on the fulfillment of the second requirement contained in Article III(1)(a), which is the subject of Indonesia's second jurisdictional objection (C. below).\n\n3.3 Rules for treaty interpretation\n-----------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the BIT must be interpreted pursuant to the rules of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) which codifies customary international law (see below \u00b6\u00b6 147-151).\n\n3.4 Test for jurisdiction\n-------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAt the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must establish (i) that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met, which includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, and (ii) that it has a *prima facie* cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are susceptible of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they are ultimately proven. The Tribunal finds that this test strikes a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a less exacting standard which would confer excessive weight to the Claimant's own characterization of its claims.\n\n**B. FIRST OBJECTION: CONSENT**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nIndonesia challenges jurisdiction on the ground that it has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction under the Australia-Indonesia BIT.104 Bearing in mind the fundamental requirement of State consent under international law (1.1. below) and the general rules of treaty interpretation (1.2. below), Indonesia argues in essence that Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT does not provide consent to ICSID arbitration with respect to Planet's claims (1.3. below). More specifically, Indonesia contends that the wording \"shall consent in writing [\u2026] within forty-five days\" contained in Article XI(4) shows that a subsequent act is required to achieve consent and that Indonesia legitimately withheld its consent (1.4. below). Finally, Indonesia submits that the BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not encompass Indonesia's consent to ICSID arbitration of the claims asserted by Planet (1.5. below), and that, in any event, they do not extend to Planet (1.6. below).\n\nIt should be noted that in its submissions on Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT Indonesia essentially relies on its analysis developed on Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, as well as on the legal authorities provided in the context of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 between Churchill Mining Plc and Indonesia. *See* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39 (\"Therefore, the analysis that Respondent developed regarding Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT [in the context of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14] is applicable here with equal, if not greater, force because a treaty provision which requires that consent be given within a specific timeframe at the request of the investor after the emergence of the dispute cannot reasonably be construed as supplying that very consent. The legal authorities that Respondent provided regarding the proper interpretation of Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT are also all relevant here\"). Accordingly, some of the references below are taken from Indonesia's submissions on the \"shall assent\" clause filed in the context of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14.\n\n1.1 State consent is a fundamental requirement under international law\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nIndonesia recalls that the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals is based on the consent of States, and that various ICSID tribunals have described consent as the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals.105 State consent cannot be presumed; it must be established by definitive evidence.106 In the framework of ICSID, \"consent must be supplied by a written manifestation of consent\".107\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 142-143; Tr. 13052013, 131:21-133:4.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 145; Tr. 13052013, 132:19-25. The Respondent relies in particular on the *Daimler* decision, where it was held that \"it is not possible to presume that consent has been given by a state [\u2026] Non-consent is the default rule; consent is the exception. Establishing consent therefore requires affirmative evidence\". **Exh. RLA-020**, \u00b6 175.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 146.\n\n1.2 The rules on treaty interpretation as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIndonesia argues that Article XI must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31-33 of the VCLT. In this respect, Indonesia puts emphasis on the ordinary meaning of the provision; a holistic approach, considering the object and purpose of the BIT, does not justify disregarding the words themselves.108 Indonesia also claims that \"interpretation of a treaty cannot amount to its revision\".109 Finally, for Indonesia, the Tribunal should apply the principle of contemporaneity and determine the original will of the Contracting States, instead of adopting an evolutionary interpretation of the dispute settlement clause contained in the BIT.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 149 (\"Under Article 31, a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of the treaty's object and purpose.

It finds that Planet's position regarding the interpretation of Article XI of the Treaty has been \"characterized by a series of volte-faces and vacillations\".110 In its Request for Arbitration, Planet sought to ground the Tribunal's jurisdiction exclusively on the alleged consent in Article XI of the Treaty.111 Then, in its Memorial, Planet conceded that Article XI requires an additional act of consent and argued that this additional consent was to be found in the BKPM approvals.112 And yet again in its Reply and at the hearing, Planet contended that the Australia-Indonesia BIT enshrines Indonesia's advance consent.113\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 35; Tr. 13052013, 151:10-152:4. *See also* : Tr. 14052013, 136:4-8.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 35, referencing to P-RFA, \u00b6 49.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 207; Rejoinder, \u00b6 35, referencing to Mem., \u00b6 337 (\"Unlike Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, the clause that Indonesia \u2018shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days' appears to require an additional act of consent on the part of Indonesia\").\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 35, referencing to Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 132-133.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, for consent to be established, the State must perform a further act following the submission of a request by a claimant. In support of this position, Indonesia advances essentially six arguments: first, the ordinary meaning of the terms contained in Article XI (4) is clear - the terms require an additional act of consent to be submitted within forty-five days of the filing of the request for arbitration; second, the structure of the Australia-Indonesia BIT, in particular the link between Articles XI and III(1), confirms the ordinary meaning of \"shall consent in writing\"; third, the object and purpose of a treaty cannot defeat its plain language; fourth, particular attention must be paid to the principle of contemporaneity; fifth, doctrinal writings support Indonesia's understanding of Article XI; and sixth, third-party treaties concluded by Australia confirm Indonesia's position.\n\n102.\n\nFirst and foremost, Indonesia argues that the ordinary meaning of the expression \"shall consent in writing [\u2026] within forty-five days\" in Article XI(4) of the BIT cannot be understood as conferring automatic jurisdiction to the Tribunal. This provision expresses a *pactum de contrahendo* whereby the Contracting State must and can only give its consent within 45 days after the filing of a request by a qualifying investor.114 Indonesia contrasts this clause with the \"hereby consents\" or similar clauses found in the other BITs.115 The latter provide *ex ante* consent, while the former envisages *ex post* consent to be provided on an *ad hoc* basis.116 Therefore, in the absence of a subsequent declaration, the Tribunal cannot but deny its jurisdiction.117\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 151.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 45.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 39.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 208; Tr. 13052013, 158:13-16.\n\n103.\n\nSecond, the structure of the dispute settlement provision and the link to other jurisdictional requirements confirm Indonesia's position. Article XI(4) establishes a two-step mechanism whereby the investor first submits a request and the host State thereafter has 45 days to provide its consent.118 \"Obviously, a treaty provision which states that a consent shall be given within a specific timeframe at the request of the investor cannot reasonably be interpreted as supplying the very consent\".119 Indonesia accordingly refutes Planet's submission that Article XI(2) of the Treaty already contains the Contracting States' advance consent, since Article XI(4) expressly refers back to and thus qualifies Article XI(2). Indeed, Article XI(4) is \"part and parcel\" and does not fall outside the \"four corners of the operative dispute settlement arrangements\" as argued by the Claimant.120 Article XI(2) contains a generic reference to ICSID and Article XI(4) specifies how consent in writing shall be provided.121\n\nTr. 13052013, 150:25-151:5.\n\nTr. 13052013, 151:5-9.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 48.\n\n104.\n\nIndonesia also rejects Planet's argumentation on Article XI(5). Article XI(4) and Article XI(5) both refer back to Article XI(2) and the link between paragraphs 5 and 2 is \"premised on the assumption that such an action can be taken pursuant to the mechanism laid down in Article XI(4) because Article XI(4) specified the modus operandi by means of which a dispute can be submitted to ICSID arbitration\".122\n\nTr. 13052013, 157:9-158:9. *See also* : Rejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent further contrasts the language employed in paragraph 4 from the one in paragraph 3, the latter providing \"consent to UNCITRAL arbitration by stating \u2018shall be bound to submit', but Article XI(4) does not employ that kind of language, and instead refers to an obligation to consent in the future to the referral of a dispute to ICSID\".123\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 27.\n\n106.\n\nFor Indonesia, the two-step mechanism contained in Article XI(4) of the Treaty entails that Indonesia may refuse to consent if other jurisdictional requirements are not fulfilled,124 in particular, if the investment has not been granted admission in accordance with Indonesia's Foreign Investment Law as required by Article III(1) of the BIT.125 In this context, Indonesia relies on *Desert Line v. Yemen*, where the tribunal held that some States \"require that investors wishing to be protected must identify themselves, on the footing that only specifically approved investments will give rise to benefits under the relevant treaty\".126 The tribunal, which expressly referred to the Australia-Indonesia BIT,127 went on to state that \"[t]his is a different approach, but it too has a legitimate policy rationale, in the sense that the Governments of such States evidently wish to exercise a qualitative control on the types of investments which are indeed to be promoted and protected\".128\n\nTr. 13052013, 134:11-16.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 186; Tr. 13052013, 149:21-24.\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v.

It follows that, under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, a treaty's object and purpose is to be used only to clarify the text, not to provide independent sources of meaning that contradict the clear text\".132\n\nTr. 13052013, 137:5-7.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 177, citing *United States v. Iran*, Decision No. 130-A28-FT, 19 December 2000, 36 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 5, \u00b6 58 (**Exh. RLA-052**).\n\n109.\n\nFourth, Indonesia asserts that the BIT must be interpreted according to the principle of contemporaneity, which requires interpreting a treaty by reference to the understanding of its terms at the time when it was concluded.133\n\nTr. 13052013, 176:26-177:6.\n\n110.\n\nFifth, Indonesia relies on various doctrinal writings echoing its interpretation of Article XI of the Treaty. For instance, referring to the Australia-Indonesia BIT, Michael Pryles and Richard Garnett write that Australia's BITs \"require the host State to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to ICSID (usually within 30 or 45 days)\" and that \"[w]ithout such consent an ICSID arbitral tribunal will not have jurisdiction\".134 In addition, Indonesia refers to scholarly writings it filed in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 in support of its interpretation of Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT.135 These opinions underline that a promise to consent does not provide the investor with an immediate right to resort to international arbitration.136\n\nMichael Pryles & Richard Garnett, \"Australia\", in Michael Pryles (ed), *Dispute Resolution in Asia* (Kluwer Law, 2006), p. 82 and n. 174 (**Exh.

For its argument that Article XI(4)(a) cannot be dissociated from Article XI(2), Indonesia relies on Australia's treaties with the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, which articulate the abovementioned two-step procedure in a single paragraph.137 For instance, Article 11(3)(a) of the Australia-Czech Republic BIT provides as follows:\n\n\"(3) Either party to a dispute may take the following action irrespective of whether any local remedies available pursuant to action under paragraph (2) of this Article have already been pursued or exhausted:\n\n(a) if both Contracting Parties are at that time party to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the Convention\"), refer the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\") for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Article 28 or 36 of the Convention. Where this action is taken by an investor of one Contracting Party the other Contracting Party shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days of receiving such a request from the investor\".138\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, referring to the Agreement between Australia and the Czech Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 11 (3)(a) (**Exh.

RLA-087**.\n\n112.\n\nAustralia's BITs with Argentina and Turkey also confirm Indonesia's interpretation as they expressly incorporate the Contracting States' advance consent, thus showing that Australia is aware of the difference between consent and a promise to consent.139 Finally, the Australia-Sri Lanka BIT serves to refute Planet's submission that Article XI(4)(a) of the Treaty serves no other purpose than \"administrative convenience\". That treaty makes it clear that a subsequent act is required in order to access ICSID, failing which consent is deemed to exist for non-institutional arbitration as provided in that treaty.140\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 45, referring to the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Argentine Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, and Protocol, Art. 13(4) (**Exh.

The fact that some NIAs mention that Australia may have to bear the costs of an arbitration is inconclusive.141 Planet's argument that where NIAs are silent on consent then the underlying treaty must be understood to contain binding consent is belied by the NIA prepared for the Australia-Sri Lanka BIT, which does not mention the requirement for additional consent, although Planet acknowledged that such treaty did so require.142\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 28, referring to Australia-Peru BIT National Interest Analysis (\"NIA\"), p. 2 (**Exh.

Indonesia further asserts that any challenge of its refusal is subject to the State-to-State dispute resolution mechanism provided in the BIT. In other words, this Tribunal is the wrong tribunal and the Claimant is the wrong party for that hypothetical dispute.145\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 212\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n1.5 The BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not contain consent to ICSID arbitration of Planet's claims\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIndonesia submits that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval does not constitute consent to ICSID arbitration, because (i) the BKPM does not have authority to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, (ii) the wording of Section IX(4) does not include consent on the part of Indonesia, because the word *bersedia* means \"is prepared/ready\"146 and not \"is willing\" as proposed by the Claimant;147 (iii) in any event, Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval only extends to PT ICD and not to the Claimant,148 and (iv) the Australia-Indonesia BIT only contemplates consent given by Indonesia after the request has been submitted to ICSID, as opposed to consent given through an instrument drafted in 2005.149\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 192. *See* the Respondent's translation of the BKPM Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005 (**Exh.

Indeed, none of the Requests for Arbitration referred to the 2005 BKPM Approval as source of Indonesia's consent; they only relied on the BITs. In any event, the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval shows that it only covers disputes with PT ICD.160 The word \"perusahaan\" is correctly translated as \"company\", *i.e.* PT ICD, and not as \"business\" as contended by the Claimant.161\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 189; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63; Tr. 14052013, 141:3-143:7; R-PHB1, pp. 6-8; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 1018.\n\nR-PHB1, pp. 7-8; R-PHB2, \u00b6 15.\n\n**2.

In Planet's view, \"[a]ny other finding would fly in the face of common sense, ignore the undoubted intention of the drafters of both treaties and lead to palpably absurd results\",170 and the Tribunal should retain jurisdiction.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 54.\n\nTr. 14052013, 46:10-47:1, where the Claimant referred to the following cases: *Chemtura Corporation (formerly Crompton Corporation) v.

First, paragraph 3 indicates (i) that the disputing parties may agree to *ad hoc* arbitration, and (ii) that in the absence of an agreement within three months, the dispute is to be submitted to an UNCITRAL tribunal. However, paragraph 3 only applies where one or both of the Contracting States are not ICSID members. Hence, UNCITRAL arbitration is unavailable if Indonesia and Australia are parties to the ICSID Convention, with the absurd result that Australia's investors \"would be able to enforce BIT protection through UNCITRAL, but they would lose recourse to any enforceable mechanism if Australia became an ICSID contracting state\".171\n\nTr. 14052013, 51:2-7.\n\n127.\n\nSecond, paragraph 5 confirms Planet's interpretation since it cannot have been the drafters' intention to preclude diplomatic protection if the investor's access to ICSID arbitration were not \"absolutely assured\".172 Diplomatic protection by the investor's home State is precluded once \"an action referred to in paragraph 2 has been taken\", *i.e.* once a dispute has been submitted to ICSID. There is no reference to paragraph 4 or to any additional action required from the host State.\n\nTr. 14052013, 52:4-9.\n\n128.\n\nThird, Planet argues that paragraph 4 finds application where a dispute has already been referred to ICSID pursuant to paragraph 2. Hence, Article XI(4)(a) is not concerned with obtaining the host State's consent, since that consent is already provided under Article XI(2).173 For Planet \"Article XI(4) does not in terms impinge upon an agreement to arbitrate arising under Article XI(2)\".174 Paragraph 4 \"falls outside the four corners of the operative dispute settlement arrangements\" of paragraph 2,175 since it deals with procedural matters and does not \"address the existence of an arbitration agreement *per se* \".176\n\nReply, \u00b6 148.\n\nReply, \u00b6 147.\n\nReply, \u00b6 135; Tr. 14052013, 55:16-19.\n\nReply, \u00b6 150.\n\n129.\n\nFourth, pointing to other treaties concluded around the same time and containing similar \"anachronistic references\",177 Planet contends that the drafters of Article XI(4)(a) were struggling to find ways to evidence \"consent in writing\" as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In its submission, Article XI(4)(a) is thus best understood \"as a matter of administrative convenience and good housekeeping for the benefit of the ICSID Secretariat\".178 In any event, the use of the mandatory word \"shall\" leaves no room for maneuver to Indonesia, which cannot disregard its duty under that provision.179\n\nReply, \u00b6 150, referring to the 2004 United States Model Treaty, Art. 26(2) (**Exh. CLA-94**) ; Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, Art. 8(3) (**Exh.

CLA-79**). *See also:* Tr. 14052013, 54:3-55:3.\n\nReply, \u00b6 150. At the hearing, Planet submitted that subparagraph (a) is ambiguous as to whether consent in writing is to furnished to the investor or to ICSID (Tr. 14052013, 53:12-14). In its Reply, Planet was more assertive when it stated that \"[t]he consent in writing referred to in Article XI(4)(a) is addressed \u2018 *to the Centre* ' (emphasis added), not to the investor. The obligation created by Article XI(4)(a) is to furnish *the Centre* with a copy of the host State's \u2018consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre', not to provide such consent *to the investor* \" (\u00b6 149).\n\nTr. 14052013, 55:22-56:3.\n\n130.\n\nFifth, Planet stresses that several other features of paragraph 4 are \"curious\". The wording \"where that action is taken by an investor of one party\" in subparagraph (a) gives the impression that such an action could also be taken by the host State, when investment treaty obligations fall upon the host State and the right to initiate arbitration is normally bestowed on investors only.180 Further, Planet notes that paragraph 4 is not formulated in a cumulative manner. Subparagraph (b) is introduced by the word \"or\" and therefore covers an alternative situation. Under subparagraph (b), the investor ultimately chooses between arbitration and conciliation. Hence, even if the host State fails to comply with its duty under subparagraph (a), the investor can pursue the proceedings by choosing between arbitration and conciliation under subparagraph (b).\n\nTr. 14052013, 52:20-53:9.\n\n131.\n\nPlanet claims that its interpretation of Article XI is also supported by the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to promote investments and stimulate investors' business activities.181\n\nTr. 14052013, 45:10-16.\n\n2.3. A comparison with other BITs concluded by Australia confirms Planet's interpretation\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nAccording to Planet, the wording \"shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre\" appears in thirteen of the twenty-two BITs concluded by Australia since 1988.182 Therefore Article XI of the Treaty constitutes standard Australian practice.183 If the Tribunal were to accept Indonesia's self-serving interpretation \"it would in practice undermine the procedural protections contained in the majority of Australian BITs\".184 In support, Planet relies on the ruling on interim measures in *Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan*, where the tribunal held on a *prima facie* basis that the \"shall consent in writing\" language of the Australia-Pakistan BIT \" *per se* constituted binding written consent to ICSID arbitration, without requirement of any further act of consent on the part of Pakistan\".185 In any event, counsel for Pakistan raised numerous jurisdictional objections but did not argue that the BIT did not provide Pakistan's binding consent.186\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 58 (\"The requirement in Article XI(4) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT that the host State \u2018shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre' appears in identical form in 11 other Australian BITs spanning the decade between 1991 and 2001. It was incorporated in approximately two-thirds of Australian BITs signed between 1988 and 1995, and appears in over half of Australia's total portfolio of BITs\", references omitted).\n\nC- PHB1, \u00b6 58; C-PHB2, \u00b6 13(ii).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 58.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 13(iv); C-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75. *See* **Exh. CLA-159**.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 75.\n\n133.\n\nSimilarly, Planet argues that Australian treaty drafters employ very different language when requiring an additional act of consent, as the dispute settlement provision of Australia's BITs with India and Sri Lanka.187 The first reads as follows:\n\n\"if [...] both Parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit the dispute to [ICSID] such a dispute shall be referred to the Centre\".188\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70; C-PHB2, \u00b6 13(iii).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69; C-PHB2, \u00b6 13(iii).\n\n134.\n\nAnd the second reads in relevant part:\n\n\"(a) where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other Party should consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days of receiving such a request from the investor. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld\".189\n\nC-PHB1, n. 76; **Exh. RLA-092**, Art. 13(3)(a).\n\n135.\n\nAs regards Article 12(2) of the Australia-Vietnam BIT, ICSID jurisdiction is predicated on the ratification of the ICSID Convention by both States, but it does not require an additional act of consent. According to Planet, Article 12(2) of that treaty covers three possibilities:\n\n\"i. both State Parties have ratified the ICSID Convention (Article 12(2)(b));\n\nii. *neither* State Party has ratified the ICSID Convention (Article 12(2)(c), subordinate clause 1); or\n\niii. *either* the investor does not consent to ICSID arbitration, although its State of nationality has ratified the ICSID Convention, *or* the State party to the dispute has not ratified the ICSID Convention (Article 12(2)(c), subordinate clause 2)\".190\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 79.\n\n136.\n\nThe National Interest Analyses (NIAs) prepared by the Australian Government in connection with BITs discussed in the Australian parliament confirm that Article XI of the Treaty contains Indonesia's advance consent. The NIAs issued in conjunction with the BITs concluded by Australia with Peru, Pakistan, Lithuania and Egypt contain dispute settlement provisions that are identical to those of the Australia-Indonesia BIT. None of these NIAs mention the necessity of an additional act of consent by the host State, but rather work on the assumption that the investor has discretion to refer a dispute to ICSID.191 For instance, the NIA to the Australia-Peru BIT observes the following:\n\n\"It is also possible, given that Australia and Peru are both party to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States as specified in Article 13.2.b, that a Peruvian investor may refer a dispute relating to an investment with Australia to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) (Article 13.2.b). In this case, Australia may be required to bear all or part of the cost of arbitration, subject to the discretion of the tribunal\".192\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 59-68; C-PHB2, \u00b6 13(ii).\n\nAustralia-Peru BIT NIA (**Exh. CLa-154**). Planet also refers to: Australia-Lithuania BIT NIA (**Exh. CLA-156**) ; Australia-Egypt BIT NIA (**Exh. CLA-157**) ; and Australia-Pakistan BIT NIA (**Exh. CLA-155**).\n\n137.\n\nWhere the treaty drafters however wished to require an additional act of consent, this issue was specifically identified as the NIA for the Australia-India BIT demonstrates:\n\n\"Under Article 12.3, the option of referring a dispute between a contracting Party and an investor of the other contracting Party to the [ICSID] was, at India's request, made subject to the agreement of both Parties to a dispute. As India is not a Party to the ICSID Convention, this formulation was necessary to provide that the agreement referred to in ICSID in accordance with the Australian Model Text would only operate if India were to agree to submit a dispute to that forum\".193\n\n**Exh. CLA-158**.\n\n2.4 Indonesia's reliance on doctrinal writings is mistaken\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nPlanet challenges Indonesia's reliance on doctrinal writings as being \"misleading in its breadth and mistaken in its content\".194 Indonesia's interpretation is not substantiated by any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* relating to Indonesia's own treaties.195 Nor do the commentators cited by Indonesia rely on preparatory materials relating to the Australia-Indonesia BIT.196\n\nReply, \u00b6 113.\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n139.\n\nFor the Claimant none of the authors having analyzed Australian BITs have cited any authority in support of their opinion that Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT only contains a promise to consent. Michael Pryles and Richard Garnett rely on their own reasoning,197 while Jason Webb Yackee cites Christoph Schreuer's analysis of \"shall assent\" or similarly worded clauses in support of his interpretation.198 Like all the other authors relied upon by Indonesia, Schreuer relies on Broches' analysis, who himself cites nothing in support of his view. Through a \"citation chain\" dating back to Broches,199 authors have reproduced the same mistaken interpretation. That interpretation has become \"conventional wisdom\", but is no evidence of the intent of the drafters.200\n\nTr. 140502013, 44:5-9, referring to **Exh. CLA-083**.\n\nTr. 14052013, 44:9-45:1, referring to **Exh. CLA-069** (where the author acknowledges in note 64 that his \"classification scheme draws heavily\" on Schreuer) and **Exh. CLA-084** (where there is no reference supporting the author's interpretation).\n\nReply, \u00b6 118.\n\nTr. 13052013, 11:7-11.\n\n2.5 Indonesia has provided its consent under the BKPM Approvals\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that the Australia-Indonesia BIT requires an additional act of consent, Planet argues that the Respondent has given such consent in the 2005 BKPM Approval. This consent was transferred to the Claimant upon its acquisition of shares in PT ICD through the 2006 BKPM Approval, which incorporated the 2005 BKPM Approval.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant disputes that the BKPM Approvals only extend to PT ICD and not to its shareholders. Relying on *Noble Energy v. Ecuador*, the Claimant disputes that the Respondent granted its consent only to PT ICD \"when the only manner in which that company could benefit from such consent would be under investment treaties [...] to which it would resort by virtue of its foreign ownership\".201\n\nReply, \u00b6 156.\n\n142.\n\nPlanet further relies on *Amco v. Indonesia* and *Holiday Inns v. Morocco* for the proposition that a host State's consent contained in domestic instruments, such as contracts concluded with or licenses granted to local subsidiaries, extends to the foreign investors insofar as they carry out their obligations under the contract.202 The Claimant argues that, together with Churchill, it is the driving force behind PT ICD's activities and that it funded these activities allocating resources to the EKCP project. Therefore, it is \"reasonable to interpret the ICSID consent granted by the Respondent as intended to protect its rights as investor as well, especially since they overlap almost entirely with those of PT ICD\".203\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 157-158.\n\nReply, \u00b6 159. *See also* : C-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 21-27.\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on evidence of Dr. Makarim, who notes that the inclusion of an ICSID dispute settlement clause in BKPM approvals is not standard practice.204 In spite of a divergent practice, reference to ICSID dispute settlement was expressly included here and granted to a local company that was in foreign hands at 95% from its inception and at 100% since the Claimants' acquisition. For these reasons, Dr. Makarim is of the view that the \"deliberate insertion of the clause [\u2026] must be interpreted as the Government's intention to follow the [ICSID] Convention's dictates in settling disputes\".205\n\nReply, \u00b6 155; Makarim ER2, p. 10.\n\nMakarim ER2, p. 10.\n\n144.\n\nWith regard to the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant translates the Indonesian word *bersedia* as \"is willing\".206 Hence, Section IX(4) expresses the willingness to follow the ICSID procedures. Planet also refutes the Respondent's allegation that the BKPM lacked authority to agree to ICSID arbitration, observing that the BKPM Approval was copied to the President's office and various other Ministries.207 Had the BKPM overstepped its authority, the President would presumably have taken appropriate action.\n\nForeign Capital Investment Approval for PT ICD, Decision No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005 (with Certificate of Translation) para. 3 (**Exh.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n3.1 Consent to ICSID arbitration in general\n-------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires consent of the Parties to be bound to arbitrate under the ICSID regime. Several arbitral tribunals have taken the position that the expression of consent to ICSID arbitration must be \"clear and unambiguous\",209 or that consent must be proven through \"affirmative evidence\".210 Except for calling for a writing, the ICSID Convention contains no particular requirement of clarity or otherwise. Hence, the Tribunal will assess consent pursuant to the general rules on treaty interpretation.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v.

RLA-020**).\n\n3.2 The Tribunal's interpretative approach\n------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe interpretation of the Australia-Indonesia BIT is governed by Articles 31-32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT),211 which codify customary international law.212\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 243 (**Exh.

Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005, \u00b6 88 (**Exh. RLA-028**). Australia acceded to the VCLT on 13 June 1974. Indonesia has not ratified the VCLT.\n\n148.\n\nWhen interpreting the BIT and seeking to assess the common intention of the Contracting States, account must be taken of the special nature of investor-State arbitration, namely that the home State of the investor is not a party to the arbitration. It does not have the opportunity to present its views on the interpretation of \"its\" treaty nor to produce evidence in support, unlike the host State. This asymmetry inherent in investment treaty arbitration may justify recourse to the Tribunal's procedural powers under Rules 34 and 37 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n149.\n\nAccording to Article 31 VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". No special rule applies to the interpretation of a dispute settlement provision. Hence, such treaty provisions must be construed like any other, neither restrictively nor broadly. Or in the words of *Amco* :\n\n\"[L]ike any other conventions, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively*, nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly or liberally*. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties; such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law\".213\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, Award on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, 1 ICSID Reports (1983) 389 (**Exh. CLA-38**). *See also* *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, \u00b6 43 (**Exh. CLA-128**) (\"In the Tribunal's view, there is no principle either of extensive or restrictive interpretation of jurisdictional provisions in treaties. In the end the question is what the relevant provisions mean, interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of interpretation of treaties. These are set out in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which for this purpose can be taken to reflect the position under customary law\").\n\n150.\n\nThe Parties concur, and rightly so, that the starting point for treaty interpretation is the text.214 The ordinary meaning of the text must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty's object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting States related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law binding the Contracting States.215\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties (1966), Art. 27 and 28, \u00b6 18, p. 220, par.

Pursuant to Article 32, one may resort to supplementary means of interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or (ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\", or (iii) \"leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\". In *HICEE*, the tribunal noted that supplementary means are not a closed category.216\n\n*HICEE BV v. Slovak Republic*, Partial Award, 23 May 2011, \u00b6 117.\n\n3.3 Does Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT contain Indonesia's advance consent?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nIndonesia submits that it has not consented in advance to ICSID arbitration. Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT is not a standing offer to arbitrate. It merely constitutes a promise to consent. Indonesia also submits that the BKPM Approvals do not express consent to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal will first determine whether the BIT contains a standing offer of ICSID arbitration and only analyze the second objection if necessary.\n\n153.\n\nArticle XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"1. In the event of a dispute between a Party and an investor of the other Party relating to an investment, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.\n\n2. In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled through consultations and negotiations, the investor in question may submit the dispute for settlement:\n\na. In accordance with the laws and regulations of the Party which has admitted the investment to the competent judicial or administrative bodies of that Party; or\n\nb. To the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\") for the application of the conciliation or arbitration procedures provided by the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the Convention\").\n\n3. If both Parties are not at the same time the dispute arises party to the Convention, the dispute may be submitted to such procedures for settlement as may be agreed between the parties to the dispute. If no such procedures have been agreed within a three month period from written notification of the claim, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in force. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to award interest. The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify those Rules.\n\n4. Where a dispute is referred to the Centre pursuant to sub-paragraph 2(b):\n\na. Where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other Party shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days of receiving such a request from the investor; or\n\nb. If the parties to the dispute cannot agree whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure, the investor affected shall have the right to choose.\n\n5. Once an action referred to in paragraph 2 has been taken, neither Party shall pursue the dispute through diplomatic channels unless:\n\na. the relevant judicial or administrative body, the arbitral authority or other body, as the case may be, has decided that it has no jurisdiction in relation to the dispute in question; or\n\nb. the other Party has failed to abide by or comply with any judgment, award, order or other determination made by the body in question.\n\n6. In any proceeding involving a dispute relating to an investment, a Party shall not assert, as a defence, counter-claim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the investor concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of any alleged loss\".\n\n154.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, Article XI of the Treaty contemplates a two-step process in which the foreign investor first submits a request for arbitration and Indonesia then gives its consent.217 The natural and ordinary meaning of \"shall consent\" contained in Article XI(4)(a) implies a future action, a separate, subsequent act of consent each time an investor seeks to engage in ICSID arbitration. Article XI(4) only encompasses a promise to consent or *pactum de contrahendo*.\n\nTr. 13052013, 134:11-16.\n\n155.\n\nIndonesia acknowledges that in principle it is required to grant its consent.218 It submits, however, that it is entitled to review on a case-by-case basis whether the jurisdictional requirements set in the Treaty are fulfilled. In particular, it argues that it is required to give its consent only if it is established (after the filing of the request for arbitration) that the investment was granted admission as required under Article III(1) of the BIT. Since Planet failed to conform to the requirements of Article III(1), Indonesia is entitled to withhold its consent. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find that the Article III(1) objection is ill-founded, it would lack jurisdiction, because Indonesia has not given its consent.219 For Indonesia, the inter-State arbitration provided in Article XII of the Treaty is designed to address whether a host State is bound to grant its consent or not.220\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 187.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 66.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 65. *See also* : Tr. 13052013, 163:23-165:11.\n\n156.\n\nFor its part, Planet argues that Article XI(2) fulfills the requirement of consent in writing by the host State under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. No further action is required from the host State after the request for arbitration. Article XI(4) falls outside the four corners of the arbitration clause found in Article XI(2) and (3). In any event, Article XI(4)(a) imposes an obligation on Indonesia since the ordinary meaning of the word \"shall\" denotes a legally binding obligation.221 It was thus the intent of the treaty drafters to provide investors with the certainty of access to ICSID arbitration where both BIT States are ICSID members.\n\nReply, \u00b6 95.\n\n157.\n\nThe Parties' disagreement hinges on the interpretation and articulation of paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article XI of the BIT. In a nutshell, the question is whether paragraph 4 qualifies paragraph 2. It is a difficult question that the Tribunal will seek to resolve by relying first on the ordinary meaning of the words before turning to the context and the object and purpose of the Treaty.\n\n158.\n\nBefore turning to the ordinary meaning of the words, the Tribunal stresses that it is not unusual for States in bilateral investment treaties to qualify the host State's consent to international arbitration. For instance, some BITs require the investor to exhaust local remedies, or, to the contrary, to waive the right to initiate other proceedings. Others make access to international arbitration contingent upon the lapsing of negotiation or cooling-off periods or upon an attempt to resolve the dispute in court during a certain time. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not minded to accept Planet's argument as such that Article XI(4) falls outside the operative dispute settlement arrangements contained in the two previous paragraphs, all the more so that Article XI(4) expressly refers to Article XI(2)(b).\n\n159.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the words used in paragraph 2 appears clear. In the absence of an amicable solution, \"the investor in question may submit the dispute for settlement to [the local courts or] to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes [...]\". The word \"may\" seems to indicate that the investor is entitled to institute ICSID proceedings if it so chooses. The right of initiative rests with the foreign investor and there is no limitation placed on this right in this paragraph.\n\n160.\n\nThe difficulty in this case arises from the context of paragraph 2 and specifically from paragraph 4. Under that paragraph, if a dispute is referred to the Centre under paragraph 2(b), the host State \"shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days of receiving such a request from the investor\".\n\n161.\n\nThe words employed in paragraph 4(a) are also clear. If the host State \"shall consent in writing within 45 days\" after the investor's request, it follows that consent cannot be located in the Treaty itself and that a separate act is needed. The words used in paragraph 4(a) call for a number of comments.\n\n162.\n\nFirst, \"shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days\" implies a time sequence. The phrase lends support to the view that the investor must first file a request and only thereafter will the host State \"consent\" within 45 days. The Tribunal will revert below to the question whether under the Treaty the host State can only provide its consent after the filing of a request for arbitration or whether such consent can also be provided in a separate act in advance of the request (see below \u00b6\u00b6 200-202).\n\n163.\n\nAs to the word \"shall\", it can either imply an obligation (suggesting that the Respondent's submission to ICSID is mandatory) or refer to a future action (suggesting the contrary). Be this as it may, even if \"shall\" expresses an obligation of the State to give its consent, the sanction for a failure to do so would not be to supply the missing consent or to deem that constructive consent exists. Hence, whatever the meaning of \"shall\", it does not advance the analysis.\n\n164.\n\nSecond, Article XI(4)(a) provides that the host State shall \"consent in writing\". On the one hand, one can place the emphasis on \"consent\", which favors the Respondent's thesis. Consent is a term of foundational importance in the area of international dispute settlement. In the ICSID framework, disputing parties are required to \"consent in writing\" to ICSID arbitration. On the other hand, one can focus on the words \"in writing\", which would support the Claimant's view to a certain extent. One possibility may be that the drafters of the Australia-Indonesia BIT were grappling with ways to prove the Contracting Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration. Indeed, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, just as Rule 2(2) of the Institution Rules, require consent to be expressed in writing. The treaty drafters may have sought to devise ways to secure such consent in writing, not being certain that consent in the BIT met the writing requirement. The Claimant insists that this was a \"feature of the time at which the BIT was drafted\", and points to other BITs concluded by other States which expressly state that the expression of consent contained in these treaties fulfills the requirement of consent in writing under the ICSID or other frameworks.222 The Tribunal finds reliance on BITs concluded by other States inapposite here since they all use language which is lacking in Article XI(4) of the Treaty.\n\nReply, \u00b6 150, n. 178-179.\n\n165.\n\nThird, \"[w]here a dispute is referred to the Centre\" and \"that action is taken by an investor\", Article XI(4)(a) sets a time limit for the host State to give its consent \"within forty-five days of receiving such request from the investor\". In other words, the 45 day time period runs from the initiation of the arbitration procedure. Article XI(4)(a) is specific in providing the time limit, the date when it starts, and the action expected from the host State within this time.\n\n166.\n\nThe mechanism contemplated in Article XI(4) poses a difficulty in the ICSID framework. Indeed, in the ICSID regime, consent must exist on the day of the filing of the request for arbitration.223 This derives from Institution Rule 2(1)(c) which provides that the request for arbitration must indicate the date of consent,224 and from Institution Rule 2(2) which requires consent to be documented. Further, Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention directs the Secretary-General to refuse to register a request for arbitration when consent is manifestly lacking. To achieve consent on the day of filing, the investor would have to seek consent before it files its request. Although this solution is conceivable, it does not reflect what Article XI(4) says. This difficulty could be seen as an indication that Article XI(4) is \"a matter of administrative convenience and good housekeeping for the benefit of the ICSID Secretariat\" to use the Claimant's words.225 However, the Claimant has provided no authority or evidence supporting this view. Moreover, the characterization as a mere formality would have to be read into the provision, which does not use words suggesting a formality, quite to the contrary. Further, the very existence of a time limit for the performance of an act would rather weigh against a matter of convenience and in favor of a requirement conditioning the Centre's action.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, \u00b6 24 (\"Consent of the parties must exist when the Centre is seized (Art. 28(3) and 36(3)) but the Convention does not otherwise specify the time at which consent should be given\").\n\nRule 2(3) defines the \"date of consent\" as \"the date on which the parties to the dispute consented in writing to submit it to the Centre; if both parties did not act on the same day, it means the date on which the second party acted\".\n\nReply, \u00b6 150.\n\n167.\n\nIn sum, the ordinary meaning of paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article XI(4) is clear for each provision taken separately. It is their interaction which creates some uncertainty. However, lacking any further indication on the common intention of the Contracting States beyond the text of the Treaty, the Tribunal is inclined to conclude at this stage that Article XI does not express Indonesia's advance consent to ICSID proceedings. It would be doing violence to the clear terms of Article XI(4)(a) to reduce this clause to a mere administrative formality for ICSID.\n\n168.\n\nTurning now to the context of Article XI(2) and (4), the Tribunal does not believe that the use of the word \"or\" separating Article XI(4)(a) from Article XI(4)(b) is significant. Planet argues that the disjunctive \"or\" shows that if Indonesia fails to provide its consent in writing within the allocated time, then under sub-paragraph (b) the investor has the right to choose between conciliation and arbitration. A review of Australian BITs containing similar dispute settlement clauses shows that Australia always used the term \"and\" between these two provisions and that the BIT with Indonesia is the only one where the word \"or\" appears. Hence, the Tribunal believes that the inclusion of \"or\" is the result of an infelicitous drafting rather than a deliberate choice entailing specific consequences. In any event, Planet's argument fails since sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) deal with entirely distinct matters.\n\n169.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimant further argued that it would be absurd to allow the investor access to UNCITRAL under Article XI(3) as long as one or both Contracting States are not ICSID members, but to deny the investor access both to UNCITRAL and to ICSID when the Contracting States are ICSID members. Article XI(3) provides that an investor is entitled to refer the dispute to UNCITRAL proceedings (unless another dispute settlement mechanism is agreed) if one or both Contracting States are not ICSID members at the time when the dispute arises. Since both Australia and Indonesia were ICSID members at the time of the conclusion of the BIT, Article XI(3) could only come into play if one of them were to denounce the ICSID Convention. It is also noteworthy that a failure to abide by the requirements of Article XI(4)(a) does not open the door to UNCITRAL arbitration as a default mechanism. Thus, if one follows Indonesia's interpretation, Planet could well be barred from ICSID arbitration (because Indonesia does not consent under Article XI(4)(a)) *and* from UNCITRAL arbitration (because both Contracting States are ICSID members). This is undoubtedly a surprising and unsatisfactory result. Yet, it is the result that derives from the text of the Treaty and the Tribunal cannot change the text, especially not in the absence of *travaux* that would shed a different light on the words. As was stated in *Renta 4*, the Tribunal's task is to discover, not to invent, meaning.226\n\n*Renta 4 S.V.S.A. v. The Russian Federation*, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award on Preliminary Objections, 20 March 2009, \u00b6 93. *See also* : *Daimler*, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.\n\n170.\n\nIn the same vein, Article XI(5) does not support the Claimant's interpretation. This provision postulates that the home State is precluded from exercising diplomatic protection \"[o]nce an action referred to in paragraph 2 has been taken\", *i.e.* once a dispute has been referred to ICSID. It is consistent with Article 27 of the ICSID Convention in precluding diplomatic protection as long as the Centre is seized of a dispute, and therefore sheds no light on the interaction between Article XI(2) and (4). The Tribunal sees no tension between Article XI(4) and (5). The home State cannot exercise diplomatic protection from the time the request is filed with ICSID and the host State must give its consent at the latest 45 days thereafter. If the host State fails to give its consent by that time, the home State's prerogative to use diplomatic means revives once the Secretary-General of the Centre refuses to register the request under Article 36(3) of the Convention or the Tribunal decides that it has no jurisdiction under Article 41 of the Convention.\n\n171.\n\nFinally, the Claimant opposes Indonesia's argument that any failure to abide by the requirements of Article XI(4)(a) must be resolved before an inter-State tribunal, because that tribunal could not supply the missing consent. It is correct that an inter-State tribunal would not be in a position to procure Indonesia's missing consent. It could only order specific performance. It would be left to Indonesia to abide by such an order with the result that the investor might still be left without recourse to ICSID arbitration. Consequently, the debate whether Indonesia has discretion to grant consent especially by reference to the admission requirement of the Treaty, as the Respondent argues, or whether it lacks any latitude in this respect, as the Claimant submits, does not advance matters much. Its outcome may determine the outcome of an inter-State arbitration. It says nothing about the jurisdiction of an investor-State tribunal. For that tribunal's jurisdiction to exist consent is needed; an obligation to consent is insufficient.\n\n172.\n\nAfter the context, the Tribunal must address the object and purpose of the Treaty. In its view, the object and purpose are neutral for present purposes. The preamble of the Australia-Indonesia BIT states that Australia and Indonesia strive \"to create favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Party in the territory of the other Party\".227 The preamble further provides that both States recognize \"that promoting the flow of capital for economic activity and development is important for the expansion of their economic relations and cooperation, the stimulation of their investors' business initiative and the fostering of prosperity in both countries\".228 In other words, the preamble refers to both the private interests of the investor as well as the public interests of the State. It is thus of little assistance in the present context.\n\nAustralia-Indonesia BIT, preamble (**Exh. R-002**).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n173.\n\nIn sum, the interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the terms employed in paragraphs (2) and (4) in light of this context leads to the conclusion that Article XI does not contain Indonesia's advance consent to ICSID proceedings. This is confirmed by the supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention upon which the Parties relied, *i.e.* doctrinal writings and treaty practice.\n\n174.\n\nIndonesia pointed to various commentators defining categories of expressions of consent to international arbitration and making a general distinction between advance consent and a promise to consent.229 Indonesia also quoted various authors adopting the position that the dispute settlement clause in the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains a promise to consent, and that a failure to fulfill this promise can only be resolved through inter-State dispute settlement.230\n\nAron Broches, \u2018Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and Arbitration of Investment Disputes', in: Jan C.

He sought to distinguish different types of consent, in particular consents given in advance and promises to consent. In doing so, Broches relied on the text of the dispute settlement provisions of several Dutch and English BITs, without referring to *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* or other documents revealing the intention of the drafters.231 The same can essentially be said of the other authors whom Indonesia invokes and who ultimately all refer back to Broches.\n\nWith regard to the Netherlands BITs, and in addition to the 1968 Netherlands-Indonesia BIT, Broches refers to the 1971 Netherlands-Morocco BIT, the 1971 Netherlands-Ivory Coast BIT, the 1972 Netherlands-Singapore BIT, the 1974 Netherlands-Korea BIT, and the 1976 Netherlands-Egypt BIT. With regard to the United Kingdom BITs, Broches refers to the 1976 UK-Indonesia BIT and the 1980 UK-Philippines BIT. Finally, Broches mentions the 1977 Japan-Egypt BIT. *See* Aron Broches, \u2018Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and Arbitration of Investment Disputes', in: Jan C. Schultsz & Albert Jan Van den Berg (eds), *The Art of Arbitration. Essays on International Arbitration* (Kluwer Law, 1982), p. 66 (**Exh. RlA-036**).\n\n177.\n\nThe authors commenting more particularly on Australian BITs, and on the Australia-Indonesia BIT - again without providing evidence of the States' intention - do provide support for Indonesia's interpretation. Michael Pryles and Richard Garnett state that:\n\n\"[a] further feature of Australia's BITs is that they require the host State to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to ICSID (usually within 30 or 45 days). Without such consent an ICSID arbitral tribunal will not have jurisdiction\".232\n\nMichael Pryles & Richard Garnett, \"Australia\", in Michael Pryles (ed), *Dispute Resolution in Asia* (Kluwer Law, 2006), p. 82 and n. 174 (**Exh. RLA-083**) (references omitted).\n\n178.\n\nJason Webb Yackee holds the same opinion:\n\n\"Australia's BITs are very subtle in this regard. They generally contain a comprehensive, effective pre-consent to ad hoc arbitration, *but only* *if Australia and its treaty partner have not joined the ICSID* *Convention.* Where they both have done so, the ad hoc pre-consent becomes invalid, leaving the investor with the sole option of seeking ICSID arbitration. But as to ICSID arbitration, each state party to the Australian treaties promises only that it \"shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within forty-five days of receiving such a request from the investor\" - with the words \"shall consent\" indicating that the consent has not yet been given, but is only promised\".233\n\nJason Webb Yackee, *Sacrificing Sovereignty: Bilateral Investment Treaties, International Arbitration, and the Quest for Capital* (Chapel Hill, 2007), p. 33 (**Exh. RLA-084**).\n\n179.\n\nIn a second writing, the same author adds the following:\n\n\"[W]hen a state has promised to consent to arbitration in a treaty, a refusal to actually consent when the investor so demands is indeed a breach of the treaty under international law. But in the face of such a refusal, no matter how illegal, an international arbitral tribunal will not exercise jurisdiction over the dispute, because arbitral jurisdiction always and necessarily depends on the actual consent of the parties. This much is quite clear. Less clear is whether the reputational costs of breaching a promise to arbitrate will typically be so great that a promise to consent is for all practical purposes of as much value to the investor as an actual pre-consent\".234\n\nJason Webb Yackee, \"Conceptual Difficulties in the Empirical Study of Bilateral Investment Treaties\", 33 *Brooklyn Journal of International Law* (2008), p. 426 (**Exh. RLA-069**) (references omitted).\n\n180.\n\nIndonesia also relied on an UNCTAD study which, on the basis of its analysis of the \"shall consent in writing [\u2026] within thirty days\" clause contained in the Australia-Lithuania BIT, came to the conclusion that the treaty did not contain an expression of consent and that a refusal to grant consent would \"enable the other contracting party to pursue its right under the State-State dispute settlement mechanism\".235\n\nUNCTAD, *Bilateral Investment Treaties 1995-2006: Trends in Investment Rulemaking* (United Nations, New York and Geneva, 2007), p. 107 (**Exh. RLA-086**).\n\n181.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has reached its decision irrespective of these writings, which merely rely on the authors' reasoning without reference to extrinsic materials, it notes that all the authorities support the conclusion it adopted on the basis of the text and context. It also notes that the Claimant failed to submit any authority leading to another conclusion.236\n\nWhen asked by a member of the Tribunal whether the Claimant could provide any authority for its interpretation that Article XI(4)(a) is a mere administrative formality, it simply answered that it found nothing that supported its interpretation \"other than the logic of our submissions\" (Tr. 14052013, 58:2-59:5).\n\n182.\n\nThe Parties have also relied in varying degrees on the treaty practice of Indonesia and Australia. Treaties on the same subject matter concluded respectively by Australia and Indonesia with third States can legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary means of interpretation. For instance, in *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ had recourse to treaties on the same subject-matter concluded by one disputing party with third States.237 This approach also found resonance in investment treaty arbitration, for example in *AAPL*238 or in *Plama.*239\n\n*Oil Platforms* (*Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America*), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1996 (\" *Oil Platforms* \"), \u00b6\u00b6 29, 47. *See also* Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1952, pp. 191-192 (**Exh.

CLA-130**).\n\n183.\n\nPrior to the hearing, the Parties had filed a selection of BITs of either Australia or Indonesia and third parties. To gain a complete view of potential treaty patterns for its decision, the Tribunal drew up a tentative table containing the dispute settlement clauses entered into by Australia and Indonesia with third parties. It circulated that table for the Parties' comments in two rounds of post-hearing submissions.\n\n184.\n\nIn analyzing these treaties, the Tribunal does not mean to make any finding on the existence of consent to arbitration in the third party treaties. It limits itself to a *prima facie* analysis of such treaties and expresses an opinion on the Australia-Indonesia BIT only.\n\n185.\n\nThe information on record shows that Indonesia signed 64 BITs, 49 of which are in force.240 The tables provided by the Parties in response to the Tribunal's listings show 25 different formulations indicating Indonesia's advance consent to international arbitration.241\n\nIn its first post-hearing brief, Churchill provided the Tribunal with a list of 58 BITs concluded by Indonesia, out of which 50 are publicly available. In addition, Churchill referred to the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area. *Cf.* C-PHB1, Annex 1. Indonesia provided the Tribunal, together with its first post-hearing brief, with a list of 64 BITs, including the text of all investor-State dispute settlement clauses. (**Exh. R-111**).\n\nThe various formulations are as follows: \"hereby consents to submit\" (Indonesia-Turkmenistan BIT, Art. VIII(3); Indonesia-Sweden BIT, Art. 8(1); Indonesia-Netherlands BIT, Art.

VIII(2)(c)); \"irrevocably consents in advance\" (Indonesia-Croatia BIT, Art. 10(2); the BIT is not in force); \"agrees in advance and irrevocably\" (Indonesia-Libya BIT, Art. 12(4); Indonesia-Serbia BIT, Art. 11(4); these BITs are not in force); \"the investor may refer\" (Indonesia-Malaysia, Art. VII(2)); \"the investor may submit\" (Indonesia-Chile BIT, Art. IX(2); the BIT is not in force); \"the investor affected may submit\" (Indonesia-South Korea BIT, Art. 9(2)); \"the investor concerned may submit\" (Indonesia-Bulgaria BIT, Art.

VIII(3); Indonesia-India BIT, Art. 9(3); Indonesia-North Korea BIT, Art. 8(3); the latter not being in force); \"the dispute may be submitted\" (Indonesia-Spain BIT, Art. X(2)); \"the dispute can be submitted\" (Indonesia-Morocco BIT, Art. VIII(2); Indonesia-Turkey BIT, Art. VIII(2)); \"the dispute shall, at the request of the investor be submitted\" (Indonesia-Iran BIT, Art. 11(2)); \"the dispute shall, at the request of the investor concerned, be submitted\" (Indonesia-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 8(2); Indonesia-Mozambique BIT, Art. VII(2); Indonesia-Philippines BIT, Art. 8(2); the latter not being in force); \"the dispute shall, at the request of the investor of the other Contracting Party, be submitted\" (Indonesia-Germany BIT, Art. 10(2)); \"the dispute shall be submitted\" (Indonesia-Argentina BIT, Art. 10(3); Indonesia-Jamaica BIT, Art. IX(5); Indonesia-Guyana BIT, Art. 9(5); the latter two not being in force); \"it may be submitted\" (Indonesia-China BIT, Art.

IX(2)); and \"either party to the dispute may institute\" (Indonesia-Tunisia BIT, Art. 10(2)).\n\n186.\n\nThe tables also show that in at least 60 out of 64 BITs, Indonesia has given advance consent.242 These 60 BITs do not include the Australia-Indonesia BIT in dispute in the present proceeding, nor the BIT Indonesia concluded with the United Kingdom which contains the wording \"shall assent to any request\", a provision relevant for Churchill in ICSID arbitration ARB/12/14. They do not include the Indonesia-France BIT either, which mandates the inclusion of consent in the investment approval documentation.243 The only BIT entered into by Indonesia and still in force, which unequivocally lacks a standing offer to arbitrate, is the Indonesia-Switzerland BIT containing no investor-State dispute settlement provision at all.\n\nIt is to be noted that 15 out of these 60 BITs have not entered into force.\n\nIndonesia-France BIT, Art. 3 *cum* Art. 2.\n\n187.\n\nThe tables finally show that since the early 1990s Indonesia has followed a policy of securing access to international arbitration for investors. The only instance since 1990 where it has not done so is the Australia-Indonesia BIT.\n\n188.\n\nA look at Australia's treaty practice shows that the wording of the dispute settlement clause in that latter treaty must have been proposed by the Australian negotiators. Since 1988, Australia signed 23 BITs, all of which are presently in force. They all contain investor-State dispute settlement clauses providing (at least partially) for international arbitration. Australia has a clear preference for ICSID, since only the Australia-Hong Kong BIT does not mention ICSID, providing instead for UNCITRAL arbitration.244 The Australia-China BIT provides direct access to international arbitration only for several specific claims,245 while the Australia-Poland and Australia-Hungary BITs make the exhaustion of local remedies a prerequisite for international arbitration.246 Three BITs contain an unequivocal expression of consent to ICSID proceedings,247 and another allows the investor to choose between various mechanisms, including ICSID and the Additional Facility mechanism in case one Contracting State is not an ICSID member.248\n\nAustralia-Hong Kong BIT, Art. 10.\n\nAustralia-China BIT, Art. XII(2)(b). Under this provision, a qualifying investor can only directly seek redress in front of an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex A of the treaty if the dispute relates to the amount of compensation in cases of expropriation. For all other claims, the disputing parties need to agree on the dispute settlement mechanism. Interestingly, Art. XII(4) indicates that once both Contracting States become ICSID members, a qualifying investor may refer any dispute to ICSID.\n\nAustralia-Poland BIT, Art. 13(4) and Australia-Hungary BIT, Art. 12(4). This requirement does not apply to expropriation claims under Article 7 of these treaties, see respectively Australia-Poland BIT, Art. 13(3) and Australia-Hungary BIT, Art. 12(3).\n\nAustralia-Argentina BIT, Art. 13(4) (\"Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice made by the investor under paragraph 3(a) or (b) of this Article\"); Australia-Chile BIT, Art. 11(2)(a)(i) (\"en este caso, cada Parte Contractante por este intermedio otorga su consentimiento previo para someter la diferencia al CIADI\"); Australia-Turkey BIT, Art. 13(5)(a) (\"Where a dispute is referred to the Centre by an investor pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of this Article: (a) the other Party shall, for the purposes of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, be deemed to have given its consent to the submission of the dispute to the Centre\").\n\nAustralia-Mexico BIT, Art. 13(4).\n\n189.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2002, Australia concluded 12 BITs containing a dispute settlement clause similar to the one of the Treaty with Indonesia, suggesting that this wording corresponds to one of the model clauses employed by the Australian BIT negotiators. These BITs all follow the same basic model providing the investor with a choice between domestic litigation in the host State and ICSID proceedings, to the exclusion of other international remedies as long as both Contracting States are ICSID members. Most of these BITs also indicate that the requested host State \"shall consent in writing\" within 30249 or 45 days.250\n\nAustralia-Romania BIT, Art. 9(3)(a); Australia-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 11(3)(a); Australia-Laos BIT, Art. 12(3)(a); Australia-Pakistan BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Peru BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Lithuania BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Egypt BIT, Art. 13(3)(a); Australia-Uruguay BIT, Art. 13(3)(a).\n\nAustralia-Philippines BIT, Art. 12(3)(a).\n\n190.\n\nA chronological perusal of these treaties provides some clarity. The first BIT that employs similar language is the Australia-Papua New Guinea BIT concluded in 1990. Interestingly, this BIT contains no reference to a time limit, nor does it specify that the host State's consent must be in writing.251 The \"shall consent in writing\" language with a time limit was first employed in the following two treaties with Poland and Hungary. In these two BITs, as well as in the treaties with the Czech Republic,252 the time limit was included in the same paragraph as the one providing for ICSID proceedings. All BITs concluded subsequently by Australia and falling within this category provide for the obligation to provide \"consent in writing\" in a separate paragraph. The fourth BIT falling in this category is the Australia-Indonesia BIT under scrutiny. The following seven BITs concluded until 2002 contain language that is identical to that of the Australia-Indonesia BIT (with some minor variations as to the choice of the default procedures253 or the time limit).254 Finally, the Australia-Uruguay BIT, which entered into force on 12 December 2012, is the last treaty containing the wording \"shall consent in writing\" within a specified time limit. However, this treaty adopts another structure giving an investor access to the alternative arbitration mechanism even where both Contracting States are ICSID mem bers.255\n\nAustralia-Papua New Guinea BIT, Art. 14(3)(a) (\"Where a dispute is referred to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(b) of this Article: (a) each Contracting Party shall consent to the submission of that dispute to the Centre\").\n\nAustralia-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 11(3)(a).\n\nThe Australia-Romania, Australia-Laos, Australia-Philippines, Australia-Pakistan, Australia-Peru, and Australia-Lithuania BITs provide for an arbitral mechanism specified in the relevant treaty or an annex thereto. Only the Australia-Indonesia BIT provides for UNCITRAL arbitration as the default procedure, while the Australia-Egypt BIT allows a qualifying investor to choose as the default procedure between referring the dispute to the arbitral mechanism specified in Annex B of the treaty or to the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration.\n\n*See* reference *supra* notes 249 and 250.\n\nAustralia-Uruguay BIT, Art. 13(2).\n\n191.\n\nThe last two remaining BITs have particularly caught the attention of the Tribunal. Article 12 of the Australia-Vietnam BIT contains a dispute settlement clause which is similar in several respects to the one of the Australia-Indonesia BIT, but differs in other important respects. The relevant provisions of Article 12 read as follows:\n\n\"(2) If the dispute in question cannot be resolved through consultations and negotiations, either party to the dispute may:\n\n(a) in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment, initiate proceedings before that Contracting Party's competent judicial or administrative bodies;\n\n(b) if both Contracting Parties are at that time party to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the Convention\"), refer the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\") for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Articles 28 or 36 of the Convention;\n\n(c) if both Contracting Parties are not at that time party to the Convention, or one party to the dispute has not consented to referring the dispute to the Centre, refer the dispute to an Arbitral Tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex B of this Agreement, or by agreement, to any other arbitral authority.\n\n(3) Once an action referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article has been taken, neither Contracting Party shall pursue the dispute through diplomatic channels unless:\n\n(a) the relevant judicial or administrative body, the Secretary-General of the Centre, the arbitral authority or tribunal or the conciliation commission, as the case may be, has decided that it has no jurisdiction in relation to the dispute in question; or\n\n(b) the other Contracting Party has failed to abide by or comply with any judgment, award, order or other determination made by the body in question\".256\n\nAustralia-Vietnam BIT, Art. 12(2)-(3), pp. 135-137 (**Exh. R-111**).\n\n192.\n\nThe words \"or one party to the dispute has not consented to referring the dispute to the Centre\" in Article 12(2)(c) show that Australia contemplates refusing to grant consent. Planet's argument that these words only refer to the foreign investor refusing to give its consent is contradicted by the clear text. Interestingly, this treaty was concluded in 1991 shortly before the Australia-Indonesia BIT, which demonstrates that at that time Australia had a clear understanding of the difference between advance consent and a promise to consent.\n\n193.\n\nA similar solution is contemplated in Article 13 of the Australia-Sri Lanka BIT257 signed on 12 November 2002 and entered into force on 14 March 2007:\n\n\"(2) If the dispute in question cannot be resolved through consultations and negotiations within 90 days of the commencement of such consultations and negotiations, either party to the dispute may:\n\n(a) in accordance with the law of the Party which admitted the investment, initiate proceedings before that Party's competent judicial or administrative bodies; or\n\n(b) if both Parties are at that time party to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the Convention\"), refer the dispute to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\") for conciliation or arbitration pursuant to Articles 28 or 36 of the Convention; or\n\n(c) if both Parties are not at that time party to the Convention, refer the dispute to an Arbitral Tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex B of this Agreement, or by agreement, to any other arbitral authority.\n\n(3) Where a dispute is referred to the Centre pursuant to paragraph 2(b) of this Article:\n\n(a) where that action is taken by an investor of one Party, the other Party should consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days of receiving such a request from the investor.\n\nSuch consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;\n\n(b) if the parties to the dispute cannot agree whether conciliation or arbitration is the more appropriate procedure, the investor affected shall have the right to choose;\n\n[...]\n\n(4) If the Party to the dispute has not consented to submission of the dispute to the Centre within the time specified in paragraph 3(a) of this Article the Party shall be deemed to have consented to refer the dispute to an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with Annex B of this Agreement\".258\n\nIndonesia called the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that Australia announced in 2011 that it would no longer conclude investor-State arbitration provisions in its future investment treaties; R-PHB2, n. 53 (**Exh. CLA-111**).\n\nAustralia-Sri Lanka BIT, Art. 13(2)-(4) (**Exh. RLA-092**).\n\n194.\n\nContrary to the Australia-Indonesia BIT, Article 13(3)(a) states that the host State *should* consent to the submission of the dispute to ICSID and that such consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld\". It also makes the default procedure available where consent is withheld. In other words, the treaty expressly envisages that the host State may refuse its consent.\n\n195.\n\nThese last two treaties show that Australia deliberately entertains the distinction between advance consent and promise to consent. The foregoing review also demonstrates that Australia concluded BITs with unequivocal expressions of advance consent and thus knows how to express such an intent when it wishes to do so. Hence, the Tribunal is of the opinion that a review of Australia's treaty practice supports the conclusion it reached earlier, *i.e.* that the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains a promise to consent.\n\n196.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that the recent decision on provisional measures in *Tethyan Copper v. Pakistan* is of no assistance here.259 That arbitration is brought under Article 13(3)(a) of the Australia-Pakistan BIT, which provides that the host State \"shall consent in writing to the submission of the dispute to the Centre within thirty days\". The tribunal found that it had *prima facie* jurisdiction since both Parties consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID in accordance with Article 25(1).260 In addition to being a *prima facie* determination, it appears that Pakistan did not object to jurisdiction for purposes of the provisional measures on the grounds of lack of consent,261 and it is not known whether it provided its consent within the 45 days or whether another expression of consent applies.\n\n*Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1, Decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, 13 December 2012 (**Exh. CLA-159**).\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 129.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 85.\n\n197.\n\nFinally, Planet's reliance on various National Interest Analyses (NIAs) prepared since 1996 by the Australian Government in conjunction with proposed new bilateral investment treaties is to no avail in this regard. Indeed, the Tribunal is of the opinion that they are of little help in the present context. First, they all post-date the entry into force of the Australia-Indonesia BIT. Second, the NIAs do not purport to opine on the existence of consent or the modalities of providing consent under the relevant BITs, but merely indicate in a section on costs that the Australian Government may be at risk of assuming costs related to an ICSID arbitration.262 Accordingly, the Tribunal did not rely on these NIAs.\n\n*See*, for instance, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Agreement between Australia and the Government of the Republic of Peru on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, and Protocol, done at Lima on 7 December 1995 - National Interest Analysis (**Exh. CLA-154**).\n\n198.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal holds that Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains no standing offer to arbitrate Planet's claims before ICSID. Planet is therefore only entitled to resort to ICSID arbitration if Indonesia's consent was given through a further act. This leads the Tribunal to review whether the BKPM approvals can be construed as containing Indonesia's separate consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n3.4 Do the BKPM Approvals contain Indonesia's consent?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimant argued that if the Tribunal were to find that the BIT contains no standing consent to ICSID proceedings, such consent in writing has been provided by Indonesia in the BKPM Approvals of 2005 and 2006. Indonesia essentially objected that (i) the BIT only contemplates the possibility to grant consent after the filing of a request of arbitration, (ii) that the BKPM lacks authority to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, (iii) that the word *bersedia* in Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval merely denotes a willingness to consider ICSID procedures, not consent, and (iv) that Section IX(4) only extends to PT ICD and not its shareholders.\n\n200.\n\nHaving determined that the BIT requires a separate act of consent, the Tribunal will first address whether the BIT requires that such consent be necessarily provided after the filing of a request of arbitration, as argued by Indonesia, or whether it can also be provided in advance, as submitted by Planet. For Indonesia, Article XI(4)(a) contemplates a two-step procedure, requiring the investor to first file its request for arbitration, and only then could the host State give its consent.\n\n201.\n\nPursuant to Article XI(4)(a), Indonesia agreed to provide its consent in writing within 45 days from receiving the Claimant's request for arbitration. Indonesia's argument that it has discretion to withhold its consent, in particular if the admission requirement of Article III(1) is not fulfilled, is refuted by the wording of Article XI(4)(a). The use of the word \"shall\" without a stated exception leaves no doubt that Indonesia was obliged to grant its consent. Further, Article XI contains no link to Article III(1) (or any other provision of the Treaty for that matter), nor does Article III(1) refer to Article XI. While Indonesia's objection under Article III(1) may eventually be well-founded, it is not for Indonesia to make that determination at the level of its consent under Article XI(4)(a), but for this Tribunal ruling on its jurisdiction.\n\n202.\n\nFurthermore, the wording of Article XI(4)(a) does not exclude the possibility of providing consent in writing prior to the request for arbitration. The Tribunal understands the 45 day time limit of Article XI(4)(a) as precisely a limit indicating the latest time when consent is due. One cannot read into Article XI(4)(a) a prohibition of advance consent or *a fortiori* to refuse jurisdiction in cases where the advance consent of the host State is established. What matters is not when the State has given its consent, but whether the State *did* consent.\n\n203.\n\nHaving determined that consent in writing provided prior to the filing of the request for arbitration is compatible with Article XI(4)(a), the Tribunal will now examine whether the BKPM Approvals contain an expression of consent to ICSID arbitration. The Parties provided slightly different unofficial translations of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval. The Claimant's version reads as follows:\n\n\"In the event of a dispute between the company and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia that cannot be resolved by consensus, the Government of Indonesia [is] *willing to follow* the settlement according to the provisions of the Convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign Citizen regarding investments in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968\".263 (Emphasis added)\n\n**Exh. P-3**. The Claimant also relied on two other exhibits containing a translation of this clause, *see* **Exh. C-6**, and **Exh. C-17** in the parallel case. The translations are identical in all three versions.\n\n204.\n\nIndonesia's version reads:\n\n\"In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia *is prepared/ready to follow* settlement according to the provisions of the convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign Citizen regarding investments in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968\".264 (Emphasis added)\n\n**Exh. R-003**\n\n205.\n\nIn its original wording, Section IX(4) reads as follows:\n\n\"Dalam hal terjadi perselisihan antara perusahaan dengan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia yang tidak dapat diselesaikan secara musyawarah, Pemerintah Indonesia bersedia mengikuti penyelesaian menurut ketentuan konvensi tentang penyelesaian perselisihan antara Negara dan Warga Negara Asing mengenai penanaman modal sesuai dengan Undang-undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1968\".\n\n206.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the Claimant argued that the word *perusahaan* is correctly translated as \"enterprise\", not as \"company\". The Parties were also in disagreement on the meaning of the word *bersedia*, the Claimant seeing in it an expression of consent, the Respondent merely a disposition to envisage following ICSID procedures.265\n\nTr. 14052013, 137:16-138:2.\n\n207.\n\nThe 2005 BKPM Approval was granted to the founders of PT ICD, *i.e.* to Mr. Rinaldi, an Indonesian national, and Profit Point Group Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.266 Following the acquisition of PT ICD by Churchill and Planet on 24 April 2006, the BKPM issued on 8 May 2006 a new approval incorporating the content of the 2005 approval.267\n\n**Exh. C-6**, point I.\n\n**Exh. C-7** (\"This Approval Letter is part and inseparable of Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/IIPMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005\").\n\n208.\n\nSection IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval must be considered to contain an expression of consent to ICSID arbitration. The disagreement between the Parties on the correct translation of the word *bersedia* is irrelevant, since even the formulation \"is [ready/prepared/willing] to follow settlement according to the provisions\" of ICSID expresses consent to submit disputes to ICSID. During cross-examination, the Claimant's expert convincingly explained that the expression *bersedia mengikuti* is an act of consent:\n\n\"DR. MAKARIM: After \u2018bersedia' comes the word \u2018mengikuti'. \u2018Mengikuti', in my mind, refers to something that exists, that is already there, which is the dispute settlement between the convention - the provisions of the convention of dispute settlement\n\nQ. Thank you. My understanding is that \u2018mengikuti' - and I don't know how to speak Indonesian, but my understanding is it is properly translated as \u2018to follow'.\n\nDR. MAKARIM: Yes.\n\nQ. That's it.\n\nDR. MAKARIM: I know. But to follow means - what do you follow? You don't follow at random. It is the convention rules\".268\n\nTr. 13502013, 80:6-19. The translation of the word *mengikuti* as \"to follow\" is confirmed when consulting English-Indonesian dictionaries. *See* J. Echols, H. Shadily, *Kamus Indonesia-Inggris: An Indonesian-English Dictionary*, 3rd edition (*Jakarta, Penerbit PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama,* 1989), p. 219 (**Exh. CLA-141**). *Mengikuti* is translated as follows: \"1 follow, accompany. *Saya ~ anak saya* I accompanied my son. 2 take, follow a course. *Ia ~ beberapa kuliah ttg fisika* He attended several lectures on physics. 3 follow a trail. 4 obey. ~ *perintah ayah* follow father's instructions. 5 keep up with (news, etc.). 6 be part of the audience of s.t. - *upacara* participate in a ceremony\". Indonesia did not provide any dictionary translation of the word *mengikuti* rebutting the dictionary translation provided by the Claimant.\n\n209.\n\nIndonesia's argument that the formulation *bersedia mengikuti* merely indicates the BKPM's willingness or preparedness or readiness to bring a hypothetical dispute to the attention of the President of Indonesia and ask him to grant Indonesia's consent to ICSID proceedings does not reflect the content of Section IX(4). There is no mention of the BKPM or the Presidency in Section IX(4), but of the Government of Indonesia which expresses its willingness \"to follow settlement according to the provisions\" of the ICSID Convention. If Indonesia is ready (or prepared, or willing) to settle the dispute according to the provisions of the ICSID Convention, then it can only mean that Indonesia consented to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n210.\n\nHaving determined that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains Indonesia's expression of consent to ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal must now determine whether this consent extends only to PT ICD, as argued by Indonesia, or also to its shareholders, as advanced by Planet.\n\n211.\n\nThe Parties' divergence on this issue hinges on the translation of the word *perusahaan*. While both Parties filed unofficial translations of the 2005 BKPM Approval translating *perusahaan* as \"company\",269 the Claimant argued during the hearing and in its later submissions that the word *perusahaan* must be translated as \"enterprise\".270 To substantiate its position, the Claimant relied on a dictionary definition of *perusahaan*, which lists \"business, enterprise, undertaking, concern\"271 and on *Amco v. Indonesia*. The tribunal there relied on the same definition as the Claimant here and stressed that the term \"company\" is not listed as a possible translation of *perusahaan*.272 The Claimant also highlighted that the 2005 BKPM Approval utilizes both terms *perusahaan* and *perseroan*, the latter being correctly translated as \"company\". On this basis, it argued that the term *perseroan* would have been used if only PT ICD were to benefit from Section IX(4).273 As a result, the Claimant contended that Section IX(4) extends to PT ICD's shareholders, a position rejected by the Respondent.274\n\n**Exh. C-6**; **Exh. R-003**.\n\nTr. 14052013, 65:23-66:14; C-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\n**Exh. CLA-141**, p. 607.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Award on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, \u00b6 20 (\" *Amco\")*(**Exh. CLA-38**).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 22 (\"Sections of the 2005 BKPM Approval that do concern only PT ICD *qua* company, such as those that refer to corporate capital, issued capital, and paid-up capital employ the term *perseroan* \", referring to sections VII(3) and (4) of the approval).\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 10-18.\n\n212.\n\nSeveral elements lead the Tribunal to conclude that Section IX(4) extends to PT ICD's shareholders. First, the dictionary on record does not translate *perusahaan* as company or corporation, but gives it the broader meaning of business or enterprise.275 It is also noteworthy that PT ICD is a *perseroan terbatas*, that is a limited liability company, further underlining that the word *perusahaan* may have a broader meaning. Second, the 2005 BKPM Approval employs the word *perusahaan* thirteen times in various contexts,276 while the word *perseroan* appears twice, each time in the context of PT ICD's corporate capital.277 This suggests that the word *perseroan* is employed in matters relating exclusively to the corporate vehicle, such as the composition of the corporate capital, and that the word *perusahaan* designates the enterprise including its shareholders. Third, a review of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law also indicates that the word *perseroan* is employed when the corporation is targeted exclusively278 and that *perusahaan* is broad enough to encompass the shareholders. For instance, Article 1 refers to the direct foreign capital investment to be used to run the *perusahaan*, whereby \"the owner of the capital directly bears the risk of the investment\".279 While the word *perusahaan* is used in various contexts, the word *perseroan* only appears in the context of corporate tax exemptions, again suggesting that *perseroan* is employed for matters limited to the corporation. Fourth, the Tribunal finds further support for its understanding in the 2006 BKPM Approval, which allowed PT ICD to become wholly owned by foreign investors. While the word *perseroan* is again used in connection with PT ICD's corporate capital, the word *perusahaan* is employed in the context of the obligation to sell shares of PT ICD to Indonesian nationals within 15 years from the start of commercial operations.280 It is clear that this requirement affects primarily PT ICD's shareholders whose rights of ownership are directly at stake.\n\n**Exh. CLA-141**, p. 607. The Respondent only provided the Tribunal with a dictionary definition in Indonesian language of the term *perusahaan,* thus not allowing the Tribunal to elucidate the proper translation of that term in English (*see* **Exh. RLA-117**).\n\n*See, e.g,* Sections II(1), IV(1) and (3), VI, VII(5), IX(1)-(5).\n\n*See* Section VII (3) and (4).\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 15(a)(1) and (3), and 15(b)(1) (**Exh. CLA-2**; **Exh. RLA-006**).\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 1 (**Exh. CLA-2**; **Exh. RLA-006**).\n\n**Exh. C-7**, point d.\n\n213.\n\nBeyond the words, what is further determinative is that PT ICD is a mere instrumentality of foreign investors, who have no choice but to structure their investment through a local vehicle.281 The whole purpose of the 2005 BKPM Approval is precisely to approve a foreign investment. In this context, and relying on *Amco Asia*,282 it makes sense that Section IX(4) was meant to protect the foreign investor, constrained to act through its instrumentality. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval extends to the parent companies of PT ICD. Since the 2006 BKPM Approval expressly incorporates the terms of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Tribunal is of the view that Section IX(4) extends to Planet.\n\n*See* Art. 3(1) of Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2**; **Exh. RLA-006**).\n\n*Amco,* \u00b6 24.\n\n214.\n\nHaving found that the BKPM Approvals express consent which is applicable to Planet, the Tribunal must now deal with Indonesia's last argument according to which the BKPM lacks authority to grant consent to ICSID proceedings, since this prerogative rests with the Presidency. Indonesia's contention is based on Law No. 5 of 1968 on the approval to the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"[t]he Government has the authority to give consent\" to ICSID283 and on Article 4(1) of Indonesia's Constitution pursuant to which the President holds the \"power of governance\".284\n\n**Exh. RLA-064**, Art. 2.\n\n**Exh. RLA-001** (revised version filed together with R-PHB1).\n\n215.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Indonesia's argumentation is founded on an excessively narrow reading of the provisions just referred to. Indeed, the Government of Indonesia cannot be reduced to the Presidency and several texts demonstrate that the BKPM is part of the Government. According to Article 1 of Presidential Decree No. 33 of 1981, the BKPM is a \"Non Departmental Government Institution under and accountable directly to the President\".285 Article 1(2) of Presidential Decree No. 29 of 2004 further states that the BKPM is a \"Government institution which handles capital investment activities within the framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment\".286 This decree specifies that BKPM's activities include the implementation of capital investment policies and development planning, promotion and cooperation, approvals, permits and facilities, control, and management of information systems. BKPM being a government body vested with authority to handle foreign investments, there can be no doubt that it has the power to grant consent to ICSID arbitration under Law No.5 of 1968.\n\n**Exh. C-366**.\n\n**Exh. C-361**.\n\n216.\n\nThis understanding is reinforced by the fact that the 2005 BKPM Approval was copied to the Presidency along with numerous ministries and agencies. Had the President deemed that the BKPM had overstepped its authority, then he would or should have intervened to rectify such mistake. Having failed to do so, Indonesia cannot now argue that the BKPM lacked authority to grant consent to ICSID proceedings.\n\n217.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval contains an expression of consent to ICSID proceedings and that the consent extends to PT ICD's shareholders, *i.e.* in the present case Planet. Since Section IX(4) is contained in an investment approval, it fulfills the requirement of consent *in writing* under Article XI(4)(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n218.\n\nIn light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that Article XI of the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains no standing offer to arbitrate before ICSID, but that the BKPM Approvals fulfill the requirement of consent in writing under Article XI of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Hence, it must dismiss Indonesia's first jurisdictional objection.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal will now assess whether Indonesia's consent extends to Planet's investment in light of Indonesia's second objection under Article III(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n**C. SECOND OBJECTION: THE CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENTS ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nIndonesia submits two related arguments with regard to the admission requirement. First, Indonesia contends that it legitimately withheld its consent because the BIT expressly limits its scope to investments having been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. Second, Indonesia submits that, even if *arguendo* the Tribunal were to find that Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration as a general matter, the Tribunal would still lack jurisdiction because the Claimant's investments fall outside the scope of protected investments under the BIT.\n\n1.1 The investments fall outside the scope of Article III(1) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nArticle III(1) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT provides that the Treaty shall only apply to those investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.287 According to Indonesia, this \"admitted investments\" clause limits the scope of protected investments under the BIT, even if the Tribunal were to find that Indonesia gave its consent to ICSID arbitration.288 In this case, Indonesia contends that Planet must be denied protection because it has not been granted admission pursuant to the 1967 law or any law amending or replacing it.\n\n**Exh. R-001**.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 218.\n\n1.2 The stringent threshold requirement of the \"admitted investments\" clause\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nFor the Respondent, the admission clause is very important for developing countries such as Indonesia, as it allows them to screen foreign investments and thereby safeguard their strategic natural resources.289 Its primary effect is to condition \"the extension of treaty protections on prior approval of specified investments\".290\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 218.\n\n223.\n\nRelying on *Mytilineos v. Serbia and Montenegro*, Indonesia argues that Article III(1) sets a higher standard than more conventional legality clauses.291 Indonesia therefore invites the Tribunal to follow other arbitral tribunals and to dismiss Planet's case *ab initio*.292\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 218.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 220.\n\n1.3 The investments have not been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent highlighted the fact that the BKPM did not have the opportunity to review PT ICD's articles of association before granting its approval on 23 November 2005, although the Respondent acknowledged that PT ICD was granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law and that the BKPM approved the Claimant's acquisition of PT ICD in 2006.293\n\nTr. 13052013, 24:25 ff., esp. 33:4-34:8; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 86-88; RMOJ, \u00b6 48 (\"On 23 November 2005, PT ICD received an approval from BKPM to be a *Penanaman Modal Asing* (PMA - foreign direct investment) company, operating as a *Perseroan Terbatas* (PT - limited liability company)\").\n\n225.\n\nIndonesia interprets the admission requirement not as a threshold whereby once admission has been granted the requirement is fulfilled, but as a continuous process whereby a foreign investor violates the admission requirement when engaging in activities that are not covered by the terms of the BKPM approval.294 In particular, the Respondent argues that (i) by entering into a series of agreements,295 especially by concluding the Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership,296 the Claimant violated Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law; and (ii) by engaging in mining activities and not confining itself to providing mining services, the Claimant violated the terms of its admission.297\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 69 (\"Investors must also remain in compliance with the terms of their admission as reflected in their approvals in order to remain admitted in Indonesia and to continue benefiting from protections afforded under the respective BITs\").\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 237.\n\nDeed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between (1) PT Ridlatama Steel, PT Ridlatama Power, PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral, PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo and PT Techno Coal Utama Prima and (2) PT Indonesia Coal Development dated 22 May 2007 (**Exh. P-17**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.\n\n226.\n\nIn connection with the first argument, the Respondent seeks to rebut the Claimant's submission that the Bupati of East Kutai authorized it to enter into legal relationships with the Ridlatama companies.298 According to the Respondent, the Bupati's authorization was given on condition of abiding with prevailing laws, which the Claimant did not do because it engaged in mining activities.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 241.\n\n227.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent expanded during the hearing on what it called \"indications of forgery\" in its previous submissions.299 It argued that there were many irregularities in certain important documents submitted by the Claimant, including the KP Exploration Licenses and the maps annexed thereto.300 Asked to elucidate the link between the forgery accusations and its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent answered as follows:\n\n\"[Tribunal:] Before that, what is the link between this issue and your jurisdictional objection?\n\n[Respondent:] This is basically to show that there is no interest whatsoever that the claimant has with respect to the substance matter, that is, the revocations of KP\".301\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 81-102.\n\nTr. 13052013, 212:14-233:19.\n\nTr. 13052013, 222:12-17.\n\n228.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's second argument related to mining activities, the Respondent states that Planet, through Churchill, announced on 5 April 2007 and 23 May 2007 that they made a promising coal discovery, 95% of which being situated in the PT RTM block.302 Stressing that PT RTM allegedly received a mining undertaking license for general survey on 24 May 2007 only, that is after the announcements, the Respondent contends that \"Churchill [and therefore also Planet] and/or PT RTM and/or PT RTP illegally undertook such mining survey activities as drilling in the areas for which they did not hold a license\".303\n\n**Exh. R-013** and **Exh. R-014**.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 58.\n\n1.4 PT ICD's business field only covers mining support services\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nIndonesia acknowledges that the Claimant's investments took the form of ownership of PT ICD, a local subsidiary, which received approval to operate as a foreign direct investment company under Indonesian law.304 However, PT ICD's business field was described in the 2005 BKPM Approval as \"General Mining Support Services\".305 Similarly, PT ICD's Articles of Association define the company's \"objective and purpose\" as \"business of geological and mining services\".306\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 222.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n230.\n\nIn support of this argument, the Respondent confronted Dr. Makarim in cross-examination with one of his articles published in the Jakarta Post.307 In this article, referring to PMA companies in general and not to PT ICD in particular, Dr. Makarim had expressed the following opinion:\n\n\"Also, the company's articles of association must have contained Objectives and Purposes clauses which would most likely limit its activities to mining services, not mining activities. [...] Conducting activities that may be constructed as mining would be beyond its corporate authorisation and therefore susceptible to nullification actions\".308\n\n**Exh. R-101**.\n\nTr. 13052013, 36:11-18.\n\n231.\n\nOn that basis, the Respondent argues that \"in order to achieve that purpose and objective, and of course if the activity [\u2026] is interpreted that it is a mining activities [sic], it will be illogical that you can do mining activities to achieve the purpose of objective of undertaking mining supporting services\".309\n\nTr. 13052013, 186:17-24.\n\n1.5 The Claimant could only engage in mining activities by concluding a contract of work or a coal cooperation agreement (PKP2B) with the Indonesian Government\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nUnder the 1967 Mining Law and the 1980 Regulation No. 27 on Categorization of Extractive Materials, coal is classified as a strategic natural resource regulated through a multi-step application process for obtaining mining authorizations.\n\n233.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant could only engage in mining activities such as exploitation of a mining site by obtaining a PKP2B - a so-called coal cooperation agreement - which the Claimant should have concluded with the Government.310 However, neither PT ICD, nor the Claimant, nor PT TCUP in which the Claimant acquired a majority in 2010, ever applied for a PKP2B.311\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 228.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 230, 238.\n\n234.\n\nSpecifically, under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors can only engage in the field of mining on the basis of direct cooperation with the Government. Article 8(1) of this act provides that \"[f]oreign capital investment in the field of mining shall be based on a cooperation with the Government on the basis of a contract of work (\u2018 *kontrak karya* ') or other form in accordance with applicable laws and regulations\".312\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 8(1) (**Exh. CLA-2** ; **Exh. RLA-006**).\n\n235.\n\nUnder Article 1(1) of the 2004 Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 1614,313 the contract of work just referred to is defined as \"an agreement between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia with Indonesian legal entity company in the framework of Foreign Investment to conduct extractive materials mining undertaking, excluding petroleum, natural gas, geothermal, radio active and coal\".\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; **Exh. RLA-005**, Art. 1(1).\n\n236.\n\nAccording to Article 1(2) of Decree No. 1614, a coal cooperation agreement is an \"agreement between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia with Indonesian legal entity company in the framework of Foreign Investment to conduct extractive material coal mining undertaking\".314\n\n*Id.*, Art. 1(2).\n\n237.\n\nAs mentioned in the Respondent's submission, the Claimant could only have engaged in mining activities (as opposed to mining services) by entering into a PKP2B with the central Government. Under Decree No. 1614 just referred to, the role of the BKPM is merely to forward the foreigner's investment application to the relevant ministries and the President, who must approve the coal cooperation agreement. Article 24 of such decree states that a draft PKP2B \"that has obtained recommendation from BKPM and has been consulted with the House of People's Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia is therefore submitted by the Minister for approval to the President\".315 Once approval has been obtained from the President, Article 25 of Decree No. 1614 directs that the PKP2B must be signed by the Minister \"on behalf of the Government\".316\n\n*Id.*, Art. 24.\n\n*Id*., Art. 25.\n\n238.\n\nIn sum, the BKPM Approvals did not allow PT ICD or Planet to engage in mining activities *per se*. By doing so Planet failed to observe the limits set forth in the BKPM Approvals.317\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 55-58, 63, 226.\n\n1.6 The Claimant circumvented the law by securing beneficial ownership in the Ridlatama licenses\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nIndonesia advances that only Indonesian nationals or companies can obtain KP licenses to engage in mining activities. PMAs such as PT ICD and foreign investors cannot obtain KP licenses.318\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 229.\n\n240.\n\nIndonesia further submits that Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law, promulgated on 26 April 2007319 and replacing the 1967 Foreign Investment Law320 prohibits beneficial ownership by declaring that ownership and benefits associated with it are indivisible.321 Article 33(1) stipulates that \"[d]omestic investor and foreign investor which undertake capital investment in the form of a limited liability company are prohibited from making any agreement and/or statement which confirms that ownership of share(s) in a limited liability company is for and on behalf of other party\". Article 33(2) then declares any such agreement null and void by operation of law.322 For the Respondent, various arrangements entered into by PT ICD on behalf of the Claimant violate Article 33 and are therefore null and void. Therefore, the Claimant should be denied protection under the BITs.\n\nLaw No. 25 on Investment (2007) (**Exh. RLA-009**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 41. Law No. 1 on Foreign Capital Investment (1967) (**Exh. RLA-006**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 236.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 234.\n\n241.\n\nIn this context, Indonesia emphasizes that Dr. Makarim fails to address Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law in his first expert report, but has acknowledged in a recent press article that Indonesian law prohibits arrangements of beneficial ownership.323\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 236; Tr. 13052013, 38:25-40:3. For the Dr. Makarim's article \"*The Risk of Convenient Alternatives\",* The Jakarta Post, 1 August 2012 (**Exh. R-101**).\n\n242.\n\nIndonesia claims that Churchill and Planet, through PT ICD, have entered into a series of arrangements with the Ridlatama companies and their owners which breach the 2007 Investment law by providing beneficial ownership to PT ICD, and thus ultimately to Churchill and Planet. Specifically, it makes the following assertions:324\n\n- The 22 May 2007 Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between PT ICD and PT RS, PT RP, PT RTM, PT RTP and PT TCUP violates Article 33 as it provides for PT ICD's 75% beneficial ownership and control of these companies.325\n\n- The 25 May 2007 agreements (the cooperation agreement, the investors agreement, the pledge of shares agreements, and the powers of attorney) were concluded to allow the Claimant to engage in mining activities going beyond mere mining services and to obtain 75% of the mining revenue. Therefore they violated the 2007 Investment Law.326\n\n- The 28 November 2007 agreements (the second cooperation agreement, the second investor's agreement, the new pledge of shares agreements) also sought to secure PT ICD's benefits accruing from the KP licenses, thus violating the 2007 Investment Law.327\n\n- The March 31, 2008 agreements between PT ICD and PT IR and PT INP as well as with Mmes. Florita and Setiawan also breached the 2007 Investment Law.328\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 237.\n\nDeed of Beneficial Control and Ownership dated 22 May 2007, Art. 4.1 (**Exh.

C-86**) ; Investors Agreement between PT ICD, Investmine Persada, Investama Resources, Ms. Florita and Ms. Ani Setiawan (**Exh. C-90**), both dated 31 March 2008.\n\n243.\n\nIndonesia believes that Planet knew that it was prohibited to own shares in Indonesian companies holding KP licenses, as Article 5.7 of the 25 May 2007 Cooperation Agreement states that \"[i]f there is any change in the law of the Republic of Indonesia which allows ICD to hold TCUP's shares in each of the KP Holders, TCUP and the KP Holders shall provide all necessary assistance. to ensure that such shares are transferred to ICD\".329\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 237, n. 334.\n\n244.\n\nFinally, Indonesia explains that it was not aware of these agreements because the Claimant operated under confidentiality agreements. However, when the Regent of East Kutai became aware in 2009 of the beneficial control exerted by the Claimant, most notably through Churchill's press releases in which it claimed to have become the owner of the EKCP coal reserves, he immediately requested clarification from Churchill and the London Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\").330 The Regent also informed the Claimant that it could not own any interests in Indonesian companies holding KP licenses, and that he had never issued a PKP2B or a KP license to them or to PT ICD or PT TCUP.331\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 238.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n245.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant's interest in PT TCUP cannot find protection under the BIT, so the Respondent submits, because it was obtained after the revocation decrees of 4 May 2010. According to the Respondent, PT TCUP amended its articles of association on 16 April 2010 to authorize a capital increase and issue new shares. That amendment was approved by the Minister of Law and Human Rights on 15 June 2010, and only thereafter did PT ICD obtain a 99.01% direct interest in PT TCUP and Churchill the remaining 0.99%. Planet accordingly had an indirect interest in PT TCUP as a shareholder of PT ICD.\n\n246.\n\nThus, the Claimant is barred from invoking any rights in respect to its interest in PT TCUP as it acquired its interest in PT TCUP when the mining licenses were already revoked.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n2.1 The Claimant's investments have been admitted in accordance with the BIT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nFor the Claimant, Indonesia fails to explain the content of the admission requirement under the BIT and conflates that requirement with the larger legality requirement.332\n\nReply, \u00b6 166. *See also* : Tr. 13052013, 9:7-13.\n\n2.2 The meaning of the \"admission\" requirement\n----------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in ordinary usage and in light of the context in the Australia-Indonesia BIT, the term \"admitted\" means \"allowed\" or \"approved for entry\".333 Therefore, the admission requirement is applicable at the time when making the investment and, once approved, the investment is covered by the BIT.334\n\nReply, \u00b6 167. *See also* : Tr. 14052013, 76:22-24.\n\nReply, \u00b6 168.\n\n249.\n\nTo support its interpretation of the term \"admitted\", the Claimant relies on similarly worded provisions in the Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN FTA335 and the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement.336 The Claimant also relies on *Desert Line Projects v. Yemen*, where the tribunal found that, in the absence of a specifically defined manner of certifying acceptance, a general endorsement of the investment at the highest level of the State satisfies the admission requirement.337 Finally, the Claimant disputes Indonesia's reliance on *Gruslin v. Malaysia* and *Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Myanmar*, because the facts underlying the present dispute are different.338\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171.\n\nReply, \u00b6 172.\n\nReply, \u00b6 174. *Desert Line, supra* note 126, \u00b6\u00b6 92, 98 (**Exh. RLA-061**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's expansive reading of the admission requirement, which it seemingly convolutes with the \"in accordance with the law\" requirement: \"[I]t is our further submission that once this admission is granted, the investment activity can commence within Indonesia without the need for further admissions. Indeed, the whole point of admission is a singular act. If separate admissions were required for all investments subsequently, this would amount to a compliance with law requirement, which has been explicitly distinguished by authorities and also, of course, by a plain meaning of the term\".339\n\nTr. 14052013, 85:1-10. *See also* : Tr. 14052013, 82:6-11.\n\n251.\n\nTherefore, relying on *Hamester v. Ghana*, the Claimant insisted on the distinction between \"legality a[t] the time of the initiation of the investment\" and \"legality during the performance of the investment\",340 the first aspect relating to jurisdiction and the second one to the merits.\n\nTr. 14052013, 80:21-23.\n\n2.3 All investments were granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law and the 2007 Investment Law\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, all of its investments have been established in accordance with the relevant foreign investment laws and granted admission by the competent authorities. PT ICD was granted a BKPM Approval in 2005 and received a Permanent Business License in 2007. After PT ICD's acquisition by Churchill and Planet in 2006, BKPM again granted its approval. All further investment activities also received authorization by the relevant authorities. In support, the Claimant recalls that under both the 1967 Foreign Investment Law341 and the 2007 Investment Law which replaced it,342 the BKPM is the agency with authority to grant admission to foreign investors in Indonesia.343\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh.

CLA-4**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 181; Makarim ER2, p. 5.\n\n253.\n\nRelying on the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant further submits that PT ICD received the authorization to engage in mining activities for a period of 30 years. In that regard, Dr. Makarim points out that \"once the BKPM issued its 2006 Approval and the MEMR issued a Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License, PT ICD was admitted into Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law\".344 Dr. Makarim further states that none of PT ICD's subsequent investment activity required additional approvals to fulfill the admission requirement under the BIT.345\n\nReply, \u00b6 182; Makarim ER2, p. 12.\n\nReply, \u00b6 182; Makarim ER2, p. 7.\n\n254.\n\nIn any event, according to the Claimant, it received all the necessary authorizations and approvals, in particular:\n\n- The 2006 BKPM Approval;\n\n- The 2006 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources;\n\n- The 2007 BKPM Permanent Business License; and\n\n- The 2011 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.346\n\nReply, \u00b6 183.\n\n255.\n\nIn each of these approvals or licenses, PT ICD's foreign shareholding is explicitly mentioned, a clear recognition by Indonesia that these approvals concerned an investment by foreigners.347\n\nReply, \u00b6 184.\n\n256.\n\nIn addition to disputing that it engaged in mining activities *per se* in violation of the relevant mining licenses, the Claimant argues that Indonesia's allegation that it circumvented the law by restructuring the investment - besides being wrong - has no bearing on the fulfillment of the admission requirement.\n\n257.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant disputes that PT ICD could only engage in mining activities in the coal sector by concluding a PKP2B with the Government;348 that PT ICD's mining license only covered mining services in a limited sense;349 that Churchill or Planet engaged in mining activity without permission;350 and that the contractual arrangements with the Ridlatama companies violated Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law.351\n\nReply, \u00b6 188.\n\nReply, \u00b6 190.\n\nReply, \u00b6 189.\n\nReply, \u00b6 191.\n\n2.4 The Claimant's investments have otherwise been made in accordance with Indonesian law\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.4.1 The Australia-Indonesia BIT contains no legality requirement\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimant stresses that Indonesia does not contest that the Australia-Indonesia BIT contains no express legality requirement.352 In the absence of such requirement, the Claimant puts forward that Indonesia \"cannot claim plausibly that any illegality in the Claimant['s] investment, other than lack of proper admission, would deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction\".353 The Claimant also notes that Indonesia has failed to substantiate its position with a single authority, except for references where the definition of investment included a legality requirement.354\n\nReply, \u00b6 197. Reference made to RMOJ, \u00b6 248.\n\nReply, \u00b6 198.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n2.4.2 Planet never performed mining *per se*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimant challenges Indonesia's allegations that it engaged in mining operations without the necessary authorizations. There is no evidence showing what activities qualify as mining services as opposed to actual mining: \"Where in the process from prospecting for coal [...] to the extraction and sale of coal, can it be said that mining services starts or stops; or which activities within the process from start to finish are services as opposed to actual mining?\"355\n\nTr. 14052013, 119:21-120:2.\n\n260.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant denies having performed mining *per se*, save for drilling in conformity with the KP Exploration Licenses granted to the Ridlatama companies.356 At the hearing, it recalled that \"the licenses were revoked when only 20 per cent of the territory [covered by them] had been fully explored. No mine was ever opened. No mine was ever operational. No coal was ever mined from the East Kutai Coal Project\".357\n\nReply, \u00b6 189.\n\nTr. 14052013, 120:11-16.\n\n2.4.3 The Respondent's accusations of document forgery are not supported by evidence\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant strongly rejects the Respondent's accusations raised during the hearing regarding allegedly forged documents in the record. It explains that some document irregularities may be due to clerical errors made by officials in the Regency of East Kutai. Notwithstanding, the fact that the Respondent has not acted on these accusations much earlier is sufficient to rebut them.358\n\nTr. 14052013, 104:18-105:4.\n\n2.4.4 The Respondent's objection could only have a bearing on the merits, not on jurisdiction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nFinally, the Claimant contends that Indonesia's reliance on *World Duty Free v. Kenya* and *Plama v. Bulgaria* is misleading to the extent that its introduction of the legality requirement at the jurisdictional stage conflates jurisdiction with admissibility, which is a merits issue.359 The Tribunal should not refuse to afford Planet a forum to adjudicate its claims. In any event, Indonesia has not reserved admissibility as a preliminary question, which could therefore only affect the merits if at all.\n\nTr. 14052013, 77:20-25.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n263.\n\nHaving determined that Indonesia's expression of consent in the BKPM Approvals satisfies the requirements of Article XI(4)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal must now determine the scope of Indonesia's consent in light of Indonesia's second jurisdictional objection. It must in particular determine whether Planet's investment is covered by the Treaty.\n\n264.\n\nIn light of the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal will first analyze Article III(1)(a) of the Treaty so as to determine the meaning of the words \"granted admission\" (3.1.). Thereafter, it will turn to the Indonesian Foreign Investment Law referred to in Article III(1)(a) of the BIT (3.2.) and to the BKPM Approvals (3.3.).\n\n3.1 The admission requirement under Article III(1)(a) of the BIT\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nArticle III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"1. This Agreement shall apply to:\n\n(a) investments of investors of Australia in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the Law No. 1 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment or with any law amending or replacing it\".360\n\n**Exh. CLA-19**.\n\n266.\n\nIt is common ground that Article III(1) limits the application of the BIT to investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law (or any successive statute). By contrast, the Parties are in disagreement on the temporal scope of application of Article III(1)(a), *i.e.* whether the requirement implies admission once upon entry into the country, as argued by the Claimant, or whether it extends through the entire duration of the investment operation, as advocated by the Respondent.\n\n267.\n\nIn accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal will start by ascertaining the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article III(1)(a). This provision requires an investment to \"have been granted admission\" by Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the verb \"to admit\" means \"to allow\" or \"to accept\".361 That same dictionary defines the noun \"admission\" as \"the process or fact of entering or being allowed to enter a place or organization\".362\n\nOxford Dictionary of English (2010), p. 22 (**Exh. CLA-113**).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n268.\n\nThe content of this definition and the observation that the admission must \"have been granted\" by the host State, leads the Tribunal to understand that the admission requirement set forth in Article III(1) is a one-time occurrence, a gateway through which all Australian investors must pass once.\n\n269.\n\nThe context confirms this understanding. Article III is entitled \"Scope of Agreement\", implying that investments that do not meet the requirements under Article III will not find protection under the Australia-Indonesia Treaty, even if the underlying operation qualifies as an investment under Article I(1)(a). The admission requirement is consequently of jurisdictional nature. As such, it necessarily applies at the time of entry into the country and not during the entire operation of the project. This conclusion is further confirmed by previous arbitral decisions.363\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, \u00b6 345 (**Exh. CLA-131**) ; *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6 127 (**Exh. RLA-058**).\n\n270.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal addresses certain additional arguments and cases which the Parties invoked. In this context, it agrees with the Claimant that the admission requirement embodied in Article III(1)(a) is narrower than a traditional legality requirement in the sense that it only demands admission in accordance with the relevant domestic laws and not general compliance with the host State's legislation.\n\n271.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's position, the Tribunal does not find that *Mytilineos*, *Gruslin*, and *Yaung Chi Oo* support the Respondent's argument. In *Mytilineos*, the tribunal was called upon to interpret a general \"in accordance with the legislation\" provision contained in the Greece-Yugoslavia BIT and the tribunal expressly mentioned that the treaty did not require any registration of investments.364\n\n*Mytilineos Holdings SA v. The State Union of Servia & Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 8 September 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 140, 146 (**Exh. rLa-071**).\n\n272.\n\nThe *Gruslin* decision is also inapposite here. It is true that the Belgium-Malaysia Intergovernmental Agreement under scrutiny there required that the assets be invested in Malaysia in an \"approved project\" classified as such by the relevant Ministry.365 The sole arbitrator found that this requirement was not satisfied through a general approval of the business activity, since the specific \"project\" needed approval.366 In the view of the Tribunal, *Gruslin* must be distinguished, since the thrust of Indonesia's argument is that Planet violated Indonesian laws after the approval of its investment, not in the making of the investment.\n\n*Philippe Gruslin v. Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/3, Award, 28 November 2000 *(\"\u2018Gruslin\"),* \u00b6 9.2 (**Exh. RLA-062**).\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 25.5.\n\n273.\n\nFinally, in *Yaung Chi Oo*, the tribunal refused jurisdiction on the ground that the investment had not obtained an additional approval in line with the requirements of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement.367 It held that all investors, including those who were already admitted in Myanmar prior to the entry into force of the ASEAN Agreement, had to apply for approval in conformity with Article II(3) of that treaty to benefit from treaty protection.368 The investor failed to do so and, hence, jurisdiction was denied.369\n\n*Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Government of the Union of Myanmar*, ASEAN Case No. ARB/01/1, Award, 31 March 2003 *(\"Yaung Chi Oo* \"), \u00b6 58 (**Exh. RLA-062**).\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 62 (**Exh. RLA-062**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 63.\n\n274.\n\nIn sum, none of these cases support Indonesia's argument that the admission requirement extends throughout the duration of the investor's activity. In other words, the admission requirement under Article III(1)(a) of the Treaty is restricted to the time of the initiation of the investment. The Tribunal must thus analyze the content of the admission requirement under the relevant legislation.\n\n3.2 The Indonesian Foreign Investment Law\n-----------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nForeign investment in Indonesia is governed by the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.370 This law was amended in 1970 in respect of matters of no relevance here,371 and then replaced on 26 April 2007 by the Investment Law No. 25 (\"2007 Investment Law\").372 As to the 2007 Investment Law, the Respondent acknowledges that it does not diverge significantly from its predecessor, save for the addition of Article 33.373\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2** ; **Exh. RLA-006**). *See* RMOJ, \u00b6 41. The Parties submitted different English versions of the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. However, neither Party indicated that there is any material difference between the two translations.\n\n**Exh. CLA-3**.\n\nLaw No. 25 on Investment (2007) (**Exh. RLA-009**; **Exh. CLA-4**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 47.\n\n276.\n\nIt is common ground that Planet acquired its interests in PT ICD on 24 April 2006 and that it obtained the BKPM Approval for this acquisition on 8 May 2006,374*i.e.* before the entry into force of the 2007 Investment Law. The Tribunal will thus assess the present objection by application of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 223.\n\n277.\n\nArticle 1 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law provides that it applies to \"direct foreign capital investment\" made in Indonesia.375 Article 2 defines foreign capital investment as including (a) foreign exchange, (b) equipment, and (c) transferable profits used to finance an enterprise in Indonesia.376 Article 3 defines an enterprise as understood in Article 2 as a legal entity organized under Indonesian law and domiciled in Indonesia. Under Articles 4 and 5 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, the Indonesian Government is empowered to determine the operating area for foreign capital and the fields of activity which are open to foreign investment.\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 1 (**Exh. CLA-2**; **Exh. RLA-006**).\n\n*Id.,* Art. 2(a)-(c).\n\n278.\n\nRegarding the field of mining activities, Article 8(1) of the law requires cooperation with the Government by way of a work contract or otherwise:\n\n\"Foreign investment in the field of mining shall be carried out in cooperation with the Government on the basis of a work contract (\" *kontrak karya* \") or other form in accordance with revailing [sic] regulations\".377\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 8(1) (**Exh. CLA-2**). *See also:* **Exh. RLA-006**, Art. 8(1).\n\n279.\n\nFinally, about the implementation of the law, Article 28(1) provides for coordination in the following terms:\n\n\"Provisions of this Law shall be implemented by coordination among the Government agencies concerned in order to ensure harmonization of Government policies regarding foreign capital\".378\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 28(1) (**Exh. CLA-2**).\n\n280.\n\nArticle 28(2) specifies that further provisions will be adopted in respect of procedures for the coordination contemplated in paragraph 1. The elucidation to Article 28, which is appended to the law, contemplates the creation of a coordination body. It states that the \"execution of this Law involves the domains of several Department [sic]. For that reason it is necessary to have a simple coordination body which may take the form of a council consisting of the Ministers concerned\".379\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Elucidation Article by Article, Art. 28 (**Exh. CLA-2**).\n\n281.\n\nThis being so, the 1967 Foreign Investment Law does not specify the procedures for a foreign investor to obtain the governmental approval contemplated in Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT, nor does it designate an authority in charge of implementing the law. The Parties agree that the BKPM, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board, is the responsible authority to grant the investment approvals contemplated in Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT.380\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 42; Reply, \u00b6 181.\n\n282.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Respondent, the BKPM was only created in 1973.381 It further notes that, under the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33 regarding the Capital Investment Coordinating Board, the BKPM has the duty to assist Indonesia's President in formulating investment policies, completing investment approvals and evaluating their implementation, and issuing business licenses.382\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00b6 2. It appears that the BKPM was created under the 1973 Presidential Decree No. 20. This Decree was not put into evidence by either Party.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 33 of 1981 Regarding the Capital Investment Coordinating Board, Art. 2 and 3(I) (**Exh. RLA-099** ; **Exh. CLA-366**).\n\n283.\n\nIn 2004, a so-called \"One-Roof Service System\" was established by Presidential Decree No. 29.383 According to that decree, the BKPM had delegated authority from the relevant Ministries to issue capital investment approvals under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Article 3 of the decree provides that:\n\n\"Services of capital investment approvals, permits and facilities as referred to in Article 2 letter c within the framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment are carried out by BKPM, based on delegation of authority by the Minister/Head of Non Departmental Government Institution which fosters the relevant lines of business of capital investment through the one-roof service system\".384\n\nPresidential Decree No. 29 of 2004 on the Implementation of Capital Investment within the Framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment through the One-Roof Service System (**Exh. C-361**; **Exh. RLA-106**). Article 1(5) of the Decree defines the One-Roof Service System as \"a system of the services of granting capital investment approvals and implementation permits carried out by one Government institution charged with responsibilities in the field of capital investment\".\n\n*Id.*, Art. 3.\n\n284.\n\nArticle 4 of Decree No. 29 further provides that decentralized governmental bodies may also delegate the authority to grant investment approvals to the BKPM:\n\n\"Governor/Regent/Mayor in line with his/her authority may delegate authority in investment approval, licenses and facilities services as meant in Article 2 letter c to BKPM (Investment Coordinating Board) through the one-stop service system\".385\n\n*Id.*, Art. 4.\n\n285.\n\nIn the field of mining, the Ministry of Mining had delegated its authority to the BKPM in 1978 already.386 As a result of this delegation and of the powers vested in the BKPM under the Decrees of 1981 and 2004, when Planet applied for its investment approval, the BKPM was the authority competent to grant that approval.\n\nDecree of Minister of Mining No. 211/Kpts/Pertamb/1978 Year 1978 concerning Delegation of Authority to the Chairman of Investment Coordinating Board to Grant [License to] Undertake Utilization of Extractive Materials and Provide Consultation on the Granting of Investment Facilities in the Field of Non-Oil and Natural Gas Mining and to Grant License to Undertake Mining Supporting Services, Art. 1 (**Exh. RLA-098**).\n\n286.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal must now determine whether Planet obtained the investment approval from the BKPM in conformity with Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT, thus enabling it to benefit from protection under the Treaty.\n\n3.3 The BKPM Approvals\n----------------------\n\n287.\n\nIt is undisputed that, pursuant to Article 3 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, Planet could only invest in Indonesia through a local vehicle incorporated and domiciled in Indonesia.387 It is equally undisputed that foreign investors seeking to invest in the mining sector can only do so through a foreign direct investment company, a so-called *Penanaman Modal Asing* (\"PMA\").\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 42; Reply, \u00b6 11.\n\n288.\n\nPlanet invested in Indonesia by acquiring a 5% share in an Indonesian PMA called PT Indonesian Coal Development or PT ICD. PT ICD was initially created by Profit Point Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi, an Indonesian national.388 Profit Point Group Ltd owned 95% of the shares and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi the remaining 5%.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 48.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that PT ICD \"received an approval from BKPM to be a *Penanaman Modal Asing* (PMA - foreign direct investment) company, operating as a *Perseroan Terbatas* (PT - limited liability company)\".389 The BKPM approved the incorporation of PT ICD on 23 November 2005 (the \"2005 BKPM Approval\").390\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nBKPM Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (**Exh. R-003**) ; Foreign Capital Investment Approval for PT ICD, Decision No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (**Exh. C-17**), both dated 23 November 2005.\n\n290.\n\nThe preamble of the 2005 BKPM Approval refers to (1) the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, (2) the 1967 Mining Law, (3) the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33 on the BKPM, (4) the 2004 Presidential Decree No. 29 on the One-Roof Service System, and (5) the 1978 Decree on the delegation of powers from the Ministry of Mining to the BKPM.391 The text of the 2005 BKPM Approval mentions the identity of the two applicants, the terms of the project, the name of the new company PT ICD, its business field, and the initial capital contribution of USD 250,000.392\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n291.\n\nOn 24 April 2006, the owners of PT ICD sold their shares to Churchill (95%) and Planet (5%).393 The change in shareholders was approved by the BKPM on 8 May 2006 (the \"2006 BKPM Approval\"),394 a fact that the Respondent concedes. Besides requiring that, within fifteen years from the start of commercial operations, PT ICD must sell part of its shares to Indonesian citizens, and that any subsequent change in the share capital must be approved by the BKPM, the 2006 BKPM Approval incorporates by reference the content of the 2005 BKPM Approval.\n\nShareholders Resolution Deed No. 17 dated 24 April 2006 (**Exh. R-005**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 223. Approval of Changes in Participation Within the Company's Capital for PT ICD, Decision No. 579/III/PMA/2006 dated 8 May 2006 (**Exh. C-24**).\n\n292.\n\nOn this basis, and in particular in view of the fact that PT ICD received the necessary approval by the BKPM in 2005 and that the change in PT ICD's shareholding was subsequently approved by the BKPM in 2006, the Tribunal concludes that Planet obtained the necessary approval when making its investment in May 2006, thus fulfilling the requirement set in Article III(1)(a) of the Australia-Indonesia BIT.\n\n293.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal denies Indonesia's second preliminary objection and concludes that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute.\n\n294.\n\nThe present decision is limited to jurisdiction and does not prejudge any alleged wrongdoing by the Claimant during the operation of the investment, which is a matter for the merits.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n295.\n\nWith regard to costs, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\n\"order [Planet] to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent\".395\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 257; Rejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n296.\n\nFor its part, the Claimant makes the following requests:\n\n\"1) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the [Planet] on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment; and\n\n2) Award any other relief the Tribunal deems just and appropriate\".396\n\nReply, \u00b6 200, point C.\n\n297.\n\nHaving come to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to reserve the decision on costs for a later decision.\n\n**VII.

THE CLAIMANT**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Churchill Mining Plc, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales on 24 February 2005 (Registration No. 5275606) (\"Churchill\" or the \"Claimant\"). It provides mining services, including general survey services, exploration and exploitation of mining sites.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Stephen Jagusch, Anthony Sinclair, Alex Gerbi, Epaminontas Triantafilou, Ms. Bridie Balderstone, and Mr. Benjamin Burnham of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP, and by Messrs. Fred Bennett, David Orta, and Tai-Heng Cheng of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Indonesia (\"Indonesia\" or the \"Respondent\"; and together with Churchill, the \"Parties\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Amir Syamsudin, Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Coordinator of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Didi Dermawan, Legal Representative of the Regent of East Kutai and the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Cahyo R. Muzhar, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia, Supporting Legal Team Member of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, Supporting Legal Team Member of Legal Representative Team of the President of the Republic of Indonesia; Dr. Freddy Harris, Secretary of Team Churchill Mining Case, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia; Mr. Richele S. Suwita, Ms. Marcia S. Tanudjaja, and Ms. Dwi Deila Wulandari Taslim of DNC Advocates at Work.\n\n**II. THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n5.\n\nThis section summarizes the facts of this dispute insofar as they bear relevance to Indonesia's objections to jurisdiction. Unless otherwise indicated the facts are undisputed.\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the present arbitration was consolidated with ICSID arbitration ARB/12/40 initiated by Planet Mining Pty Ltd, an Australian mining company wholly owned by Churchill. It was left open whether the Tribunal would render one or two decisions on jurisdiction or awards. The Tribunal has decided to issue two separate decisions (see below \u00b6 83). The facts and the procedural history are largely identical in both cases.\n\n**A. THE EAST KUTAI COAL PROJECT**\n----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe East Kutai Coal Project (the \"EKCP\") is a mining project developed by the Claimant jointly with various Indonesian companies in the Regency of East Kutai on the island of Kalimantan in Indonesia. According to various sources, the area encompassing the EKCP hosts the seventh largest coal deposit on the planet and the second largest coal deposit in Indonesia.1 The Claimant asserts that through surveys conducted over several years, it has confirmed the existence of approximately 2.7 billion metric tons of coal in the EKCP area.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.\n\n8.\n\nThe coal found there is classified as high-quality sub-bituminous coal with very low sulphur and ash content.2 According to the Claimant, this high-quality coal is ideally suited for the new generation power stations which have been developed lately in countries like India and China and are also in high demand in Europe because of their reduced environmental impact.3\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 9, 124.\n\nMem., \u00b6 124.\n\n9.\n\nRelying on a Feasibility Study modeling an evaluation of the EKCP for an initial 25-year period,4 the Claimant indicates that the project has a pre-tax net present value of approximately USD 1.8 billion and pre-tax cash flows in excess of USD 500 million per year over the first 20 years of capacity production.\n\nChurchill Mining Plc East Kutai Coal Project Feasibility Study, September 2010 (**Exh.

THE 2005 BKPM APPROVAL OF PT INDONESIA COAL DEVELOPMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 November 2005, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (\"BKPM\") delivered an authorization to PT Indonesian Coal Development (\"PT ICD\") to be incorporated as an Indonesian foreign direct-investment company (a so-called \"PMA\") and to conduct business in the mining sector in Indonesia (the \"2005 BKPM Approval\").8 PT ICD was initially created by Profit Point Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi, an Indonesian citizen and co-founder of the Ridlatama group.9 The authorized capital of PT ICD is Rupiah (\"Rp.\") 2,512,500,000, divided into 250'000 shares, with a nominal value of Rp. 10,050 per share.10 Profit Point Group Ltd acquired 237,500 shares and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi 12,500 shares.11\n\nForeign Capital Investment Approval for PT ICD, Decision No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (with Certificate of Translation) (**Exh.

CHURCHILL AND PLANET'S ACQUISITION OF SHARES IN PT ICD AND THE 2006 BKPM APPROVAL**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn 2006, an Indonesian group of companies, the Ridlatama group, introduced the EKCP to Churchill and Planet, who decided to invest in the project because they considered it promising. As a first step, Churchill and Planet entered into discussions with Ridlatama about acquiring PT ICD.\n\n16.\n\nOn 24 April 2006, Churchill and Planet acquired the shares in PT ICD from the initial shareholders, Profit Point Group Ltd and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi.15 Churchill acquired a 95% stake in PT ICD, while Planet acquired the remaining 5%. On 8 May 2006, the BKPM approved the change in PT ICD's shareholding (the \"2006 BKPM Approval\").16\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 62-66; RMOJ, \u00b6 50.\n\nApproval of Changes in Participation Within the Company's Capital for PT ICD, Decision No. 579/III/PMA/2006 dated 8 May 2006 (**Exh.

Their dispute is brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\") and the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 27 April 1976 (the \"UK-Indonesia BIT\", the \"Treaty\", or the \"BIT\").84 A parallel ICSID arbitration was initiated by Planet Mining Pty Ltd, an Australian mining company, against Indonesia essentially regarding the same set of facts. That dispute is brought under the Agreement concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 17 November 1992 (the \"Australia-Indonesia BIT\"). Eventually, the parties to these two proceedings agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations (see below \u00b6 58).\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"UK-Indonesia BIT\") (**Exh. CLA-18** ; **Exh. R-001**). The BIT entered into force on 24 March 1977.\n\n49.\n\nFor purposes of clarity, the present section will first address the initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 by Churchill, followed by an outline of the initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 by Planet, and then conclude with the procedural steps involved in the decision to consolidate both cases.\n\n**1. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, Churchill Mining Plc filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the UK-Indonesia BIT. In its Request for Arbitration, Churchill requested that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n\"(i) declaring that Respondent has violated its international legal obligations under the Treaty;\n\n(ii) ordering Respondent to pay to Claimant full compensation in accordance with the Treaty and customary international law, in an amount to be established in the arbitration;\n\n(iii) ordering Respondent to pay all costs of this arbitration, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the tribunal and the cost of legal representation;\n\n(iv) ordering Respondent to pay pre- and post- award compound interest up until full payment of the award at a rate deemed appropriate by the arbitral tribunal; and\n\n(v) ordering such other relief as the arbitral tribunal may deem appropriate in the circumstances\".85\n\nC-RFA, \u00b6 92.\n\n51.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Churchill's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On 14 September 2012, the Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case be constituted pursuant to the formula provided by Articles 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 19 September 2012, Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, accepted his appointment as the Claimant-appointed arbitrator. On 21 September 2012, Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a Singaporean national, accepted his appointment as the Respondent-appointed arbitrator. On 3 October 2012, Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, accepted her appointment as President of the Tribunal. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) and the proceedings commenced on 3 October 2012. On the same date, the Centre designated Mr. Paul-Jean Le Cannu as Secretary of the Tribunal. After having obtained the agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal informed the Parties by letter of 5 February 2013 that the appointment of Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer as Assistant to the Tribunal had become effective.\n\n52.\n\nOn 27 November 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held the first session by video link. During that session, the Parties agreed on several procedural issues and addressed several outstanding issues which are outlined in more detail below. On 6 December 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing the schedule of submissions for the jurisdictional phase. It was decided that a hearing on jurisdiction would take place in Singapore on 13 May 2013, May 14 being kept as a reserve day.\n\n53.\n\nOn 20 November 2012, the Government of the Regency of East Kutai submitted, with the support of the Republic of Indonesia, a Petition to participate as a party in these proceedings. Churchill objected to this request, asking the Tribunal to dismiss the petition. On 5 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 rejecting the Petition on the grounds of lack of consent of Churchill to join the Government of the Regency of East Kutai to the proceedings.\n\n54.\n\nOn 22 November 2012, Indonesia filed a Request for Provisional Measures and a Document Production Request in connection with jurisdiction. With regard to the Request for Provisional Measures, Indonesia asked that Churchill refrain (i) from making false, unfounded and misleading statements in the media regarding the case at hand, and (ii) from approaching and/or persuading and/or inducing any officials of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to enter into amicable settlement outside the arbitral proceedings. On 17 December 2012, Churchill filed its observations, which were followed by Indonesia's reply on 7 January 2013. On 21 January 2013, Churchill filed its rejoinder to Indonesia's reply. In its decision of 4 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 finding that the conditions for the recommendation of provisional measures were not met, thus rejecting the provisional measures sought by Indonesia.\n\n55.\n\nWith respect to the Document Production Request, Churchill filed its Response to Indonesia's document request, whereby Churchill undertook to produce the requested documents with its first memorial. After having heard the respective views of the Parties, the Tribunal decided that Churchill should produce the requested documents together with an explanatory note by 17 December 2012. On that date, Churchill submitted to Indonesia all of the requested documents.\n\n56.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, Churchill submitted to the Tribunal an amended Request for Arbitration purportedly adding PT Indonesia Coal Development (PT ICD) as a claimant in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14. After having heard both Parties' position at the 1 March 2013 common session (see below \u00b6 58), the Tribunal informed the Parties by letter of 4 March 2013 that the request was denied on the grounds of lack of consent of Indonesia to join PT ICD to the proceedings.\n\n**2. Initiation of ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, Planet Mining Pty Ltd sent a Notification of Dispute to the Republic of Indonesia. On 26 November 2012, Planet then filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Australia-Indonesia BIT. On 26 December 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Planet's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**3. Consolidation**\n--------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Parties in ICSID Cases No. ARB/12/14 and No. ARB/12/40 held a common session by video link on 1 March 2013, which was sound and video recorded. Besides serving as the first session in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40 pursuant to Rule 13 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the common session addressed consolidation. Having secured the agreement in principle of the Parties that the two disputes be heard in a consolidated case,86 the Tribunal heard the Parties on the modalities of consolidation. The Tribunal noted that the Parties agreed to join the two proceedings in all respects, but disagreed on whether the Tribunal should render one joint decision/award in respect of both Churchill and Planet or two separate decisions/awards, one in respect of each claimant.\n\n*See*, *inter alia*, Planet's letter of 4 October 2012; Churchill's letter of 12 October 2012; and Indonesia's letter of 4 January 2013.\n\n59.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the content of the common session. With regard to the modalities of the consolidated proceedings, it decided that the procedural calendar under Annex 3 to Procedural Order No. 1, amended by letter of 21 February 2013 and supplemented by letter of 1 March 2013, would govern; that the Tribunal's orders issued as of the date of the common session would apply to all three Parties, with the exception of Procedural Order No. 3 dealing with Indonesia's request for provisional measures in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14; that the Centre would maintain only one case account; and that Mr. Magnus Jesko Langer would serve as assistant to the Tribunal in the consolidated proceedings.\n\n60.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal noted that it would decide whether to render one or two awards at a later stage, after consultation with the Parties.\n\n**B. WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn paragraph 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by the Tribunal's letter of 21 February 2013, and recorded in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal set the following schedule for the jurisdictional phase:\n\n(i) Churchill and Planet would file their Memorial by 13 March 2013;\n\n(ii) the Respondent would file its Objections to Jurisdiction by 8 April 2013;\n\n(iii) Churchill and Planet would file their Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction by 30 April 2013; and\n\n(iv) the Respondent would file a Reply to the Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction by 6 May 2013.\n\n62.\n\nDuring the common session of 1 March 2013, the Respondent stated that it intended to make additional document requests in connection with jurisdiction. After having heard the views of Churchill and Planet, the Tribunal established the following schedule for document production in a letter of 1 March 2013, confirmed in Procedural Order No. 4:\n\n(i) the Respondent would file its Request by 6 March 2013;\n\n(ii) Churchill and Planet would state their Response to the Request and any objections thereto by 11 March 2013;\n\n(iii) the Respondent would respond to the aforementioned objections, if any, by 14 March 2013;\n\n(iv) the Tribunal would rule on the objections, if any, by 19 March 2013; and\n\n(v) Churchill and Planet would produce those documents for which no objection has been sustained by the Tribunal by 22 March 2013.\n\n63.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 ruling on the objections to the document production request submitted by Churchill and Planet. By letter of 22 March 2013, Churchill and Planet informed the Tribunal that they had sent hard copies of all responsive documents in their possession at that time, and that they would adhere to the continuing obligation under Procedural Order No. 5 to produce any outstanding final awards or decisions, as specified in that Order, as soon as they become available.\n\n64.\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Churchill and Planet filed their Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits, enclosing 348 exhibits and 69 legal exhibits. In the Request for Relief, Churchill requested the following relief:\n\n(i) a declaration that Indonesia had violated Article 5 of the UK-Indonesia BIT;\n\n(ii) a declaration that Indonesia had violated Article 3 of the UK-Indonesia BIT;\n\n(iii) an order directing Indonesia to pay monetary compensation or damages or alternatively, full compensation for Churchill's expenses - in each case in amounts to be specified in the Claimant's forthcoming quantum presentation - plus interest thereon, compounded quarterly, accruing at a reasonable commercial rate per annum to be determined by the Tribunal, from 4 May 2010 through to the date of payment;\n\n(iv) an order directing Indonesia to pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the respective arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by Churchill on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment; and\n\n(v) any other relief the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate.\n\n65.\n\nOn 8 April 2013, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing 101 exhibits and 77 legal exhibits. In the Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent contends (i) that the \"Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain [Churchill's] claims due to the absence of any written consent by the Respondent to submit the dispute encompassed by the Request[...] for Arbitration\",87 and (ii) that \"all of the claims asserted by [Churchill] should be dismissed as [Churchill is] seeking the protection of the U.K.-Indonesia [...] [BIT] for investments which have not been admitted by the Republic of Indonesia and which, consequently, fall outside the scope of protected investments under [this BIT]\".88 For these reasons, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and\n\n(ii) order [Churchill] to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent.89\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 255.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 256.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 257.\n\n66.\n\nOn 30 April 2013, the Churchill and Planet filed their Reply to Indonesia's Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing 12 exhibits and 70 legal exhibits. The Reply was also accompanied by the Second Expert Report of the Claimants' expert on Indonesian law, Dr. Nono A. Makarim. In their Response, Churchill and Planet requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Indonesia; and\n\n(ii) Declare that it had jurisdiction under the UK-Indonesia BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n(iii) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereon at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs were incurred to the date of payment; and\n\n(iv) Award any other relief the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate.90\n\nReply, \u00b6 200.\n\n67.\n\nOn 6 May 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, enclosing 9 exhibits and 28 legal exhibits. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent contended that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case because:\n\n(i) The Respondent has not provided its consent in writing to submit the disputes encompassed in the Requests for Arbitration to ICSID;\n\n(ii) Churchill's alleged investments do not fall within the scope of investments protected under the U.K.-Indonesia BIT, because (a) Churchill violated the terms of the investment approvals by engaging in activities not contemplated in the approvals, including using PT ICD as an investment vehicle; (b) Churchill, in complete disregard of Indonesian laws prohibiting PMA companies such as PT ICD to own shares or any interest in KP Holders such as the Ridlatama Companies, entered into beneficial ownership arrangements in order to circumvent that limitation, thereby violating Article 1320 of the Civil Code and Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law.91\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 135.\n\n68.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and\n\n(ii) order Churchill to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, the Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by the Respondent.92\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n69.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone conference in order to discuss outstanding matters related to the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction. The telephone conference was audio-recorded. On the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 containing the schedule of the hearing.\n\n**C.

A *verbatim* transcript was produced and subsequently distributed to the Parties.\n\n**D. POST-HEARING PHASE**\n-------------------------\n\n74.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 confirming that there would be no post-hearing briefs, that corrections to the hearing transcript were due by 29 May 2013, that the Tribunal would decide on any disagreement between the Parties in this respect, and that each Party was to submit its statement of costs by 5 June 2013, allowing the other Party to comment by 12 June 2013. The Parties submitted their agreed revisions to the hearing transcript on 29 May 2013.\n\n75.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal identified several matters requiring further submissions. On 22 July 2013, the Tribunal sent to the Parties a series of questions, inviting them to respond simultaneously by 12 August 2013, and to comment, again simultaneously, by 16 August 2013. On the Claimant's request, the Tribunal postponed these dates and the Parties filed their submissions on 23 and 30 August 2013.\n\n76.\n\nHaving deliberated, the Tribunal renders the present decision on jurisdiction.93 The Tribunal will first summarize the positions of the Parties (Section IV), then analyze these positions (Section V), and finally set out its decision on jurisdiction (Section VI).\n\nThe Tribunal uses the term \"jurisdiction\" as referring to \"the jurisdiction of the Centre\" and \"the competence of the Tribunal\" (see Art. 41(2) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n**IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Indonesia raised the following objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal with regard to Churchill:\n\n(i) Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT does not provide consent to ICSID arbitration;\n\n(ii) the BKPM approvals provided to PT ICD do not contain consent to ICSID arbitration of the claims asserted by Churchill; and\n\n(iii) the investment is not covered by Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, as it has not been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.\n\n78.\n\nOn the basis of these arguments, Indonesia invites the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) decline jurisdiction in the present case; and\n\n(ii) order Churchill to pay the totality of costs relating to this Arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal, Respondent's legal fees and all other amounts incurred by Respondent.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, the Claimant put forward the following main arguments:\n\n(i) Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration under the UK-Indonesia BIT;\n\n(ii) in any event, the requirement of consent under the UK-Indonesia BIT is fulfilled by way of the BKPM Approvals granted to PT ICD;\n\n(iii) the investment has been admitted in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.\n\n80.\n\nOn the basis of these contentions, Churchill Mining Plc requests the Tribunal to:\n\n1) Reject all jurisdictional objections raised by Indonesia; and\n\n2) Declare that it has jurisdiction under the UK-Indonesia BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n3) Order that Indonesia pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID as well as legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimant on a full indemnity basis, plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment; and\n\n4) Award any other relief the Tribunal deems just and appropriate.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address a number of preliminary matters (A) before it enters into the analysis of the jurisdictional objections (B and C).\n\n**A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. One or two decisions/awards?**\n-----------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nAt the common session during which consolidation of the proceedings before the Tribunal was agreed, the Respondent indicated a preference for a single decision/award, while Churchill and Planet asked for two separate decisions/awards. The issue was left open and Procedural Order No. 4, issued after the common session, states that the Tribunal would resolve it after further consultation with the Parties.94 At the hearing, the Tribunal again requested the Parties' views.95 The Respondent reiterated its preference for a single decision/award, and stated that \"Planet is controlled by Churchill Mining and the claims are the same, so the fact that there are two different bilateral investment treaties is really irrelevant for us. So we would like the tribunal just to render one award or one decision on jurisdiction\".96 Churchill and Planet, for their part, maintained their prior position and stated that \"the earlier position we articulated was that we encouraged the efficiencies to be gained by having single hearings in respect of the two cases and that we sought separate awards, and that remains our position\".97\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6 1.3.4.\n\nTr. 14052013, 126:3-22.\n\nTr. 14052013, 155:7-12.\n\nTr. 14052013, 166:6-10.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that it must respect the modalities of consolidation agreed by the Parties. The Parties have agreed to consolidate the two arbitrations for all purposes including the conduct of the proceedings and the case account, with the exception of the decisions/awards. Absent consent in this latter respect, the Tribunal considers that it lacks the power to issue a joint decision or award. Hence, the Tribunal will render two separate decisions, the first and present one concerning Churchill (original ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14) and the second one concerning Planet (original ICSID Case No. ARB/12/40).\n\n**2. The relevance of previous ICSID decisions or awards**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIn support of their positions, the Parties relied on previous ICSID decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions.98 At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it deems that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It further deems that, subject to the specific provisions of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.\n\nIn its Reply, \u00b6 173, the Claimant indicates that \"investor-state jurisprudence, which constitutes nonbinding but persuasive authority [constitutes] therefore appropriate \u2018supplementary means of interpretation' under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention\". In its Rejoinder, \u00b6 18, the Respondent states that \"scholarly commentary constitutes a \u2018subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law' in international law (Art. 38(1)(d) of the ICJ Statute)\". In a footnote, Rejoinder, \u00b6 18, n. 45, the Respondent adds that \"[t]his is true as well for the reasoning of the tribunal in *Millicom* \", *infra* note 115. *See also* : Tr. 13052013, 139:22-140:16.\n\n**3. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction is contingent upon the provisions of the ICSID Convention on the one hand, and of the UK-Indonesia BIT,99 on the other hand. In addition, where an international law instrument refers to jurisdictional requirements governed by the municipal law of a Contracting State, that municipal law shall also govern the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to the extent provided by the BIT.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 27 April 1976, U.K. Treaty Series No. 62 (1977) (**Exh. CLA-18**).\n\n3.1 Jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\".\n\n88.\n\nAccordingly, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides for four requirements for jurisdiction. There must be (i) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State,100 (ii) of a legal nature, (iii) arising directly from an investment,101 and (iv) the Parties must have consented in writing to arbitration.\n\nMem., \u00b6 312; Reply, \u00b6 5; Tr. 13052013, 8:10-11.\n\nMem., \u00b6 313; Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\n89.\n\nThere is no dispute on the first three requirements and rightly so. Indeed, the Tribunal is satisfied that these requirements are met. By contrast, there is a dispute about the fourth requirement, Indonesia arguing in its first jurisdictional objection that it has not consented to submit the present dispute to ICSID arbitration.\n\n3.2 Jurisdictional requirements under the BIT\n---------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nArticle 7(1) of the BIT provides the following:\n\nThe Contracting Party in the territory of which a national or company of the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment shall assent to any request on the part of such national or company to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any dispute that may arise in connection with the investment.\n\n91.\n\nIt is undisputed that Indonesia is a Contracting Party of the BIT, and that Churchill qualifies as a \"national or company of the other Contracting Party\", i.e. of the United Kingdom. It is equally undisputed that Churchill has made an investment in the territory of Indonesia, and that the dispute arises in connection with the investment.\n\n92.\n\nIt is further common ground that Article 2(1) of the BIT spells out an additional requirement for jurisdiction, namely that the investment must \"have been granted admission in accordance with the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 or any law amending or replacing it\". It does so in the following terms:\n\nThis Agreement shall only apply to investments of nationals or companies of the United Kingdom in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 or any law amending or replacing it.\n\n93.\n\nIn this latter respect, the Tribunal notes that the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 (\"1967 Foreign Investment Law\") was amended by Law No. 11 of 1970,102 and replaced on 26 April 2007 by Law No. 25 of 2007 concerning Investment (\"2007 Investment Law\").103\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2**).\n\nLaw No. 25 on Investment (2007) (**Exh. CLA-4**).\n\n94.\n\nThe Parties diverge on the fulfillment of the requirement spelled out under Article 2(1), which is the object of Indonesia's second jurisdictional objection.\n\n3.3 Rules for treaty interpretation\n-----------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and the BIT must be interpreted pursuant to the rules of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) which codifies customary international law. The Tribunal expands on such rules in its analysis below.\n\n3.4 Test for jurisdiction\n-------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAt the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must establish (i) that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of the Treaty are met, which includes proving the facts necessary to meet these requirements, and (ii) that it has a *prima facie* cause of action under the Treaty, that is, that the facts it alleges are susceptible of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they are ultimately proven. The Tribunal finds that this test strikes a proper balance between a more exacting standard which would call for examination of the merits at the jurisdictional stage, and a less exacting standard which would confer excessive weight to the Claimant's own characterization of its claims.\n\n**B. FIRST OBJECTION: CONSENT**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nIndonesia challenges jurisdiction on the ground that it has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction under the UK-Indonesia BIT. Bearing in mind the fundamental requirement of State consent under international law (1.1. below) and the general rules of treaty interpretation (1.2. below), Indonesia argues in essence that Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT does not provide consent to ICSID arbitration with respect to Churchill's claims (1.3. below). More specifically, Indonesia contends that the \"shall assent\" clause contained in Article 7(1) does not constitute consent for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and that a subsequent act is required to achieve consent. In this case, Indonesia has not performed such subsequent act thereby exercising a Treaty-based right (1.4. below). In this respect, it also contends that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to assess whether Indonesia legitimately withheld its consent. Finally, Indonesia submits that the BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not encompass Indonesia's consent to ICSID arbitration of the claims asserted by Churchill (1.5. below), and that, in any event, they do not extend to Churchill (1.6. below).\n\n1.1 State consent is a fundamental requirement under international law\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nIndonesia recalls that the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals is based on the consent of States, and that various ICSID tribunals have described consent as the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals.104 State consent cannot be presumed; it must be established by definitive evidence.105 In the framework of ICSID, \"consent must be supplied by a written manifestation of consent\".106\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 142-143; Tr. 13052013, 131:21-133:4.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 145; Tr. 13052013, 132:19-25. The Respondent relies in particular on the *Daimler* decision, where it was held that \"it is not possible to presume that consent has been given by state [\u2026] Non-consent is the default rule; consent is the exception. Establishing consent therefore requires affirmative evidence\". **Exh. RLA-020**, \u00b6 175.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 146.\n\n1.2 The rules on treaty interpretation as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIndonesia argues that Article 7(1) must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31-33 of the VCLT. In this respect, Indonesia puts emphasis on the ordinary meaning of the provision; a holistic approach, considering the object and purpose of the BIT, would not justify disregarding the words themselves.107 Indonesia also claims that \"interpretation of a treaty cannot amount to its revision\".108 Finally, for Indonesia, the Tribunal should apply the principle of contemporaneity and determine the original will of the Contracting States, instead of adopting an evolutionary interpretation of the dispute settlement clause contained in the BIT.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 149. \"Under Article 31, a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of the treaty's object and purpose. The holistic approach of considering the object and purpose of a treaty in the interpretation of its terms does not justify disregard of the words themselves\".\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 175; Rejoinder, \u00b6 17; Tr. 13052013, 137:5-7.\n\n1.3 Article 7(1) of the BIT does not provide consent\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIndonesia submits that the \"shall assent\" clause in Article 7(1) does not provide \"automatic\" consent to ICSID arbitration. For consent to be established, the State must perform a further act following the submission of a request by a claimant. In support of this position, the Respondent advances essentially six arguments: first, the ordinary meaning of \"shall assent\" is clear - it requires an additional act of consent; second, the structure of the UK-Indonesia BIT, in particular the link between Articles 7(1) and 2(1), confirms the ordinary meaning of \"shall assent\"; third, the object and purpose of a treaty cannot defeat its plain language; fourth, particular attention must be paid to the principle of contemporaneity; fifth, doctrinal writings support Indonesia's understanding of Article 7(1); and sixth, no relevance should be attributed to the *Millicom* decision.\n\n101.\n\nFirst and foremost, Indonesia argues that the ordinary meaning of the \"shall assent\" clause in Article 7(1) of the BIT cannot be understood as conferring automatic jurisdiction to the Tribunal, it is a *pactum de contrahendo* whereby the Contracting State must and can only give its consent after the filing of a request by a qualifying investor.109\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 151.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the \"shall assent\" clause requires a further declaration on the part of Indonesia.110 The clause merely requires a Contracting Party to the BIT to give its assent to ICSID arbitration after having been requested to do so by a qualifying investor. Indonesia contrasts the \"shall assent\" clause with the \"hereby consents\" clause found in the UK Model BIT. The latter provides for *ex ante* consent, while the former envisages *ex post* consent.111\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 152.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 157.\n\n103.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the \"shall assent\" clause presumes a sequence \"in which the investor first makes a request to which the host state is expected to assent\".112 Therefore, in the absence of a subsequent declaration, the Tribunal cannot but deny its jurisdiction.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 152.\n\n104.\n\nSecond, the structure of the BIT with respect to the \"shall assent\" clause and the link to other jurisdictional requirements confirms Indonesia's position.\n\n105.\n\nFor the Respondent, Article 7(1) institutes a two-step procedure allowing Indonesia to refuse to consent if other jurisdictional requirements are not fulfilled,113 in particular, if the investment has not been granted admission in accordance with Indonesia's Foreign Investment Capital Law as required by Article 2(1) of the BIT.114\n\nTr. 13052013, 134:11-16.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 186.\n\n106.\n\nIn this context, Indonesia distinguishes *Millicom v. Senegal* to which we will revert below.115 It also relies on *Desert Line v. Yemen*, where the tribunal held that some States \"require that investors wishing to be protected must identify themselves, on the footing that only specifically approved investments will give rise to benefits under the relevant treaty\".116 The tribunal, which expressly referred to the UK-Indonesia BIT,117 went on to state that \"[t]his is a different approach, but it too has a legitimate policy rationale, in the sense that the Governments of such States evidently wish to exercise a qualitative control on the types of investments which are indeed to be promoted and protected\".118\n\n*Millicom International Operations B.V. and Sentel GSM S.A. v. Republic of Senegal* (\" *Millicom* \"), ICSID Case No. ARB/08/20, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 July 2010 (**Exh. CLA-65**).\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, February 6, 2008 (\" *Desert Line\"),* \u00b6 108 (**Exh. RLA-061**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 184.\n\n*Desert Line*, \u00b6 108.\n\n107.\n\nThird, Indonesia contends that \"an interpretation based upon the object and purpose cannot go against the plain language of the treaty\".119 It submits that the encouragement and protection of foreign investments is not the sole object and purpose of the BIT and that a \"State may balance the policy of encouraging investment by investors of the other State party to the BIT with other policies or considerations, one of which may be to preserve the ability to avoid ICSID arbitration of disputes relating to investments outside the protection of the BIT in question\".120 The screening of foreign investments is a legitimate policy which is reflected in the drafting of Article 7(1) of the Treaty.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 155.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 154.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, even if the object and purpose of the BIT were limited to the encouragement and protection of foreign investments, it cannot defeat the clear language of the \"shall assent\" clause.121 In support, Indonesia in particular quotes the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, which held that \"[t]he object and purpose is not to be considered in isolation from the terms of the treaty; it is intrinsic to its text. It follows that, under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, a treaty's object and purpose is to be used only to clarify the text, not to provide independent sources of meaning that contradict the clear text\".122 In connection with the relationship between the object and purpose of an investment treaty and the dispute settlement clause more specifically, Indonesia refers to the tribunal in *Telenor Mobile v. Hungary,* which stressed that its task was \"to interpret the BIT [...], not to displace, by reference to general policy considerations concerning investor protection, the dispute resolution mechanism specifically negotiated by the parties\".123\n\nTr. 13052013, 137:5-7.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 177, citing *United States v. Iran*, Decision No. 130-A28-FT, 19 December 2000, 36 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 5, \u00b6 58 (**Exh. RLA-052**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 178.\n\n109.\n\nFourth, although unqualified direct consent to ICSID jurisdiction may not be exceptional anymore in today's times, Indonesia submits that such consent was rather uncommon in the 1970s. Therefore, the principle of contemporaneity must apply in order to assess the real intent of the Contracting States at the time of the conclusion of the BIT in 1976.124 In support of this proposition, Indonesia invokes the comments of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office on the UK Draft Model BIT which contains a \"hereby consents\" clause, but recognize that prospective signatories \"may wish to reserve themselves the right to decide in the case of each individual dispute whether they are prepared to have referred to the Centre for arbitration\".125\n\nTr. 13052013, 138:2-4.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 156.\n\n110.\n\nFifth, Indonesia claims that there is virtual unanimity among commentators for its view of the \"shall assent\" clause. It finds support from the authors who directly refer to the UK-Indonesia BIT,126 from those commenting on similar provisions in other treaties,127 and from those making general comments on instruments providing for future consent.128\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 159.

Senegal*.129 There, the Tribunal found that nothing in the wording of the \"shall assent\" clause in the Netherlands-Senegal BIT \"leads to the conclusion that such decision could be left up to the discretion of the State\", and held that \"it is more reasonable to view this as a unilateral offer and a commitment by Senegal to submit itself to ICSID jurisdiction\".130 Indonesia contends that \"the *Millicom* decision can hardly be taken as a persuasive authority, let alone one having conclusively settled the issue\".131\n\n*Millicom, supra* note 115 (**Exh. CLA-65**).\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 63.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 172.\n\n113.\n\nSpecifically, Indonesia argues that *Millicom* does not apply to the present case for the following reasons: (i) the *Millicom* tribunal reached its conclusion without discussing any of the doctrinal writings referred to abov *e* ; (ii) commentators have criticized the *Millicom* decision as being \"debatable\", \"inconsistent with the clear and unambiguous treaty language\", and \"contrary to the letter of the treaty\"; (iii) the *Millicom* tribunal's interpretation amounts to treaty revision; (iv) its methodology is fundamentally flawed as it allows the alleged purpose of the treaty to override the plain text; (v) unlike Senegal *,* Indonesia does not argue that it has discretion to consent or not to a request submitted by an investor. Rather, it claims that it exercised its right to withhold its consent; and (vi) the structure of the BIT, reflecting the \"approved investment\" approach, is markedly different from the Netherlands-Senegal BIT, which requires that the investment be \"in accordance with local law\".\n\n1.4 Indonesia legitimately exercised its treaty-based right to withhold consent\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT limits protection to investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law or any law amending or replacing it.132 Indonesia considers that Churchill's investment does not meet this requirement, thus justifying its refusal to arbitrate the present dispute.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 210-213; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n\n115.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal could not accept jurisdiction on the ground that Indonesia's refusal to give consent is illegal, as this would \"put the cart before the horse\".133 Indeed, the Tribunal must have jurisdiction to be able to rule on the legality of Indonesia's omission. Indonesia further asserts that any challenge of its refusal is subject to the State-to-State dispute resolution mechanism provided in the BIT. In other words, this Tribunal is the wrong tribunal and the Claimant is the wrong party for that hypothetical dispute.134\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 212\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 66.\n\n1.5 The BKPM approvals granted to PT ICD do not contain consent to ICSID arbitration of Churchill's claims\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIndonesia notes further that Churchill did not rely on the BKPM approvals in its Request for Arbitration; it relied exclusively on the BIT as the source of Indonesia's consent.135 Churchill's attempt to amend its Request for Arbitration on 1 March 2013 by including PT ICD as another claimant demonstrates that Churchill knows well that consent is lacking under the BIT and that the BKPM approvals only cover PT ICD, not Churchill.136\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 189.\n\n*Id.*\n\n117.\n\nMore specifically, Indonesia submits that Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval does not constitute consent to ICSID arbitration, because (i) the BKPM does not have authority to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, (ii) the wording of Section IX(4) does not include consent on the part of Indonesia, because the word *bersedia* means \"is prepared/ready\"137 and not \"is willing\" as proposed by the Claimant;138 (iii) in any case, Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval only extends to PT ICD and not to the Claimant,139 and (iv) the UK-Indonesia BIT only contemplates consent given by Indonesia after the request has been submitted to ICSID, as opposed to consent given through an instrument drafted in 2005.140\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 192. *See* the Respondent's translation of the BKPM Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005 (**Exh.

If you treated it as you mention it, willingness or preparedness to follow, then it will not. Because once the dispute arises, then BKPM will help the investors to go back to the one who has the authority to give us consent\".142\n\nTr. 13052013, 97:25-106:16. *See also* : R-PHB1, pp. 5-6; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 1-9.\n\nTr. 13052013.105:12-18.\n\n119.\n\nThus, according to Indonesia, the BKPM's \"preparedness\" can only be interpreted as meaning that, if an investor raises a dispute with the BKPM or any other agency of the Government, such as the Ministry of Mining, then the BKPM would act as an intermediary to \"assist the investors to go back to the one who holds the authority\", i.e. the President of the Republic.143\n\nTr. 13052013, 106:13-15.\n\n120.\n\nAt the hearing, a member of the Tribunal asked the Respondent whether it could point to any Indonesian law or regulation prohibiting the BKPM to give consent to ICSID arbitration. The Respondent answered that the question should be put differently. As Article 2 of Law No. 5 of 1968,144 read in combination with the Indonesian constitution,145 provides that only the Government, i.e. the President, has the authority to grant ICSID consent, it should be explored whether there is a law or regulation delegating such authority to the BKPM:\n\n\"[Tribunal:] The real question is, if you want to say that BKPM has no authority to give this consent to ICSID dispute resolution, then can you ask - I've asked Dr. Makarim whether he is aware of any law that prevents them from giving that assent or that consent and he says he is not. So if you are aware of some law that does constrain BKPM's powers in regard to saying what they said in 9(4), then why don't you put it to Dr. Makarim?\n\n[Respondent:] Okay. Because the way I want to ask is different than the way what you just mentioned. You are coming from whether there is any law restricting constraining but this is not the way it works. It should be whether there is any law giving authority to BKPM in granting the consent required under the ICSID Conventions where our law number 5 1968, on the ratification of the ICSID Convention, article 2 clearly stipulate that that authority to give consent is with the government, and based on our constitutions that government is solely represented by the president and then of course it is the president then whether or not he wants to delegate\".146\n\nLaw No. 5 Year 1968, concerning approval to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, with Elucidation (**Exh.

Indeed, none of the Requests for Arbitration referred to the 2005 BKPM Approval as source of Indonesia's consent; they only relied on the BITs. In any event, the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval shows that it only covers disputes with PT ICD.152 The word \"perusahaan\" is correctly translated as \"company\", i.e. PT ICD, and not as \"business\" as contended by the Claimant.153\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 189; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63; Tr. 14052013, 141:3-143:7; R-PHB1, pp. 6-8; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 10-18.\n\nR-PHB1, pp. 7-8; R-PHB2, \u00b6 15.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nIn addition to stressing that it is an investor and that all other jurisdictional requirements are met,154 the Claimant submits that Indonesia has consented to ICSID arbitration under the BIT (2.1. through 2.5. below). However, in the event that the Tribunal were to hold that the BIT requires additional consent, Churchill submits that Indonesia has provided such consent by issuing the BKPM Approvals (2.6. below).\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 291-300; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 83-86. Regarding fulfillment of the requirements under the ICSID Convention: Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 312-315.\n\n125.\n\nIn its written submissions and at the hearing, the Claimant identified Indonesia's submissions and evidence which, in its view, have no bearing on jurisdiction.155 These include (i) whether the Claimant's initial interest was in East Kutai or Sendawar; (ii) its allegedly misleading public announcements; (iii) Indonesia's allegation that the Claimant misled its investors; and (iv) Indonesia's \"aspersion\" on the character of the Claimant's witness, Mr. Quinlivan.\n\nReply, \u00b6 4 (referring to Indonesia's \"unsupported and inaccurate aspersions\"; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 49-53, 55, 57-58, 62-63, 114, 120, 122-123, 124, 126-128, 130); Tr. 13052013, 13:6-14:16.\n\n2.1 Indonesia has given its consent under Article 7(1) of the BIT\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 7(1) provides Indonesia's written consent to ICSID arbitration. It essentially expands on its position in four steps. First, it outlines the relevant rules on treaty interpretation (2.2. below); second, it discusses its main contention according to which the words \"shall assent\" provide automatic consent to ICSID arbitration upon filing of the Request for Arbitration (2.3. below); third, it disputes Indonesia's reliance on the principle of contemporaneity (2.4. below); and fourth, it challenges the impact of various authorities cited by the Respondent (2.5. below).\n\n2.2 Treaty interpretation rules\n-------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIn connection with treaty interpretation, the Claimant summarized at the hearing its position with regard to the relevant dispute settlement clause as follows:\n\n\"Did the drafters intend that the words \"shall assent\", far from creating certainty, would actually introduce some sort of an option for a state to breach the treaty and prevent resolution of a dispute in a neutral forum? Plainly, they did not. That would be contrary to the object and purpose of the treaty, contrary to the stated desire to achieve certainty and security for investors, contrary to good faith interpretation of treaties [\u2026], and also contrary to the obligation to perform treaties in good faith\".156\n\nTr. 14052013, 24:22-25:9.\n\n128.\n\nAccording to Churchill, there is a hierarchy between the general rule of interpretation under Article 31 VCLT and recourse to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.157 Supplementary means can only come into play if the meaning of the terms is not clear.158 The interpretation must therefore begin with the language and ensure that the meaning of the Treaty's terms is consistent with the rest of the Treaty, including the preamble and annexes and the specific materials listed under Article 31(2)(a)-(b) and 31(3)(a)-(c) of the VCLT.159\n\nReply, \u00b6 93.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 35.\n\nReply, \u00b6 92.\n\n2.3 \"Shall assent\" provides automatic consent\n---------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nChurchill disputes Indonesia's interpretation of the terms \"shall assent\", arguing that Indonesia's proposed solution of diplomatic protection runs counter to the modern investor-state system and that it would leave the Claimant *de facto* without recourse.160 The ordinary meaning of \"shall\" denotes a binding obligation; it does not provide Indonesia with an \"option to veto\".161 The \" shall assent\" wording suggests the opposite of an option. The drafters inserted the word \"shall\" to implement certainty, not to grant the Respondent discretion.162\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 318-322; Reply, \u00b6 95.\n\nTr. 13052013, 10:25-11:4.\n\n130.\n\nResponding to a question from the Tribunal, the Claimant stated at the hearing that the meaning of \"assent\" was different from the one of \"consent\".163 It does not seem, however, that Churchill drew any conclusion from this difference. It argued that \"[c]onsent exists without any further act required of Indonesia beyond the language of the treaties. Any other finding would fly in the face of common sense, ignore the undoubted intention of the drafters of both treaties and lead to palpably absurd results\".164\n\n\"To answer your question, is there a distinction between \"consent\" and \"assent\"? Yes, there is. There is a difference. \"Assent\" means something different\" (Tr. 14052013, 61:2-6). And the Claimant went on:  \n \"[Claimant:] Let's look at what assent means, as you have asked. Black's Law Dictionary, which we've already seen, it's on the record, \"assent\", agreement approval or permission, especially verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as willingness. The Oxford Dictionary of English, the expression of approval. There is, we say, a distinction, perhaps a fine one, but there is a distinction between \"assent\" and \"consent\". Verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as willingness will suffice.  \n [Tribunal:]. Are you saying that all assents are consents and not the other way around?  \n [Claimant:] At first blush, sir, that seems right, but I'd like to think about that question and come back to you, if I have anything further to add\".  \n It does not appear, however, that the Claimant drew conclusions from this difference (Tr. 14052013, 63:19-64:9).\n\nTr. 13052013, 9:20-25. *See also* : Mem., \u00b6 322; Reply, \u00b6 95.\n\n131.\n\nChurchill claims that its interpretation of \"shall assent\" is also supported by the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to create favorable conditions for investments by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State.165\n\nReply, \u00b6 100. UK-Indonesia BIT, *supra* note 84, (**Exh. ClA-18** ; **Exh. R-001**), preamble.\n\n132.\n\nSimilarly, relying on *Millicom*, the Claimant explains that Indonesia's interpretation is contrary to the \"clear intent\" of the drafters of the treaty.166 It is also irreconcilable with the obligation to interpret treaty provisions in good faith, which cannot permit \"a State to violate its treaty obligations at will\".167 Churchill further argues that, if a text has two possible meanings, then good faith interpretation \"requires the interpreter to prefer the \u2018better faith' interpretation consistent with the object and purpose of the treaty and the presumption that States mean what they say\" when ratifying a treaty.168\n\nReply, \u00b6 99.\n\nReply, \u00b6 100.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 29.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to substantiate its interpretation of the terms \"shall assent\" by relying on the *Millicom* decision.169 In that case, the arbitral tribunal was faced with a provision in the Netherlands-Senegal BIT similar to the one at issue here and held that nothing in the wording of the term \"shall assent\" would lead to the conclusion that such decision could be left to the discretion of the host State.170 It decided that the dispute settlement clause contained Senegal's unilateral offer of consent, which was accepted by the filing of the investor's request.\n\nMem., \u00b6\u00b6 323-324; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 96-99, n. 131 and 134.\n\n*Millicom*, *supra* note 115, \u00b6 63.\n\n134.\n\nRelying on explanatory notes of the Dutch Foreign Ministry on similar \"shall assent\" wording in various agreements entered into by the Netherlands,171 the Claimant argues that the UK-Indonesia BIT seeks to offer investors certainty in terms of recourse to arbitration.172\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 120-131.\n\nReply, \u00b6 124.\n\n2.4 Indonesia's reliance on the principle of contemporaneity is misleading\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Claimant stresses that the principle of contemporaneity must be applied with restraint, as it is not part of the rules on interpretation of the VCLT.173\n\nReply, \u00b6 103.\n\n136.\n\nIn any event, the interpretation of the terms \"shall assent\" proposed by the Claimant with regard to the UK-Indonesia BIT is consistent with the original will of the drafters in 1976. They intended to express in mandatory terms the certainty that investors would have access to ICSID proceedings.174\n\nReply, \u00b6 102.\n\n137.\n\nFurthermore, Indonesia's understanding of the principle of contemporaneity is misleading. The VCLT leaves the door open for evolutive interpretation so as to render the terms of a treaty effective in the light of changing circumstances.175\n\nReply, \u00b6 103.\n\n138.\n\nIn the present instance, the terms \"shall assent\" must be read bearing in mind subsequent practice; it must be interpreted \"within the framework of the entire legal system prevailing at the time of interpretation\", i.e. in essence the system of arbitration without privity.176 Proceeding in this manner could result in a departure from the original intent of the parties to the BIT.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 104-105.\n\n2.5 Indonesia's reliance on various commentators is erroneous\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nIndonesia's reliance on doctrinal writings which observe that there is a \"virtual unanimity\" among commentators about the interpretation of \"shall assent\" is \"misleading in its breadth and mistaken in its content\".177\n\nReply, \u00b6 113.\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimant starts by calling attention to the fact that Indonesia's interpretation of \"shall assent\" is not substantiated by any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* relating to Indonesia's own treaties.178 Nor do the commentators cited by Indonesia rely on preparatory materials relating to the negotiation or conclusion of the UK-Indonesia BIT.179\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\n141.\n\nChurchill further points out that most commentators referred to by Indonesia uncritically rely on Aron Broches' analysis, who himself cites nothing in support of his view. Subsequent authors have thus reproduced the same mistaken interpretation. Through a \"citation chain\" dating back to Broches,180 that interpretation has become \"conventional wisdom\". That wisdom is no evidence of the intent of the drafters.181\n\nReply, \u00b6 118.\n\nTr. 13052013, 11:7-11. The Claimant observes that the more recent authors on whom Indonesia relies have not taken into account *Millicom* and that Indonesia omitted to cite Andrew Newcombe and Lluis Paradell who acknowledge that the words \"shall assent\" are ambiguous (Reply, \u00b6119).\n\n2.6 Indonesia has provided its consent under the BKPM Approvals\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that the UK-Indonesia BIT requires an additional act of consent, Churchill argues that the Respondent has given such consent in the 2005 BKPM Approval. This consent was transferred to the Claimant upon its acquisition of PT ICD and through the 2006 BKPM Approval, which validated the acquisition of PT ICD and incorporated the 2005 BKPM Approval.\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's contention that the BKPM Approvals only extend to PT ICD and not to its shareholders. Relying on *Noble Energy v. Ecuador*, the Claimant disputes that the Respondent granted its consent only to PT ICD \"when the only manner in which that company could benefit from such consent would be under investment treaties [\u2026] to which it would resort by virtue of its foreign ownership\".182\n\nReply, \u00b6 156.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant further relies on *Amco v. Indonesia* and *Holiday Inns v. Morocco* for the proposition that a host State's consent contained in domestic instruments, such as contracts concluded with or licenses granted to local subsidiaries, extends to the foreign investors insofar as they carry out their obligations under the contract.183 The Claimant argues that it is the driving force behind PT ICD's activities and that it funded these activities allocating resources, contacts and expertise in developing the EKCP project. Therefore, it is \"reasonable to interpret the ICSID consent granted by the Respondent as intended to protect its rights as investor as well, especially since they overlap almost entirely with those of PT ICD\".184\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 157-158.\n\nReply, \u00b6 159. *See also* : C-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 21-27.\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimant also seeks support in the expert report of Dr. Makarim, who opines that the inclusion of ICSID dispute settlement clauses in the BKPM approvals is \"not standard\"185 and \"not at all consistent practice of BKPM\".186 In spite of a divergent practice, reference to ICSID dispute settlement was expressly included here and granted to a local company that was in foreign hands at 95% from its inception and at 100% since the Claimants' acquisition. For these reasons, Dr. Makarim is of the view that the \"deliberate insertion of the clause must be interpreted as the Government's intention to follow the [ICSID] Convention's dictates in settling disputes\".187\n\nReply, \u00b6 155; Makarim ER2, p. 10.\n\nReply, \u00b6 162.\n\nMakarim ER2, p. 10.\n\n146.\n\nWith regard to the wording of Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM Approval, the Claimant translates the Indonesian word *bersedia* as \"is willing\".188 On that basis, the Claimant submits that the \"shall assent\" requirement under the UK-Indonesia BIT is fulfilled.189 It also refutes the Respondent's allegation that the BKPM lacked authority to agree to ICSID arbitration, pointing to the fact that the BKPM Approval was copied to the President's office and various other Ministries.190 Had the BKPM overstepped its authority, the President would presumably have taken appropriate action.\n\nForeign Capital Investment Approval for PT ICD, Decision No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005 (with Certificate of Translation) (**Exh.

Analysis**\n---------------\n\n3.1 Consent to ICSID arbitration in general\n-------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires consent for the Parties to be bound to arbitrate under the ICSID regime. Several arbitral tribunals have taken the position that the expression of consent to ICSID arbitration must be \"clear and unambiguous\",192 or that consent must be proven through \"affirmative evidence\".193 Except for calling for a writing, the ICSID Convention contains no particular requirement of clarity or otherwise. Hence, the Tribunal will assess consent pursuant to the general rules on treaty interpretation.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v.

The United Kingdom ratified the VCLT on 25 June 1971. Indonesia has not ratified the VCLT.\n\n150.\n\nWhen interpreting the BIT and seeking to assess the common intention of the Contracting States, account must be taken of the special nature of investor-State arbitration, namely that the home State of the investor is not a party to the arbitration. It does not have the opportunity to present its views on the interpretation of \"its\" treaty nor to produce evidence in support, unlike the host State. This asymmetry inherent in investment treaty arbitration may justify recourse to the Tribunal's procedural powers under Rules 34 and 37 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n151.\n\nAccording to Article 31 VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". No special rule applies to the interpretation of a dispute settlement provision. Hence, such treaty provisions must be construed like any other, neither restrictively nor broadly. Or in the words of *Amco* :\n\n\"[L]ike any other convention, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively*, nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly or liberally*. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties; such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law\"196.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

In the end the question is what the relevant provisions mean, interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of interpretation of treaties. These are set out in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which for this purpose can be taken to reflect the position under customary law\").\n\n152.\n\nThe Parties concur, and rightly so, that the starting point for treaty interpretation is the text.197 The ordinary meaning of the text must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty's object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting States related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law binding the Contracting States.198\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties (1966), Art. 27 and 28, \u00b6 18, p. 220, par.

In *HICEE*, the tribunal noted that supplementary means are not a closed category.199\n\n*HICEE BV v. Slovak Republic*, Partial Award, 23 May 2011, \u00b6 117.\n\n3.3 Article 7 of the UK-Indonesia BIT\n-------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nArticle 7 of the UK-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national or company of the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment shall assent to any request on the part of such national or company to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any dispute that may arise in connection with the investment.\n\n(2) A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which immediately before such a dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party\".\n\n155.\n\nIndonesia submits that it has not consented to ICSID arbitration, and that Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT cannot be construed as a standing offer to arbitrate. It merely constitutes a promise to consent. Indonesia also submits that the BKPM Approvals do not express consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\nThe Tribunal will first determine whether the UK-Indonesia BIT contains a standing offer of ICSID arbitration and will only analyze whether the BKPM Approvals contain consent to ICSID arbitration if it reaches a negative conclusion in respect of the UK-Indonesia BIT.\n\n3.4 The ordinary meaning of the words \"shall assent\"\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIt is Indonesia's main contention that it did not \"assent\" to Churchill's Request for Arbitration, and that therefore this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. According to Indonesia, Article 7(1) contemplates a two-step process in which the foreign investor submits a request for arbitration and Indonesia then gives its consent.200 The natural and ordinary meaning of \"shall assent\" implies a future action.\n\nTr. 13052013, 134:11-16.\n\n157.\n\nIndonesia has not developed specific arguments on the meaning of \"assent\" and on the distinction between \"assent\" and \"consent\". Instead, Indonesia sought to ascertain the ordinary meaning of the words \"shall assent\" taken together. According to Indonesia, \"shall assent\" signifies that a separate, subsequent act of consent by the host State is called for each time a qualifying investor seeks to engage in ICSID arbitration. Article 7(1) only encompasses a promise to consent, a so-called *pactum de contrahendo*.\n\n158.\n\nIndonesia acknowledges that in principle it is required to grant its consent.201 It submits, however, that it is entitled to review on a case-by-case basis whether the jurisdictional requirements set in the treaty are fulfilled as a prerequisite for its decision to give consent. In particular, Indonesia argues that there is a link between Articles 7(1) and 2(1) of the treaty.202 Accordingly, it is required to give its consent only if it is established (after the filing of the request for arbitration) that the investment at issue was granted admission as required under Article 2(1) of the BIT. Since Churchill failed to conform to the requirements of Article 2(1), Indonesia is entitled to withhold its consent. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find that the Article 2(1) objection is ill-founded, the Tribunal would nevertheless lack jurisdiction, because Indonesia has not given its consent.203 In this context, Indonesia submits that the inter-State dispute settlement mechanism enshrined in Article 8 of the Treaty was specifically designed to address whether a host State is bound to grant its consent or whether it is justified to withhold it.204\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 187.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 186.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 66.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 65. *See also* : Tr. 13052013, 163:23-165:11.\n\n159.\n\nFor its part, Churchill argues that the formula \"shall assent\" in and of itself fulfills the requirement of consent by the host State under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. There is no further action required from the host State after the filing of the request for arbitration. The ordinary meaning of the word \"shall\" denotes a legally binding obligation. In other words, \"[f]ar from signifying an option, it is an expression of a mandatory obligation\".205 It was thus the clear intent of the treaty drafters to provide investors with the certainty of access to ICSID arbitration.\n\nReply, \u00b6 95.\n\n160.\n\nUntil the hearing, the Claimant seemed to assume that \"assent\" and \"consent\" were synonyms. Relying on various dictionary definitions, Churchill put forward that \"assent\" signifies \"verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as willingness\" or \"expression of approval\".206 Even at the hearing, the Claimant did not appear to draw clear-cut conclusions from the use of different words. Its arguments about this distinction rather concerned the question whether the BKPM Approvals contained an expression of consent.207 For the Claimant, were the Tribunal to find that an additional act is required under Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, such \"assent\" could readily be found in the BKPM approvals.\n\nTr. 14052013, 63:21-25.\n\nTr. 14052013, 62:17-63:4 and 63:19-64:4.\n\n161.\n\nA closer look at the Claimant's submissions reveals that, in reality, the Claimant has put forward two different lines of reasoning. The first one works on the assumption that Article 7(1) already encompasses the necessary advance consent, conceptualized as an offer to arbitrate, which is accepted by the investor when filing of the request for arbitration. In sum, the Claimant seems to argue that \"shall assent\" is the functional equivalent of \"hereby consents\" or of \"shall be bound to submit\".208 The Claimant's second line of reasoning assumes that the investor's request for arbitration contains the offer to arbitrate, which offer is automatically met by the consent of the host State without any need of further action by that State.209\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 42.\n\nMem., \u00b6 319. *See also* : Rejoinder, \u00b6 95; and Tr. 14052013, 26:10-13.\n\n162.\n\nThe core disagreement between the Parties hinges on the meaning of the words \"shall assent\". It is common ground, and rightly so, that the word \"shall\" implies an obligation. This would suggest that the submission to ICSID on the part of the Respondent is mandatory*.* The Tribunal tends to agree with the Claimant that, taken on its own, the word \"shall\" implies that there is no discretion on the part of the host State confronted with a request for arbitration. On the other hand, \"shall\" can also\u00a0be understood as implying a future action. In this sense, the use of the word \"shall\" does not necessarily imply automaticity in the achievement of the contemplated result.\n\n163.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that the Parties have not articulated any clear difference between \"assent\" and \"consent\". A review of relevant dictionaries does not allow one to identify the substance of the distinction, if any. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"assent\" as \"[a]greement, approval, or permission, esp. verbal or nonverbal conduct reasonably interpreted as willingness\".210 The definition refers back to consent. \"Consent\" is defined as \"[a]greement, approval or permission as to some act or purpose, esp. given voluntarily by a competent person; legally effective assent\".211\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary, 9th edition, 2009, p. 132.\n\n*Id.*, p. 346.\n\n164.\n\nGarner's Dictionary of Legal Usage indicates that the verbs assent, consent, accede, agree, acquiesce, subscribe share the sense \"to express a willingness to go along with someone else's wishes or views\". With regard to assent, the dictionary states that assent \"involves the intellect and applies to propositions or opinions\", whereas consent \"involves feelings or the will and connotes complying with a request\". The dictionary adds, \"[o]f course, one can assent or consent against one's better judgment\".212 Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law defines \"assent\" as follows: \"1. *v.* to agree to something esp. freely and with understanding: give one's assent; 2. *n.* agreement to a matter under consideration esp. based on freedom of choice and a reasonable knowledge of the matter\".213 It defines \"consent\" as follows: \"1. compliance in or approval of what is done or proposed by another; 2. agreement as to action or opinion\".214\n\nGarner's Dictionary of Legal Usage, 3rd edition, 2011, p. 85.\n\nMerriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, (Merriam-Webster, Springfield Mass., 1996), p. 34.\n\n*Id.*, p. 97.\n\n165.\n\nThese definitions do not allow one to draw a clear distinction between the two terms. Both \"consent\" and \"assent\" are manifestations indicating a willingness to engage in certain conduct or an agreement with a proposed opinion. It is true that \"consent\" is a term of foundational importance in the area of international dispute settlement. In the ICSID framework, disputing parties are required to \"consent in writing\" to ICSID arbitration. Accordingly, one might venture to say that, *prima facie* at least, assent may not suffice to create the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal.\n\n166.\n\nIn the same vein, the Tribunal tends to agree with the Respondent that the natural meaning of \"shall assent to any request\" seems to imply a certain time sequence. Indeed, this expression lends support to the view that the investor must first file a request and only thereafter will the host State \"assent\".\n\n167.\n\nA closer look to the consequences of the Parties' theses may be helpful. If one adopts one or the other of the Claimant's approach, it is clear that the Respondent's consent existed at the latest at the time of filing the request for arbitration.\n\n168.\n\nBy contrast, the consequences of Indonesia's interpretation give rise to a number of questions. Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT is unequivocal in that Indonesia committed itself to grant its assent. It indicates that the host State \"shall assent to any request\". The Tribunal understands this formulation as implying that, in one manner or another, a qualifying investor will have access to ICSID arbitration. However, under Indonesia's interpretation, even if this Tribunal were to hold that Indonesia has an obligation to consent, it could not enforce it as only the inter-State arbitral tribunal could determine whether Indonesia legitimately withheld its consent.\n\n169.\n\nThere are at least three main difficulties with this theory. First, there is no specific link between the investor-State and the inter-State arbitration clauses, none of which makes a cross-reference to the other. Second, even if an inter-State arbitral tribunal under Article 8 of the Treaty were to hold that Indonesia breached its obligation under Article 7(1), it is not clear to what extent Churchill could eventually have recourse to ICSID arbitration. If the inter-State tribunal considers that Indonesia was bound to give its assent upon the filing of Churchill's request for arbitration, that tribunal would not be in a position to procure Indonesia's missing consent. It could order specific performance. It would be left to Indonesia to abide by such order with the result that Churchill might remain without recourse to ICSID arbitration.\n\n170.\n\nThird, it is generally accepted that, in the ICSID framework, consent must exist on the day when the request for arbitration is filed.215 Indonesia's thesis that consent under Article 7(1) would by definition be provided *after* the filing of the request is at odds with this requirement. In sum, Indonesia's thesis raises difficulties which square badly with the categorical connotation of \"shall assent\".\n\nReport of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, \u00b6 24 [available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/StaticFiles/basicdoc/partB-section05.htm#02].\n\n171.\n\nTo conclude, the interpretation on the basis of the meaning of the words of the treaty is inconclusive, as two readings of the words \"shall assent\" are possible. The Tribunal will now review whether the context lends support to one reading rather than the other.\n\n3.5 The context surrounding the words \"shall assent\"\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nSeveral observations can be made on the context of the words \"shall assent\". First, Article 7 only provides for access to ICSID to the exclusion of other fora. Thus, on the international plane, the only possibility for Churchill to obtain redress is by gaining access to ICSID arbitration. Although not conclusive, this observation rather lends support to the investor's argumentation.\n\n173.\n\nSecond, Article 7(1) lacks any indication as to how Indonesia is to give its assent. If one assumes Indonesia's interpretation to be correct, i.e. that Indonesia must give its assent after the filing of a request, one would expect Article 7 to specify the modalities of such assent. This observation also seems to favor the Claimant's position.\n\n174.\n\nThird, Article 7(1) mandates the host State to assent to \"any request\". Indonesia argues that it has the discretion, albeit limited, to withhold its consent if the jurisdictional requirement contained in Article 2(1) is not met. While it will review the merits of Indonesia's objection based on Article 2(1) in the framework of Indonesia's second preliminary objection, it must determine now whether Indonesia can legitimately withhold its consent in light of the alleged link between Article 7(1) and Article 2(1). The plain words of Article 7(1) state that Indonesia \"shall assent\" to \"any request\". Article 7(1) contains no link to Article 2(1), nor does Article 2(1) refer to Article 7(1). In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept that Article 7(1) grants Indonesia discretion to assent or not depending on the assessment of the requirements set in Article 2(1). While Indonesia's objection under Article 2(1) may eventually be well-founded, it is not for Indonesia to make that determination at the level of its assent under Article 7, but for this Tribunal ruling on its jurisdiction.\n\n175.\n\nIn sum, the context surrounding the words \"shall assent\", while not decisive, rather favors Churchill's interpretation that it has a right to initiate ICSID arbitration.\n\n3.6 The object and purpose of the BIT\n-------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Indonesia's interpretation frustrates the object and purpose of the Treaty, which, in accordance with the preamble, is to \"create favourable conditions for [...] investments by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State\".216\n\nPreamble of the UK-Indonesia BIT, *supra* note 84, (**Exh. CLA-18** ; **Exh. R-001**). *See* Reply, \u00b6 100.\n\n177.\n\nFor its part, Indonesia argues that the mere adherence to a bilateral investment treaty does not automatically commit the Contracting States to provide optimal and maximum security to foreign investors.217 In this regard, Indonesia puts forward that a \"State may balance the policy of encouraging investment by investors of the other State party to the BIT with other policies or considerations, one of which may be to preserve the ability to avoid ICSID arbitration of disputes relating to investments outside the protection of the BIT in question\".218 In any event, Indonesia contends that an interpretation based on the object and purpose of a treaty cannot go against the plain language of a treaty.219\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 154.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 155, 174; Rejoinder, \u00b6 17.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the object and purpose of the treaty is neutral for present purposes. The preamble of the UK-Indonesia BIT states that the United Kingdom and Indonesia strive \"to create favourable conditions for greater economic co-operation between them and in particular for investments by nationals and companies of one State in the territory of the other State\".220 The preamble further provides that both States recognize \"that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international agreement of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of individual business initiative and will increase prosperity in both States\".221 In other words, the preamble refers to both the private interests of the investor as well as the public interests of the State. It is thus of little assistance in the present context.\n\nUK-Indonesia BIT, *supra* note 84, (**Exh. CLA-18** ; **Exh. R-001**), preamble.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n179.\n\nAt this juncture, the result of the Tribunal's analysis can be summarized as follows. First, for the reasons stated above, the ordinary meaning of \"shall assent\" is unclear. Second, the context rather supports Churchill's interpretation, without however delivering a fatal blow to Indonesia's interpretation. Third, the object and purpose of the BIT is of no avail in the present dispute.\n\n180.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal cannot but find that the meaning of \"shall assent\" is unclear or ambiguous. Consequently, it will now review any relevant supplementary means of interpretation pursuant to Article 32 VCLT. In doing so, it will conduct a review of cases and scholarly writings which it had not covered in the first step of the analysis to better focus on the treaty's intrinsic elements.\n\n3.7 Supplementary means of interpretation\n-----------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nArticle 32 VCLT allows recourse to the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances surrounding the treaty's conclusion. It does not give an exhaustive list of admissible materials and the Tribunal thus has latitude to include any element capable of shedding light on the interpretation of \"shall assent\".\n\n182.\n\nSince the Respondent has put most emphasis on doctrinal writings and the Claimant on case law, the Tribunal will address these materials first. Accordingly, the analysis will focus on (i) doctrinal writings, (ii) case law, (iii) the treaty practice of Indonesia and the United Kingdom with third States, and (iv) the preparatory materials regarding the negotiation of the UK-Indonesia BIT.\n\n3.7.1 Doctrinal writings on \"shall assent\"\n------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nIndonesia filed a number of doctrinal writings222 showing virtual unanimity in support of Indonesia's interpretation of the \"shall assent\" clause.223 It stresses that the first author to comment upon a \"shall assent\" clause was Aron Broches, the father of the ICSID Convention. In 1982, he wrote that the \"shall assent\" clause of the 1968 Netherlands-Indonesia Economic Cooperation Treaty \"would not [\u2026] by itself, enable the investor to institute proceedings before the Centre\" and that \"[a] request to that effect would presumably be rejected by the Secretary-General of the Centre\".224 He also stated that if the host State refused to give its consent once asked, the home State could resort to remedies available under the treaty or other rules of international law.225\n\n*See* the references with excerpts, *supra* notes 127 and 128.\n\nIn addition to those referred to expressly in the following paragraphs, Indonesia also relies on Rudolf Dolzer & Christoph Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 258 (**Exh.

CLA-105**).\n\n185.\n\nFor its part, Churchill asserts that none of these authors engages in an in-depth analysis of \"shall assent\" clauses, mostly relying on previous publications. According to Churchill, these authors can all be placed in a single \"citation chain\" that one can trace back to Broches citing nothing in support of his opinion. Churchill also notes that the recent decision in *Millicom v. Senegal*, to which we will revert, has led certain observers to be less assertive about the meaning of \"shall assent\". For instance, Dolzer and Schreuer, while sticking to the conventional wisdom, have in fact uncritically taken notice of the *Millicom* decision. Commenting on Article 11 of the Netherlands-Indonesia treaty of 1968, Newcombe and Paradell are of the view that the meaning of \"shall assent\" is not as clear-cut as most doctrinal writings make it to be and that \"[t]he effect of the article is unclear\".229\n\nAndrew Newcombe & Lluis Paradell, *Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment,* (2009), p. 44, n. 264 (**Exh. CLA-111**).\n\n186.\n\nDoctrinal writings may indeed provide guidance on the state of the law (Article 38(1)(d) of the ICJ Statute) and it is self-evident that an opinion grounded on thorough research and rigorous reasoning is more likely to influence the interpretative process than one that is not. Bearing this in mind, it is striking that the doctrinal opinions invoked by Indonesia essentially rely on previous writings and refer to Broches and Schreuer (who himself cites Broches) and quote similar provisions in various BITs.\n\n187.\n\nTo mention only the most authoritative here, Broches, who appears to have been the first to address the \"shall assent\" clause, only seeks support in similar provisions in other Dutch and English BITs; he does not refer to any documents emanating from the Contracting States eliciting the intention of the drafters.230 Schreuer too merely reviews Article 10 of the 1988 Netherlands-Pakistan BIT, refers to similar provisions in other BITs, and cites to Broches and Dolzer & Stevens.231 Chester Brown and Audley Sheppard232 contrast the \"shall assent\" clause of the UK-Indonesia BIT with the 1972 UK Model dispute settlement clause by referring to the official commentary on the UK Model BIT.233 They do not engage in a more detailed discussion of the UK-Indonesia BIT and do not refer to materials or arguments to establish the intent of the Contracting States.\n\nWith regard to the Netherlands BITs, and in addition to the 1968 Netherlands-Indonesia BIT, Broches refers to the 1971 Netherlands-Morocco BIT, the 1971 Netherlands-Ivory Coast BIT, the 1972 Netherlands-Singapore BIT, the 1974 Netherlands-Korea BIT, and the 1976 Netherlands-Egypt BIT. With regard to the United Kingdom BITs, Broches refers to the 1976 UK-Indonesia BIT and the 1980 UK-Philippines BIT. Finally, Broches mentions the 1977 Japan-Egypt BIT. *See* Aron Broches, \u2018Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties and Arbitration of Investment Disputes', in: Jan C.

In spite of this difference, the reasoning of the *Millicom* tribunal is interesting. While it accepts that the wording is \"not unequivocal\", the Tribunal focuses on its mandatory nature (\"devra\" and not \"pourra\") and considers that \"in spite of the wording of the rule, Senegal's ratification of the Accord entails consent to the ICSID arbitration system\".235 It \"does not see why it would be necessary [...], to adopt a two-step procedure pursuant to which, before submitting a request, the party intending to act would have to request authorization from the Contracting State which it would have no right to refuse, unless otherwise specifically stated\".236\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 63.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n193.\n\nThe *Millicom* tribunal then confirms its understanding by reference to the origin237 and the \"spirit\" of the rule. Under this latter heading, it notes that \"the purpose of a treaty such as that in question is indeed to guarantee efficient and full protection. This purpose is made clear, in particular, by Articles 3 and 4 of the Accord, whose objective is \u2018s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9grale' (\"full security\") (Article 4, paragraph 1). Such objective, however, cannot be truly attained unless investors, the primary beneficiaries of the protection, dispose of legal means enabling them to obtain compliance therewith\".238\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 64 (\"The former Article 5 *ter* of the *Accord de 1965 sur la coop\u00e9ration \u00e9conomique* (as amended in 1972) provided for a moral obligation only that the text of Article 10 of the Accord has elevated to a legal obligation. This rule undoubtedly primarily establishes an inter-State obligation [\u2026], but there is no reason why the establishment by the new rule of its mandatory nature could not be extended to investors, who are precisely those for whom the provision concerning the resolution of disputes is intended\").\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 65.\n\n194.\n\nWhile this Tribunal is certainly prepared to pay due regard to earlier decisions, it does not believe that *Millicom* is of much assistance here. Indeed, it does not reveal how it followed the process of interpretation outlined in the Vienna Convention.\n\n3.7.3 Treaties with third States\n--------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nTreaties on the same subject matter concluded respectively by the United Kingdom and Indonesia with third States can legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary means of interpretation. For instance, in *Oil Platforms*, the ICJ had recourse to treaties concluded by one disputing party with third States dealing with the same subject-matter.239 This approach also found resonance in investment treaty arbitration, for example in *AAPL*240 or in *Plama.*241\n\n*Oil Platforms* (*Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America*), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1996 (\" *Oil Platforms* \"), \u00b6\u00b6 29, 47. *See also* : Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1952, pp. 191-192 (**Exh. CLA-146**).\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, 27 June 1990 (\" *AAPL* \"), \u00b6 40 (**Exh. cLa-145**).\n\n*Plama, supra* note 192, \u00b6 195 (**Exh. CLA-130**).\n\n196.\n\nPrior to the hearing, the Parties had filed a selection of BITs of either the United Kingdom or Indonesia and third parties. To gain a complete view of potential treaty patterns for its decision, the Tribunal drew up a tentative table containing the dispute settlement clauses entered into by the United Kingdom and Indonesia with third parties. It circulated that table for the Parties' comments in two rounds of post-hearing submissions.\n\n197.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal will now pursue its interpretation of the words \"shall assent\" in Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT. In doing so, it does not mean to make any finding on the existence of consent to arbitration in the third party treaties. It limits itself to a *prima facie* analysis of such treaties and expresses an opinion on the UK-Indonesia BIT only.\n\n198.\n\nAccording to publicly available information, the United Kingdom signed 102 BITs, of which 94 have entered into force. Broadly speaking, one discerns four categories:\n\n\u2022 In the first category, 53 BITs give the investor access to ICSID arbitration. Out of these, 49 BITs give only access to ICSID,242 while three others provide that, if one of the States is not a member of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility mechanism or UNCITRAL arbitration is available.243 The last BIT provides that, unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, ICSID is the default procedure.244\n\nThe vast majority of these 53 BITs follows the first UK model clause of 1972, whereby each Contracting State \"hereby consents\" to submit any dispute to ICSID.245 The others use similar wording. In the UK-Mexico BIT, each Contracting State gives its \"unconditional consent\" to ICSID arbitration. In the UK-Romania BIT, the investor \"shall be entitled to submit\" the dispute to ICSID. In the UK-Chile BIT, the investor \"may submit\" the dispute to ICSID. In the UK-Costa Rica BIT, the Contracting States also consented to ICSID arbitration (\"consciente en someter\"). In the UK-Venezuela BIT, the investor \"may choose to refer\" the dispute to ICSID, if available. In the UK-India BIT, any dispute \"may be referred\" to ICSID, if available.\n\n\u2022 The second category includes 46 BITs that provide for UNCITRAL arbitration as the default procedure. Most of these BITs follow the second UK model clause, whereby the disputing parties \"may agree\" to submit their dispute to ICSID.246 However, in the absence of an agreement, the investor has the right to initiate UNCITRAL proceedings.247 Others allow an investor to choose several arbitral mechanisms to the exclusion of ICSID,248 while still others provide advance consent for UNCITRAL only.249\n\n\u2022 The third category is composed of the UK-Indonesia BIT and the UK-Philippines BIT.250 Both BITs indicate that the host State \"shall assent\" to ICSID arbitration.\n\n\u2022 The fourth category comprises only the 1978 UK-Thailand BIT, which contains no investor-State dispute settlement provision.\n\nUK-Egypt BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Singapore BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Republic of Korea BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Jordan BIT, Art. 6; UK-Sri Lanka BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Senegal BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Bangladesh BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Lesotho BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Papua New Guinea BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Malaysia BIT, Art. 7(1); UK-Yemen BIT, Art. 7; UK-Cameroon BIT, Art. 8(1); UK-Costa Rica BIT, Art.

Under the UK-Romania BIT, the qualifying investor can only submit a dispute to ICSID relating to the amount of compensation due. The UK-Zimbabwe BIT did not enter into force.\n\nUK-India BIT, Art. 9(3); UK-Georgia, Art. 8; UK-Venezuela, Art. 8(2).\n\nUK-Colombia BIT, Art. IX.

X(1).\n\n199.\n\nThe foregoing description shows that the United Kingdom seems to follow a consistent policy of securing access to international arbitration for their investors. In 99 cases out of 102 the relevant dispute settlement clauses enshrine an expression of consent.\n\n200.\n\nAs regards the United Kingdom's treaty practice at the time of the conclusion of the UK-Indonesia BIT in 1976, the description above shows that the first optional model clause containing the \"hereby consents\" language is replicated in several BITs concluded during the 1970s, while the second optional model clause is employed for the first time in 1982.\n\n201.\n\nFrom the information on record, the United Kingdom signed its first BIT, the UK-Egypt BIT, on 24 February 1975, followed on 22 July 1975 by the signature of the UK-Singapore BIT, and on 4 March 1976 with the signature of the UK-Korea BIT. All these BITs employ the unequivocal \"hereby consents\" language. These three BITs precede the signature of the UK-Indonesia BIT, which took place on 27 April 1976. Finally, the United Kingdom signed a BIT with Thailand in 1978 with no dispute settlement provision for investor-State arbitration; and on 10 October 1979 the United Kingdom signed a BIT with Jordan again employing the \"hereby consents\" language.\n\n202.\n\nTurning now to the analysis of Indonesia's treaty practice, the information on record shows that Indonesia signed 64 BITs,251 49 of which are in force. In addition, Indonesia concluded an economic cooperation agreement with the Netherlands in 1968, which is the only other agreement entered into by Indonesia containing the \"shall assent\" language. Indonesia also concluded a BIT with Australia which contains the wording \"shall consent in writing [\u2026] within 45 days\", a provision directly relevant to ICSID arbitration ARB/12/40.\n\nIn its first post-hearing submission, Churchill provided the Tribunal with a list of 58 BITs concluded by Indonesia, out of which 50 are publicly available. In addition, Churchill referred to the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area. *Cf.* C-PHB1, Annex 1. Indonesia provided the Tribunal, together with its first post-hearing brief, with a list of 64 BITs, including the text of all investor-State dispute settlement clauses (**Exh. R-111**).\n\n203.\n\nThe tables provided by the Parties in response to the Tribunal's listings show 25 different formulations indicating Indonesia's advance consent to international arbitration:\n\na. \"hereby consents to submit\";252\n\nb. \"hereby consents to the submission\";253\n\nc. \"hereby gives its unconditional consent\";254\n\nd. \"hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic] gives its consent\";255\n\ne. \"hereby irrevocably consents in advance\";256\n\nf. \"irrevocably consents in advance\";257\n\ng. \"agrees in advance and irrevocably\";258\n\nh. \"the investor may refer\";259\n\ni. \"the investor may submit\";260\n\nj. \"the investor affected may submit\";261\n\nk. \"the investor concerned may submit\";262\n\nl. \"the investor in question may submit\";263\n\nm. \"the investor will be entitled to submit\";264\n\nn. \"the investor shall be entitled to refer\";265\n\no. \"the dispute may be submitted\";266\n\np. \"the dispute can be submitted\";267\n\nq. \"the dispute shall, at the request of the investor be submitted\";268\n\nr. \"the dispute shall, at the request of the investor concerned, be submitted\";269\n\ns. \"the dispute shall, at the request of the investor of the other Contracting Party, be submitted\";270\n\nt. \"the dispute shall be submitted\";271\n\nu. \"it may be submitted\";272\n\nv. \"such disputes may be submitted\";273\n\nw. \"it shall be at the request of the investor filed\";274\n\nx. \"it shall, upon request of the investor, be submitted\";275\n\ny. \"either party to the dispute may institute\".276\n\nIndonesia-Turkmenistan BIT, Art.

IX(2).\n\nIndonesia-Tunisia BIT, Art. 10(2).\n\n204.\n\nThus, in at least 60 out of 64 BITs, Indonesia has given its advance consent.277 This list does not include the UK-Indonesia and the Australia-Indonesia BITs in dispute here. It does not include the Indonesia-France BIT either as it mandates the inclusion of consent in the investment approval documentation.278 Finally, the only BIT entered into by Indonesia and still in force, which unequivocally lacks a standing offer to arbitrate, is the Indonesia-Switzerland BIT containing no investor-State dispute settlement provision at all.\n\nIt is to be noted that 15 out of these 60 BITs have not entered into force.\n\nIndonesia-France BIT, Art. 3 *cum* Art. 2.\n\n205.\n\nMore specifically in relation to BITs concluded in or around the 1970s, i.e. the decade of the BIT under review, the first investor-State dispute settlement clause entered into by Indonesia is contained in the 1968 economic cooperation agreement with the Netherlands. It employs the \"shall assent\" language and refers to ICSID arbitration. In the same year, Indonesia concluded BITs with Germany and Denmark, none of which provided for investor-State arbitration.279\n\nIt is to be noted that Indonesia has renegotiated its treaties with these three States, each time providing for an unequivocal expression of consent (\"hereby consent\"). In 1994 with the Netherlands (\"hereby consent\"); in 2003 with Germany (\"it shall, at the request of the investor of the other Contracting Party, be submitted\"); and in 2007, with Denmark (\"hereby consents\").\n\n206.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Indonesia concluded only four BITs. The first one, the Indonesia-Belgium BIT, provides that each Contracting State \"hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic] gives its consent\" to ICSID arbitration.280 The second BIT, with France, mandates Indonesia to include a standing consent to ICSID arbitration in the investment approval, thus implying that the BIT itself does not encompass advance consent.281 The third BIT, with Switzerland contains no dispute settlement provision at all; and the fourth BIT was the UK-Indonesia BIT.\n\nIndonesia-Belgium BIT, Art. 10.\n\nIndonesia-France BIT, Art. 3.\n\n207.\n\nTo sum up, the United Kingdom's practice is to secure advance consent to international arbitration, including during the 1970s. Indonesia follows a similar practice but clauses adopted in the 1970s show considerable variations. As a result, third party treaty practice does not allow one to reach a conclusion on the meaning of \"shall assent\" thus leading the Tribunal to review the preparatory materials that are on the record.\n\n3.7.4 Preparatory materials\n---------------------------\n\n208.\n\nNeither Party has put any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* into evidence prior to the hearing. Churchill mostly relied on explanatory notes eliciting the Dutch government's understanding of \"shall assent\" clauses which that government concluded with third parties.282 Upon a question from the Tribunal the Parties indicated that they had tried to locate *travaux* of the UK-Indonesia BIT, but had been unsuccessful.283\n\nThe Claimant provided the Tribunal with three Explanatory Notes relating respectively to the Netherlands-Indonesia BIT signed in 1994, the Netherlands-Philippines BIT signed in 1985, and the Netherlands-Pakistan BIT signed in 1988. *See* Explanatory Note to the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia on the Advancement and Protection of Investments, with Protocol, 3 February 1995, (**Exh. C-356**) ; Explanatory Note to the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of the Philippines for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 29 November 1985, (**Exh. C-357**) ; Explanatory Note to the Agreement on Economic Cooperation and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 31 March 1989, (**Exh. C-358**).\n\nTr. 14052013, 17:10-18:13.\n\n209.\n\nIn the course of the deliberation, the Tribunal became aware through a press article of the award on jurisdiction rendered in *Rizvi*, the first case directly dealing with the UK-Indonesia BIT.284 Since the award had not been published, the Tribunal invited Indonesia to circulate that decision with the understanding that the content would be kept confidential. It appeared that in *Rizvi* Indonesia filed the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the British Government.\n\n*Rafat Ali Rizvi v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/13, Award on Jurisdiction, 16 July 2013 (\" *R/'zv/* \") (**Exh. RLA-108** ; **Exh. CLA-140**).\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore informed the Parties that it envisaged to requesting preparatory materials from the United Kingdom pursuant to Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. While Indonesia objected to this course of action, Churchill advised the Tribunal that it had engaged in new research and located the relevant materials. It filed these materials with its first post-hearing submission, and both Parties then commented on them.\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the preparatory materials reveal that \"neither the British nor the Indonesian side intended for the term \u2018shall assent' to have any effect different from that of the United Kingdom Model BIT of that time\", and that the *travaux* \"confirm that the treaty negotiators intended and believed the \u2018shall assent' language to comprise a binding and effective offer to arbitrate disputes before ICSID\".285 For its part, Indonesia avers that Churchill is unable to point to a single document proving that the phrase \"shall assent\" reflects a standing consent to ICSID arbitration,286 and that Churchill's reading of the materials is \"deeply flawed because it imputes to the negotiators a state of mind based upon the benefit of hindsight\".287\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 88.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 52.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 56.\n\n212.\n\nThe British materials contain four folders from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office archives.288 They are mainly composed of internal notes and drafts of British officials and counter-drafts submitted by Indonesia. With respect to Article 7 of the BIT, the materials contain no exchanges of notes or similar documents clearly depicting a common understanding. The Tribunal nevertheless believes that it may draw some useful indications from these materials, both of the intentions of the British negotiators and of Indonesia. With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal now embarks upon a closer analysis of these *travaux*.\n\nExh. C-362 to C-365.\n\n213.\n\nNegotiations between the United Kingdom and Indonesia took place in 1974 and 1975. The principal negotiators on the British side were Messrs. Desmond Kerr of the Financial Relations Department and Anthony Aust from the Office of Legal Adviser of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and on the Indonesian side Messrs. Ferdy Salim, Director for International Trade Relations, and Sanadji, Head of Administration Division, Directorate of Investment and Finance.\n\n214.\n\nIt appears that the British Government initiated contacts with Indonesia and proposed a draft agreement. In that proposal, the investor-State dispute settlement provision replicated the optional model clause of the 1972 UK Model BIT, that is the standard \"hereby consents\" language.289\n\nUnited Kingdom, FCO, Model Investment Protection Agreement, 7 July 1972 (**Exh. CLA-160**).\n\n215.\n\nOn 11 March 1974, Indonesia provided a counter-draft to Article 7, which read as follows:\n\n\"The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national of the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment, shall assent to any demand on the part of such national and any such national shall comply with any request of the former Contracting Party, to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, any dispute that may arise in connection with the investment\".290\n\nPreparatory Materials FCO 59/1190, at 101 (**Exh. C-363**).\n\n216.\n\nIn June 1974, the two main British negotiators, Messrs. Kerr and Aust, exchanged comments on the Indonesian counter-draft. Their observations essentially focus on Indonesia's attempt to introduce some sort of reciprocity in the disputing parties' possibility to initiate ICSID arbitration. Mr. Kerr thus wrote:\n\n\"The Indonesians have redrafted the Article. Their text is shorter but more importantly it now contains a new provision; i.e. an investor must assent to a demand by the host Government to submit a dispute to ICSID. The new provision is unacceptable because HMG cannot force a UK investor to accept arbitration or conciliation by ICSID. Additionally we should point out to the Indonesians that the text of the UK Article 7 has been approved by the Centre and indeed is based on ICSID's own model arbitration clauses\".291\n\nPreparatory Materials FCO 59/1190, at 58-59 (**Exh. C-363**).\n\n217.\n\nA few months later, in November 1974, Indonesia submitted a second counter-proposal, in which Article 7 read as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic] gives its consent to submit to conciliation and arbitration any dispute relating to a measure contrary to this Agreement, pursuant to the Convention of Washington of 18 March 1965, to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes at the initiative of a national or legal person of the other Contracting Party, who considers himself to have been affected by such a measure.\n\nThis consent implies renunciation of the requirement that the internal administrative or judicial resorts should be exhausted\".292\n\nPreparatory Materials FCO 59/1191, at 26 (**Exh. C-364**).\n\n218.\n\nThis second counter proposal was accompanied by (i) a copy of the UK Model BIT dispute settlement clause with the \"hereby consents\" language,293 and (ii) a copy of the Indonesia-Belgium BIT containing a nearly identical dispute settlement provision to the one submitted by Indonesia in its second proposal.294\n\nPreparatory Materials FCO 59/1191, at 27 (**Exh.

They would be prepared to amend that Article to provide for references of disputes to ICSID for settlement by conciliation and by arbitration, but they would be reluctant to relinquish their original wording which was agreed by ICSID (and recently accepted by the Singapore Government). They would appreciate an explanation of the intention behind the Indonesian proposal and its reconsideration in the light of these comments\".296\n\nTelegram from Mr. Kerr to Mr. Torry (United Kingdom Embassy, Jakarta), 29 November 1974, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1191, at 17 (**Exh.

As regards Article 8 of the revised model Agreement, the position is that we have agreed to provide for conciliation by ICSID when the other Government with which we are negotiating wants this. But we have not so far done the necessary drafting and I should be grateful for your advice on how we should tackle this.\n\n3. I have made some draft manuscript amendments to the existing version of Article 8 to provide for conciliation as well as arbitration. I should be grateful for your comments on these suggested amendments. I would also value your views whether it would not both be better and simpler to totally change this Article and replace it by a much shorter Article on the lines of that which appears in the 1968 Netherlands Agreement with Indonesia. This reads:\n\n\"The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national or the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment, shall assent to any demand on the part of such national and any such national shall comply with any request of the former Contracting Party, to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, any dispute that may arise in connection with the investment\".\n\n4. I incline myself to prefer this shorter version. Certainly the Indonesians are mystified by our present version which seems to them to suffer from reproducing too much of the content of the Washington Convention. We are at the moment arguing for the retention of our present version, but I am not at all sure that we are wise to do so. Would we lose anything were we to substitute the precise language of the Netherlands Agreement with Indonesia?\"297\n\nTelegram from Mr. Kerr to Ms. Densa (Legal Advisers Office), 12 February 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 172 (**Exh. C-362**). The following day, Mr. Kerr forwarded Indonesia's second draft proposal to Ms. Densa, commenting that \"[t]he English is a little odd but the sense is clear\" and adding that \"there might be some advantage in attempting to add to it the second and last sentences of our wording of Article 8(1)\" dealing with standing of locally incorporated but foreign-controlled companies. *See* Telegram from Mr. Kerr to Ms. Densa (Legal Advisers Office), 13 February 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 171 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\n221.\n\nSeveral other internal notes discuss various points of contention raised by Indonesia with respect to the draft dispute settlement provision. For instance, Mr. Kerr wrote to Mr. Crowson in Jakarta on 13 June 1975 that the British Government was actively considering agreeing to Indonesia's request to include a reference to conciliation:\n\n\"This revision makes provision for conciliation as well as arbitration, which is something on which the Indonesians were keen. If you were to pass this on it might serve the purpose of showing the Indonesians that we are doing our best to meet their points. The revised Article has been agreed with ICSID\".298\n\nTelegram from Mr. Kerr to Mr. Crowson (British Embassy, Jakarta), 13 June 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 167 (**Exh. C-362**). On the question of the inclusion of a reference to conciliation, *see also* the comments of the Financial Relations Department of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office: Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 142 and 148 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\n222.\n\nOn the eve of the in-person negotiations on 29 September 1975, Indonesia, through Mr. Salim, submitted a third counter proposal, mirroring its first one, which in pertinent part read as follows:\n\n\"The Department would like to propose a version which it has with other countries such as the Netherlands instead of using the longer version of the UK's draft. It reads as follows:\n\n\"The Contracting Party in the territory of which a national of the other Contracting Party makes or intends to make an investment, shall assent to any demand on the part of such national and any such national shall comply with any request of the former Contracting Party, to submit, for conciliation or arbitration, to the Centre established by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965 any dispute that may arise in connection with the investment\".299\n\nTelegram from Mr. Salim to Mr. Crowson (British Embassy, Jakarta), 29 September 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 127 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\n223.\n\nMr. Kerr's response to Mr. Salim regarding the latest proposal reads as follows:\n\n\"This Article should deal both with the cases of nationals and companies. We would insert the words \u2018or company' after \u2018national' in the first two cases where the word occurs. We are, however, doubtful whether we can agree that nationals or companies should be obliged to refer disputes to ICSID upon the volition of the Contracting Parties. We wish to discuss this point. We do not think this requirement appears in other Agreements, nor, as far as we are aware, do we have authority to commit British nationals or companies in this sense.\n\nWe also propose the reinstatement of the second sentence of the United Kingdom draft which would cover the cases of locally-incorporated companies in Indonesia or the United Kingdom where the majority of the shares were owned by the nationals of the other State, as envisaged in the ICSID Convention. Without this provision, in view of the requirements of the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967, the Article could not be invoked in respect of an approved investment in Indonesia\".300\n\nTelegram from Mr. Kerr to Mr. Salim, 29 September 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 117-118 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\n224.\n\nNegotiations then took place in Jakarta between 29 September and 3 October 1975.301 Following the initialing of the authentic text, an internal British note reported that on balance the result of the negotiations was satisfactory.302 More specifically, it stated:\n\n\"2. The Agreement with Indonesia differs a little in its Articles 2, 4, 7 and 8 from the Agreements with Singapore and Egypt. [\u2026]\n\n21. The Indonesians insisted on the short version of this Article which appears in the first paragraph. This is similar to that adopted in their Agreements with other Western European countries. We argued the toss on this for a little time but spent most effort on securing the second paragraph of the Article which *will enable British majority shareholders in locally-incorporated companies in Indonesia* (almost all our investment being in this category) *to refer disputes with Indonesia to ICSID*. Because companies are defined in Article 1 in terms of their place of incorporation, it was essential to obtain this if the Article were to be capable of application. A very long time was spent on this point and we were obliged at one stage, when the Indonesians objected that none of our European colleagues had either requested or obtained such a provision, to describe the ICSID Articles in their Agreements as meaningless since they did not give ICSID jurisdiction in the case of foreign-controlled locally-incorporated companies. The point went home, and this was the final major matter to be covered in the negotiation\".\n\n\"The balance of the Agreement as a whole is satisfactory to us. It gives our investors assurance of the future admission of their investment to Indonesia, its equitable treatment there and fair compensation in the event of expropriation. It provides a sound framework within which further investment can take place and affords adequate protection for approved existing and future investment\".303\n\nReport on the United Kingdom-Indonesia BIT, October 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 8-14 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\n*Id*, at 14 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\nReport on United Kingdom-Indonesia BIT, October 1975, Preparatory Materials FCO 59/1292, at 9, 11-13 (**Exh. C-362**).\n\n225.\n\nThis review shows several crucial elements at odds with Indonesia's argument. First, Indonesia submitted three drafts of the investor-State dispute settlement provision. The first and third replicated the dispute settlement provision which Indonesia had concluded with the Netherlands in 1968, while the second reproduced the clause agreed with Belgium in 1970. Interestingly, Indonesia's second draft contained a proposal of unconditional advance consent to ICSID arbitration, i.e. \"hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic] gives its consent\". While it is true that the final text does not contain the unequivocal formula of the second draft, the fact that Indonesia made a proposal of such content demonstrates that it had no difficulty giving English investors unconditional access to ICSID arbitration.\n\n226.\n\nSecond, Indonesia's first and third drafts contain an element of reciprocity which was contentious. The draft provides that each Contracting State \"shall assent\" to any request coming from the foreign investor and that the latter \"shall comply\" with any request coming from the host State to submit to ICSID arbitration. The British negotiators could not accept that formulation because they felt that the State cannot force its citizens to accept arbitration. That divergence hinged on the *investor's* not the State's consent.\n\n227.\n\nThird, Indonesia objected to the 1972 UK model clause because it did not provide for conciliation. It insisted on the inclusion of conciliation in the dispute settlement clause. The United Kingdom apparently modified its model clause in 1975 and added conciliation. Here again, the divergence had nothing to do with the host State's consent.\n\n228.\n\nFourth, the real stumbling block in the negotiations did not turn on standing consent, but on the right for locally incorporated investment vehicles under foreign control to initiate ICSID arbitration in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It is difficult to envisage that the negotiators would have fought for and against this right had they thought that its very existence was conditional on the will of the respondent State.\n\n229.\n\nAs the Claimant puts it \"[i]f Article 7 in the First Counter-Draft had required an additional act of consent, the British negotiators should have considered the proposed Article 7 in the Second Counter-Draft as a positive step towards the binding consent established under the United Kingdom Model BIT, and one would have expected a favourable or congratulatory remark of the negotiators\".304 Yet, the British negotiators do not appear to have considered the \"shall assent\" in the first counter-draft to be a step backwards compared to the British model clause. Nor did they regard the \"hereby irrevocably and anticipatory [sic] gives its consent\" language of the second counter-draft as a step forward or the return to \"shall assent\" in the third counter-proposals as a new step back. The materials show that these changes were regarded as indifferent. While the preparatory materials on record may not be complete, the same indifference appears to have existed among Indonesia's negotiators. They were mainly concerned because (i) the British proposal was too long and reproduced too many elements mentioned in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and (ii) no conciliation was provided. There is no trace of an intent to grant consent on a case-by-case basis, let alone to institute a so-called two-step procedure as presently alleged by the Respondent. They apparently had no difficulty proposing wording expressly providing unconditional consent. Nor did they seem to oppose shifting back and forth from explicitly unconditional language to the \"shall assent\" clause. In the exchange with Mr. Kerr on the eve of the meeting in Jakarta, Mr. Salim says nothing about \"shall assent\" being different from Indonesia's second counter-draft or from the British draft.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 98\n\n230.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the treaty drafters considered the \"shall assent\" language as functionally equivalent to \"hereby consents\" or similar wording. Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that Indonesia has given its advance consent to arbitrate the dispute presently before it.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n231.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Article 7(1) contains a standing offer to arbitrate any dispute that may arise in connection with an investment before ICSID. Churchill was therefore entitled to submit its Request for Arbitration directly to the Centre and no further act was required from Indonesia for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction.\n\n232.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal mentions that it would also have found consent to ICSID arbitration in the BKPM Approvals, had it held, *quod non*, that an additional expression of consent was required under the BIT.\n\n233.\n\nSection IX(4) the 2005 BKPM approval, as translated by the Claimant, reads as follows:\n\n\"In the event of a dispute between the company and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia that cannot be resolved by consensus, the Government of Indonesia [is] willing to follow the settlement according to the provisions of the Convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign Citizen regarding investments in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968\".305\n\nForeign Capital Investment Approval for PT ICD, Decision No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (with Certificate of Translation) (**Exh. C-17**).\n\n234.\n\nIndonesia's version reads:\n\n\"In the event of dispute between the company and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia which cannot be settled by consultation/deliberation, the Government of Indonesia is prepared/ready to follow settlement according to the provisions of the convention on the settlement of disputes between States and Foreign Citizen regarding investments in accordance with Law Number 5 Year 1968\".306\n\nBKPM Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 dated 23 November 2005 (**Exh. R-003**).\n\n235.\n\nIn its original wording, Section IX(4) reads as follows:\n\n\"Dalam hal terjadi perselisihan antara perusahaan dengan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia yang tidak dapat diselesaikan secara musyawarah, Pemerintah Indonesia bersedia mengikuti penyelesaian menurut ketentuan konvensi tentang penyelesaian perselisihan antara Negara dan Warga Negara Asing mengenai penanaman modal sesuai dengan Undang-undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1968\".\n\n236.\n\nThe 2006 BKPM Approval, sanctioning the acquisition of PT ICD by Churchill and Planet incorporates by reference the content of the 2005 Approval.307\n\nApproval of Changes in Participation Within the Company's Capital for PT ICD, Decision No. 579/III/PMA/2006 dated 8 May 2006 (**Exh. C-24**).\n\n237.\n\nIndonesia has essentially objected that (i) the BIT only contemplates the possibility to grant consent after the filing of a request of arbitration, (ii) that the BKPM lacks authority to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, (iii) that the word *bersedia* in Section IX(4) of the 2005 BKPM approval merely denotes a willingness to consider ICSID procedures, not consent, and (iv) that Section IX(4) only extends to PT ICD and not its shareholders.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal finds these objections ill-founded. First, as regards the timing of consent, Article 7(1) of the BIT contains no language precluding a host State from granting its consent to ICSID arbitration prior to the filing of a dispute by an investor. Second, the Tribunal finds that the words *bersedia mengikuti*, correctly translated as \"readiness/preparedness/willingness to follow\" the settlement provisions of the ICSID Convention are an expression of consent satisfying the ICSID requirement of consent in writing. Third, the Tribunal holds that Section IX(4) extends to PT ICD's shareholders because (i) PT ICD is a mere instrumentality of the Claimant, who had no choice but to structure its investment through a local vehicle,308 (ii) the dictionary on record does not translate the word *perusahaan* as company or corporation, but gives it the broader meaning of business or enterprise,309 (iii) the word *perseroan* is employed in the 2005 BKPM Approval when specifically targeting PT ICD as a corporation,310 while the word *perusahaan* is used in various contexts suggesting that it has a broader meaning, in particular in the 2006 BKPM Approval in the context of the obligation to sell shares of PT ICD to Indonesian nationals.311 Finally, the Tribunal is of the view that the BKPM has the power to grant consent to ICSID arbitration, since it is a government body reporting directly to the President and vested with authority to handle foreign investments.312 Had the President, who was copied on the 2005 BKPM Approval, deemed that the BKPM had overstepped its authority, then he would or should have intervened to rectify such mistake. Having failed to do so, Indonesia cannot now argue that the BKPM lacked authority to give consent to ICSID proceedings.\n\n*See* Article 3(1) of Law No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh.

C-361**).\n\n239.\n\nHaving held that Article 7(1) contains Indonesia's consent to arbitration, the Tribunal will now assess whether that consent extends to Churchill's investment in light of Indonesia's second preliminary objection relating to Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n**C. SECOND OBJECTION: THE CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENTS ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nIndonesia submits two related arguments with regard to the admission requirement. First, Indonesia contends that it legitimately withheld its consent because the BIT expressly limits its scope to investments having been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. Second, Indonesia submits that, even if *arguendo* the Tribunal were to find that Indonesia consented to ICSID arbitration as a general matter, the Tribunal would still lack jurisdiction because the Claimant's investments fall outside the scope of protected investments under the BIT.\n\n1.1 The investments fall outside the scope of Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT provides that the treaty shall only apply to those investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law.313 According to Indonesia, this \"admitted investments\" clause limits the scope of protected investments under the BIT, even if the Tribunal were to find that Indonesia gave its consent to ICSID arbitration.314 In this case, Indonesia contends that Churchill must be denied protection because it has not been granted admission pursuant to the 1967 law or any law amending or replacing it.\n\nUK-Indonesia BIT, *supra* note 84 (**Exh. R-001**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 218.\n\n1.2 The stringent threshold requirement of the \"admitted investments\" clause\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nFor the Respondent, the admission clause is very important for developing countries such as Indonesia, as it allows them to screen foreign investments and thereby safeguard their strategic natural resources.315 Its primary effect is to condition \"the extension of treaty protections on prior approval of specified investments\".316\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 218.\n\n243.\n\nRelying on *Mytilineos v. Serbia and Montenegro*, Indonesia argues that Article 2(1) sets a higher standard than more conventional legality clauses.317 Indonesia therefore invites the Tribunal to follow other arbitral tribunals and to dismiss Churchill's case *ab initio*.318\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 218, citing *Mytilineos Holdings SA v. The State Union of Servia & Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 8 September 2006 (\" *Mytilineos* \"), \u00b6\u00b6 137-144 (**Exh. RLA-071**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 220.\n\n1.3 The investments have not been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent highlighted the fact that the BKPM did not have the opportunity to review PT ICD's articles of association before granting its approval on 23 November 2005, although the Respondent acknowledged that PT ICD was granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Investment Law and that the BKPM approved the Churchill's and Planet's acquisition of PT ICD in 2006.319\n\nTr. 13052013, 24:25 ff., esp. 33:4-34:8; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 86-88; RMOJ, \u00b6 48 (\"On 23 November 2005, PT ICD received an approval from BKPM to be a *Penanaman Modal Asing* (PMA - foreign direct investment) company, operating as a *Perseroan Terbatas* (PT - limited liability company)\").\n\n245.\n\nIndonesia interprets the admission requirement not as a threshold whereby once admission has been granted the requirement is fulfilled, but as a continuous process whereby a foreign investor violates the admission requirement when engaging in activities that are not covered by the terms of the BKPM approval.320 In particular, the Respondent argues that (i) by entering into a series of agreements,321 especially by concluding the Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership,322 the Claimant violated Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law; and (ii) by engaging in mining activities and not confining itself to providing mining services, the Claimant violated the terms of its admission.323\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 69 (\"Investors must also remain in compliance with the terms of their admission as reflected in their approvals in order to remain admitted in Indonesia and to continue benefiting from protections afforded under the respective BITs\").\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 237.\n\nDeed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between (1) PT Ridlatama Steel, PT Ridlatama Power, PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral, PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo and PT Techno Coal Utama Prima and (2) PT Indonesia Coal Development dated 22 May 2007 (**Exh. P-17**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.\n\n246.\n\nIn connection with the first argument, the Respondent seeks to rebut the Claimant's submission that the Bupati of East Kutai authorized it to enter into legal relationships with the Ridlatama companies.324 According to the Respondent, the Bupati's authorization was given on condition of abiding with prevailing laws, which the Claimant did not do because it engaged in mining activities.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 241.\n\n247.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent expanded during the hearing on what it called \"indications of forgery\" in its previous submissions.325 It argued that there were many irregularities in certain important documents submitted by the Claimant, including the KP Exploration Licenses and the maps annexed thereto.326 Asked to elucidate the link between the forgery accusations and its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent answered as follows:\n\n\"[Tribunal:] Before that, what is the link between this issue and your jurisdictional objection?\n\n[Respondent:] This is basically to show that there is no interest whatsoever that the claimant has with respect to the substance matter, that is, the revocations of KP\".327\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 81-102.\n\nTr. 13052013, 212:14-233:19.\n\nTr. 13052013, 222:12-17.\n\n248.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's second argument related to mining activities, the Respondent states that Churchill announced on 5 April 2007 and 23 May 2007 that they made a promising coal discovery, 95% of which being situated in the PT RTM block.328 Stressing that PT RTM allegedly received a mining undertaking license for general survey on 24 May 2007 only, that is after the announcements, the Respondent contends that \"Churchill and/or PT RTM and/or PT RTP illegally undertook such mining survey activities as drilling in the areas for which they did not hold a license\".329\n\nChurchill website, *Discovery made at East Kutai coal project in Kalimantan*, Indonesia, dated 5 April 2007 (**Exh.

R-014**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 58.\n\n1.4 PT ICD's business field only covers mining support services\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIndonesia acknowledges that the Claimant's investments took the form of ownership of PT ICD, a local subsidiary, which received approval to operate as a foreign direct investment company under Indonesian law.330 However, PT ICD's business field was described in the 2005 BKPM Approval as \"General Mining Support Services\".331 Similarly, PT ICD's Articles of Association define the company's \"objective and purpose\" as \"business of geological and mining services\".332\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 222.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n250.\n\nIn support of this argument, the Respondent confronted Dr. Makarim in cross-examination with one of his articles published in the Jakarta Post.333 In this article, referring to PMA companies in general and not to PT ICD in particular, Dr. Makarim had expressed the following opinion:\n\n\"Also, the company's articles of association must have contained Objectives and Purposes clauses which would most likely limit its activities to mining services, not mining activities. Conducting activities that may be constructed as mining would be beyond its corporate authorization and therefore susceptible to nullification actions\".334\n\nNono Anwar Makarim, *The Risk of Convenient Alternatives*, The Jakarta Post, 1 August 2012 (**Exh.

Article 8(1) of this act provides that \"[f]oreign capital investment in the field of mining shall be based on a cooperation with the Government on the basis of a contract of work (\u2018 *kontrak karya* ') or other form in accordance with applicable laws and regulations\".338\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 8(1) (**Exh. RLA-006**).\n\n255.\n\nUnder Article 1(1) of the 2004 Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 1614,339 the contract of work just referred to is defined as \"an agreement between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia with Indonesian legal entity company in the framework of Foreign Investment to conduct extractive materials mining undertaking, excluding petroleum, natural gas, geothermal, radio active and coal\".\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 1614 Year 2004 concerning Guidelines for Processing Applications of Contracts of Work and Coal Cooperation Agreement in the framework of Foreign Investment (Excerpts), Art. 1(1) (**Exh.

Under Decree No. 1614 just referred to, the role of the BKPM is merely to forward the foreigner's investment application to the relevant ministries and the President, who must approve the coal cooperation agreement. Article 24 of such decree states that a draft PKP2B \"that has obtained recommendation from BKPM and has been consulted with the House of People's Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia is therefore submitted by the Minister for approval to the President\".341 Once approval has been obtained from the President, Article 25 of Decree No. 1614 directs that the PKP2B must be signed by the Minister \"on behalf of the Government\".342\n\n*Id.*, Art. 24.\n\n*Id*., Art. 25.\n\n258.\n\nIn sum, the BKPM Approvals did not allow PT ICD or Churchill to engage in mining activities *per se*. By doing so Churchill failed to observe the limits set forth in the BKPM Approvals.343\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 55-58, 63, 226.\n\n1.6 The Claimant circumvented the law by securing beneficial ownership in the Ridlatama licenses\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nIndonesia advances that only Indonesian nationals or companies can obtain KP licenses to engage in mining activities. PMAs such as PT ICD and foreign investors cannot obtain KP licenses.344\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 229.\n\n260.\n\nIndonesia further submits that Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law, promulgated on 26 April 2007345 and replacing the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law346 prohibits beneficial ownership by declaring that ownership and benefits associated with it are indivisible.347 Article 33(1) stipulates that \"domestic investor and foreign investor which undertake capital investment in the form of a limited liability company are prohibited from making any agreement and/or statement which confirms that ownership of share(s) in a limited liability company is for and on behalf of other party\". Article 33(2) then declares any such agreement null and void by operation of law.348 For the Respondent, various arrangements entered into by PT ICD on behalf of the Claimant violate Article 33 and are therefore null and void. Therefore, the Claimant should be denied protection under the BITs.\n\nLaw No. 25 on Investment, with Elucidation (2007) (**Exh. RLA-009**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 41.

Nono Anwar Makarim, *The Risk of Convenient Alternatives,* The Jakarta Post, 1 August 2012 (**Exh.

Specifically, it makes the following assertions:350\n\n- The 22 May 2007 Deed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between PT ICD and PT RS, PT RP, PT RTM, PT RTP and PT TCUP violates Article 33 as it provides for PT ICD's 75% beneficial ownership and control of these companies.351\n\n- The 25 May 2007 agreements (the cooperation agreement, the investors agreement, the pledge of shares agreements, and the powers of attorney) were concluded to allow the Claimant to engage in mining activities going beyond mere mining services and to obtain 75% of the mining revenue. Therefore they violated the 2007 Investment Law.352\n\n- The 28 November 2007 agreements (the second cooperation agreement, the second investor's agreement, the new pledge of shares agreements) also sought to secure PT ICD's benefits accruing from the KP licenses, thus violating the 2007 Investment Law.353\n\n- The 31 March 2008 agreements between PT ICD and PT IR and PT INP as well as with Mmes. Florita and Setiawan also breached the 2007 Investment Law.354\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 237.\n\nDeed of Beneficial Control and Ownership between (1) PT Ridlatama Steel, PT Ridlatama Power, PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral, PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo and PT Techno Coal Utama Prima and (2) PT Indonesia Coal Development dated 22 May 2007, Art. 4.1 (**Exh.

C-86**) ; Investors Agreement between PT ICD, Investmine Persada, Investama Resources, Ms. Florita and Ms. Ani Setiawan (**Exh. C-90**), both dated 31 March 2008.\n\n263.\n\nIndonesia believes that Churchill knew that it was prohibited to own shares in Indonesian companies holding KP licenses, as Article 5.7 of the 25 May 2007 Cooperation Agreement states that \"if there is any change in the law of the Republic of Indonesia which allows ICD to hold TCUP's shares in each of the KP Holders, TCUP and the KP Holders shall provide all necessary assistance. to ensure that such shares are transferred to ICD\".355\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 237, n. 334.\n\n264.\n\nFinally, Indonesia explains that it was not aware of these agreements because the Claimant operated under confidentiality agreements. However, when the Regent of East Kutai became aware in 2009 of the beneficial control exerted by the Claimant, most notably through Churchill's press releases in which it claimed to have become the owner of the EKCP coal reserves, he immediately requested clarification from Churchill and the London Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\").356 The Regent also informed the Claimant that it could not own any interests in Indonesian companies holding KP licenses, and that he had never issued a PKP2B or a KP license to them or to PT ICD or PT TCUP.357\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 238.\n\n*Id.*\n\n265.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant's interest in PT TCUP cannot find protection under the BIT, so the Respondent submits, because it was obtained after the revocation decrees of 4 May 2010. According to the Respondent, PT TCUP amended its articles of association on 16 April 2010 to authorize a capital increase and issue new shares. That amendment was approved by the Minister of Law and Human Rights on 15 June 2010, and only thereafter did PT ICD obtain a 99.01% direct interest in PT TCUP and Churchill the remaining 0.99%.\n\n266.\n\nThus, the Claimant is barred from invoking any rights in respect to its interest in PT TCUP as it acquired the shares in PT TCUP when the mining licenses were already revoked.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n2.1 The Claimant's investments have been admitted in accordance with the BIT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nFor the Claimant, Indonesia fails to explain the content of the admission requirement under the BIT and conflates that requirement with the larger legality requirement.358\n\nReply, \u00b6 166. *See also* : Tr. 13052013, 9:7-13.\n\n2.2 The meaning of the \"admission\" requirement\n----------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in ordinary usage and in light of the context in the UK-Indonesia BIT, the term \"admitted\" means \"allowed\" or \"approved for entry\".359 Therefore, the admission requirement is applicable at the time when making the investment and, once approved, the investment is covered by the BIT.360\n\nReply, \u00b6 167. *See also* : Tr. 14052013, 76:22-24.\n\nReply, \u00b6 168.\n\n269.\n\nTo support its interpretation of the term \"admitted\", the Claimant relies on similarly worded provisions in the Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN FTA361 and the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement.362 The Claimant also relies on *Desert Line Projects v. Yemen*, where the tribunal found that, in the absence of a specifically defined manner of certifying acceptance, a general endorsement of the investment at the highest level of the State satisfies the admission requirement.363 Finally, the Claimant disputes Indonesia's reliance on *Gruslin v. Malaysia* and *Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Myanmar*, because the facts underlying the present dispute are different.364\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171.\n\nReply, \u00b6 172.\n\nReply, \u00b6 174. *Desert Line, supra* note 116, \u00b6\u00b6 92, 98 (**Exh. RLA-061**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 177-178.\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's expansive reading of the admission requirement, which it seemingly convolutes with the \"in accordance with the law\" requirement: \"[I]t is our submission that once this admission is granted, the investment activity can commence within Indonesia without the need for further admissions. Indeed the whole point of admission is a singular act. If separate admissions were required for all investments subsequently, this would amount to a compliance with law requirement, which has been explicitly distinguished by authorities and also, of course, by a plain meaning of the term\".365\n\nTr. 14052013, 85:1-10. *See also* : Tr. 14052013, 82:6-11.\n\n271.\n\nTherefore, relying on *Hamester v. Ghana*, the Claimant insisted on the distinction between \"legality at the time of the initiation of the investment\" and \"legality during the performance of the investment\",366 the first aspect relating to jurisdiction and the second one to the merits.\n\nTr. 14052013, 80:21-23.\n\n2.3 All investments were granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law and the 2007 Investment Law\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, all of its investments have been established in accordance with the relevant foreign investment laws and granted admission by the competent authorities. PT ICD was granted a BKPM Approval in 2005 and received a Permanent Business License in 2007. After PT ICD's acquisition by Churchill and Planet in 2006, BKPM again granted its approval. All further investment activities also received authorization by the relevant authorities.\n\n273.\n\nIn support, the Claimant recalls that under both the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law367 and the 2007 Investment Law which replaced it,368 the BKPM is the agency with authority to grant admission to foreign investors in Indonesia.369\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh.

In that regard, Dr. Makarim points out that \"once the BKPM issued its 2006 Approval and the MEMR issued a Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License, PT ICD was admitted into Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law\".370 Dr. Makarim further states that none of PT ICD's subsequent investment activity required additional approvals to fulfill the admission requirement under the BIT.371\n\nReply, \u00b6 182; Makarim ER2, p. 12.\n\nReply, \u00b6 182; Makarim ER2, p. 7.\n\n275.\n\nIn any event, according to the Claimant, it received all the necessary authorizations and approvals, in particular:\n\n- The 2006 BKPM Approval;\n\n- The 2006 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources;\n\n- The 2007 BKPM Permanent Business License; and\n\n- The 2011 Mineral, Coal and Geothermal Mining Business License from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.372\n\nReply, \u00b6 183.\n\n276.\n\nIn each of these approvals or licenses, PT ICD's foreign shareholding is explicitly mentioned, a clear recognition by Indonesia that these approvals concerned an investment by foreigners.373\n\nReply, \u00b6 184.\n\n277.\n\nIn addition to disputing that it engaged in mining activities *per se* in violation of the relevant mining licenses, the Claimant argues that Indonesia's allegation that it circumvented the law by restructuring the investment - besides being wrong - has no bearing on the fulfillment of the admission requirement.\n\n278.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant disputes that PT ICD could only engage in mining activities in the coal sector by concluding a PKP2B with the Government;374 that PT ICD's mining license only covered mining services in a limited sense;375 that Churchill engaged in mining activity without permission;376 and that the contractual arrangements with the Ridlatama companies violated Article 33 of the 2007 Investment Law.377\n\nReply, \u00b6 188.\n\nReply, \u00b6 190.\n\nReply, \u00b6 189.\n\nReply, \u00b6 191.\n\n2.4 The Claimant's investments have otherwise been made in accordance with Indonesian law\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.4.1 The UK-Indonesia BIT contains no legality requirement\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant stresses that Indonesia does not contest that the UK-Indonesia BIT contains no express legality requirement.378 In the absence of such requirement, the Claimant puts forward that Indonesia \"cannot claim plausibly that any illegality in the Claimant['s] investment, other than lack of proper admission, would deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction\".379 The Claimant also notes that Indonesia has failed to substantiate its position with a single authority, except for references where the definition of investment included a legality requirement.380\n\nReply, \u00b6 197, referring also to RMOJ, \u00b6 248.\n\nReply, \u00b6 198.\n\nReply, \u00b6 198.\n\n2.4.2 Churchill never performed mining *per se*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimant challenges Indonesia's allegations that it engaged in mining operations without the necessary authorizations. There is no evidence showing what activities qualify as mining services as opposed to actual mining: \"Where in the process from prospecting for coal [\u2026] to the extraction and sale of coal, can it be said that mining services starts or stops; or which activities within the process from start to finish are services as opposed to actual mining?\"381\n\nTr. 14052013, 119:21-120:2.\n\n281.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant denies having performed mining per se, save for drilling in conformity with the KP Exploration Licenses granted to the Ridlatama companies.382 At the hearing, it recalled that the licenses were revoked when only 20 percent of the territory [covered by them] had been fully explored. No mine was ever opened. No mine was ever operational. No coal was ever mined from the East Kutai Coal Project\".383\n\nReply, \u00b6 189.\n\nTr. 14052013, 120:9-16.\n\n2.4.3 The Respondent's accusations of document forgery are not supported by evidence\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant strongly rejects the Respondent's accusations raised during the hearing regarding allegedly forged documents in the record. It explains that some document irregularities may be due to clerical errors made by officials in the Regency of East Kutai. Notwithstanding, the fact that the Respondent has not acted on these accusations much earlier is sufficient to rebut them.384\n\nTr. 14052013, 104:18-105:4.\n\n2.4.4 The Respondent's objection could only have a bearing on the merits, not on jurisdiction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nFinally, the Claimant contends that Indonesia's reliance on *World Duty Free v. Kenya* and *Plama v. Bulgaria* is misleading to the extent that its introduction of the legality requirement at the jurisdictional stage conflates jurisdiction with admissibility, which is a merits issue.385 The Tribunal should not refuse to afford Churchill a forum to adjudicate its claims. In any event, Indonesia has not reserved admissibility as a preliminary question, which could therefore only affect the merits if at all.\n\nTr. 14052013, 77:20-25.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n284.\n\nHaving determined that Indonesia has given its advance consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 7(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, the Tribunal must now determine the scope of Indonesia's consent in light of Indonesia's second jurisdictional objection. It must in particular determine whether Churchill's investment is covered by the Treaty.\n\n285.\n\nIn light of the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal will first analyze Article 2(1) of the Treaty so as to determine the meaning of the words \"granted admission\" (3.1.). Thereafter, it will turn to the Indonesian Foreign Capital Investment Law referred to in Article 2(1) of the BIT (3.2.) and to the BKPM Approvals (3.3.).\n\n3.1 The admission requirement under Article 2(1) of the BIT\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"This Agreement shall only apply to investments by nationals or companies of the United Kingdom in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia which have been granted admission in accordance with the Foreign Capital Investment Law No. 1 of 1967 or any law amending or replacing it\".386\n\nUK-Indonesia BIT, *supra* note 84 (**Exh. CLA-18** ; **Exh. R-001**).\n\n287.\n\nIt is common ground that Article 2(1) limits the application of the BIT to investments that have been granted admission in accordance with the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law (or any successive statute). By contrast, the Parties are in disagreement on the temporal scope of application of Article 2(1), i.e. whether the requirement implies admission once upon entry into the country, as argued by the Claimant, or whether it extends through the entire duration of the investment operation, as advocated by the Respondent.\n\n288.\n\nIn accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal will start by ascertaining the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 2(1). This provision requires an investment to \"have been granted admission\" by Indonesia under the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the verb \"to admit\" means \"to allow\" or \"to accept\".387 That same dictionary defines the noun \"admission\" as \"the process or fact of entering or being allowed to enter a place or organization\".388\n\nOxford Dictionary of English (2010), at 22 (**Exh. CLA-113**).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n289.\n\nThe content of this definition and the observation that the admission must \"have been granted\" by the host State, leads the Tribunal to understand that the admission requirement set forth in Article 2(1) is a one-time occurrence, a gateway through all British investors must pass once.\n\n290.\n\nThe context confirms this understanding. Article 2 is entitled \"Scope of the Agreement\", implying that investments that do not meet the requirements under Article 2 will not find protection under the UK-Indonesia Treaty, even if the underlying operation qualifies as an investment under Article 1(1). The admission requirement is consequently of jurisdictional nature. As such, it necessarily applies at the time of entry into the country and not during the entire operation of the project. This conclusion is further confirmed by previous arbitral decisions.389\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, \u00b6 345 (**Exh. ClA-131**) ; *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH &* *Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6 127 (**Exh. RLA-058**).\n\n291.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal addresses certain additional arguments and cases which the Parties invoked. In this context, it agrees with the Claimant that the admission requirement embodied in Article 2(1) is narrower than a traditional legality requirement in the sense that it only demands admission in accordance with the relevant domestic laws and not general compliance with the host State's legislation.\n\n292.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's position, the Tribunal does not find that *Mytilineos*, *Gruslin*, and *Yaung Chi Oo* support the Respondent's argument. In *Mytilineos*, the tribunal was called upon to interpret a general \"in accordance with the legislation\" provision contained in the Greece-Yugoslavia BIT and the tribunal expressly mentioned that the treaty did not require any registration of investments.390\n\n*Mytilineos, supra* note 317, \u00b6\u00b6 140, 146 (**Exh. RLA-071**).\n\n293.\n\nThe *Gruslin* decision is also inapposite here. It is true that the Belgium-Malaysia Intergovernmental Agreement under scrutiny there required that the assets be invested in Malaysia in an \"approved project\" classified as such by the relevant Ministry.391 The sole arbitrator found that this requirement was not satisfied through a general approval of the business activity, but that the specific \"project\" needed approval.392 In the view of the Tribunal, *Gruslin* must be distinguished, since the thrust of Indonesia's argument is that Churchill violated Indonesian laws after the approval of its investment, not in the making of the investment.\n\n*Philippe Gruslin v. Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/3, Award, 28 November 2000 *(\"\u2018Gruslin\"),* \u00b6 9.2 (**Exh. RLA-062**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 25.5.\n\n294.\n\nFinally, in *Yaung Chi Oo*, the tribunal refused jurisdiction on the ground that the investment had not obtained an additional approval in line with the requirements of the 1987 ASEAN Agreement.393 It held that all investors, including those who were already admitted in Myanmar prior to the entry into force of the ASEAN Agreement, had to apply for approval in conformity with Article II(3) of that treaty to benefit from treaty protection.394 The investor failed to do so and, hence, jurisdiction was denied.395\n\n*Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v. Government of the Union of Myanmar*, ASEAN Case No. ARB/01/1, Award, 31 March 2003 *(\"Yaung Chi Oo* \"), \u00b6 58 (**Exh. RLA-062**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 62.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 63.\n\n295.\n\nIn sum, none of these cases support Indonesia's argument that the admission requirement extends throughout the duration of the investor's activity. In other words, the admission requirement under Article 2(1) of the treaty is restricted to the time of the initiation of the investment. The Tribunal must thus analyze the content of the admission requirement under the relevant legislation.\n\n3.2 The Indonesian Foreign Investment Law\n-----------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nForeign investment in Indonesia is governed by the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.396 This law was amended in 1970 in respect of matters of no relevance here,397 and then replaced on 26 April 2007 by the Investment Law No. 25 (\"2007 Investment Law\").398 As to the 2007 Investment Law, the Respondent acknowledges that it does not diverge significantly from its predecessor, save for the addition of Article 33.399\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2** ; **Exh. RLA-006**). *See* RMOJ, \u00b6 41. The Parties submitted different English versions of the 1967 Foreign Capital Investment Law. However, neither Party indicated that there is any material difference between the two translations.\n\n**Exh. CLA-3**.\n\nLaw No. 25 on Investment (2007) (**Exh. CLA-4** ; **Exh. RLA-009**).\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 47.\n\n297.\n\nIt is common ground that Churchill acquired its interests in PT ICD on 24 April 2006 and that it obtained the BKPM Approval for this acquisition on 8 May 2006,400 i.e. before the entry into force of the 2007 Investment Law. The Tribunal will thus assess the present objection by application of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 223.\n\n298.\n\nArticle 1 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law provides that it applies to \"direct foreign capital investment\" made in Indonesia.401 Article 2 defines foreign capital investment as including (a) foreign exchange, (b) equipment, and (c) transferable profits used to finance an enterprise in Indonesia.402 Article 3 defines an enterprise as understood in Article 2 as a legal entity organized under Indonesian law and domiciled in Indonesia. Under Articles 4 and 5 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, the Indonesian Government is empowered to determine the operating area for foreign capital and the fields of activity which are open to foreign investment.\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967), Art. 1 (**Exh. CLA-2** ; **Exh. RLA-006**).\n\n*Id*., Art. 2(a)-(c).\n\n299.\n\nRegarding the field of mining activities, Article 8(1) of the law requires cooperation with the Government by way of a work contract or otherwise:\n\n\"Foreign investment in the field of mining shall be carried out in cooperation with the Government on the basis of a work contract (\" *kontrak karya* \") or other form in accordance with revailing [sic] regulations\".403\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2**), Art. 8(1). *See also:* **Exh. RLA-006**, Art. 8(1).\n\n300.\n\nFinally, about the implementation of the law, Article 28(1) provides for coordination in the following terms:\n\n\"Provisions of this Law shall be implemented by coordination among the Government agencies concerned in order to ensure harmonization of Government policies regarding foreign capital\".404\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2**), Art. 28(1).\n\n301.\n\nArticle 28(2) specifies that further provisions will be adopted in respect of procedures for the coordination contemplated in paragraph 1. The elucidation to Article 28, which is appended to the law, contemplates the creation of a coordination body. It states that the \"execution of the Law involves the domains of several Department [sic]. For that reason it is necessary to have a simple coordination body which may take the form of a council consisting of the Ministers concerned\".405\n\nLaw No. 1 on Foreign Investment (1967) (**Exh. CLA-2**), Elucidation Article by Article, Art. 28.\n\n302.\n\nThis being so, the 1967 Foreign Investment Law does not specify the procedures for a foreign investor to obtain the governmental approval contemplated in Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, nor does it designate an authority in charge of implementing the law. The Parties agree that the BKPM, the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board, is the responsible authority to grant the investment approvals contemplated in Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT.406\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 42; Reply, \u00b6 181.\n\n303.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Respondent, the BKPM was only created in 1973.407 It further notes that, under the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33 regarding the Capital Investment Coordinating Board, the BKPM has the duty to assist Indonesia's President in formulating investment policies, completing investment approvals and evaluating their implementation, and issuing business licenses.408\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00b6 2. It appears that the BKPM was created under the 1973 Presidential Decree No. 20. This Decree was not put into evidence by either Party.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 33 of 1981 Regarding the Capital Investment Coordinating Board, Articles 2 and 3(I) (**Exh. RLA-099** ; **Exh. CLA-366**).\n\n304.\n\nIn 2004, a so-called \"One-Roof Service System\" was established by Presidential Decree No. 29.409 According to that decree, the BKPM had delegated authority from the relevant Ministries to issue capital investment approvals under the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Article 3 of the decree provides that:\n\n\"Services of capital investment approvals, permits and facilities as referred to in Article 2 letter c within the framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment are carried out by BKPM, based on delegation of authority by the Minister/Head of Non Departmental Government Institution which fosters the relevant lines of business of capital investment through the one-roof service system\".410\n\nPresidential Decree No. 29 of 2004 Regarding the Implementation of Capital Investment within the Framework of Foreign Capital Investment and Domestic Capital Investment through the One-Roof Service System (**Exh. C-361** ; **Exh. RLA-106**). Article 1(5) of the Decree defines the One-Roof Service System as \"a system of the services of granting capital investment approvals and implementation permits carried out by one Government institution charged with responsibilities in the field of capital investment\".\n\n*Id.*, Art. 3.\n\n305.\n\nArticle 4 Decree No. 29 further provides that decentralized governmental bodies may also delegate the authority to grant investment approvals to the BKPM:\n\n\"Governor/Regent/Mayor in line with his/her authority may delegate authority in investment approval, licenses and facilities services as meant in Article 2 letter c to BKPM (Investment Coordinating Board) through the one-stop service system\".411\n\n*Id.*, Art. 4.\n\n306.\n\nIn the field of mining, the Ministry of Mining had delegated its authority to the BKPM in 1978 already.412 As a result of this delegation and of the powers vested in the BKPM under the Decrees of 1981 and 2004, when Churchill applied for its investment approval, the BKPM was the authority competent to grant that approval.\n\nDecree of Minister of Mining No. 211/Kpts/Pertamb/1978 Year 1978 concerning Delegation of Authority to the Chairman of Investment Coordinating Board to Grant [License to] Undertake Utilization of Extractive Materials and Provide Consultation on the Granting of Investment Facilities in the Field of Non-Oil and Natural Gas Mining and to Grant License to Undertake Mining Supporting Services, Art. 1 (**Exh. RLA-098**).\n\n307.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal must now determine whether Churchill obtained the investment approval from the BKPM in conformity with Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT, thus enabling it to benefit from protection under the treaty.\n\n3.3 The BKPM Approvals\n----------------------\n\n308.\n\nIt is undisputed that, pursuant to Article 3 of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, Churchill could only invest in Indonesia through a local vehicle incorporated and domiciled in Indonesia.413 It is equally undisputed that foreign investors seeking to invest in the mining sector can only do so through a foreign direct investment company, a so-called *Penanaman Modal Asing* (\"PMA\").\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 42; Reply, \u00b6 11.\n\n309.\n\nChurchill invested in Indonesia by acquiring a 95% share in an Indonesian PMA called PT Indonesian Coal Development or PT ICD. PT ICD was initially created by Profit Point Group Ltd, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi, an Indonesian national.414 Profit Point Group Ltd owned 95% of the shares and Mr. Andreas Rinaldi the remaining 5%.\n\nRMOJ, \u00b6 48.\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that PT ICD \"received an approval from BKPM to be a *Penanaman Modal Asing* (PMA - foreign direct investment) company, operating as a *Perseroan Terbatas* (PT - limited liability company)\".415 The BKPM approved the incorporation of PT ICD on 23 November 2005 (the \"2005 BKPM Approval\").416 The preamble of the 2005 BKPM Approval refers to (1) the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, (2) the 1967 Mining Law, (3) the 1981 Presidential Decree No. 33 on the BKPM, (4) the 2004 Presidential Decree No. 29 on the One-Roof Service System, and (5) the 1978 Decree on the delegation of powers from the Ministry of Mining to the BKPM.417\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nBKPM Foreign Investment Approval Letter No. 1304/I/PMA/2005 (**Exh.

Besides requiring that, within fifteen years from the start of commercial operations, PT ICD must sell part of its shares to Indonesian citizens, and that any subsequent change in the share capital must be approved by the BKPM, the 2006 BKPM Approval incorporates by reference the content of the 2005 BKPM Approval.\n\nShareholders Resolution Deed No. 17 dated 24 April 2006 (**Exh.

C-24**).\n\n313.\n\nOn this basis, and in particular in view of the fact that PT ICD received the necessary approval by the BKPM in 2005 and that the change in PT ICD's shareholding was subsequently approved by the BKPM in 2006, the Tribunal concludes that Churchill obtained the necessary approval when making its investment in May 2006, thus fulfilling the requirement set in Article 2(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT.\n\n314.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal denies Indonesia's second preliminary objection and concludes that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute.\n\n315.\n\nThe present decision is limited to jurisdiction and does not prejudge any alleged wrongdoing by the Claimant during the operation of the investment, which is a matter for the merits.\n\n**VI.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy letter dated 7 March 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and, if possible, agree on a schedule for the merits phase. On 24 March 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had not been able to agree on a schedule. In addition, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they disagree with the Respondent's proposal to bifurcate the merits phase into liability and quantum.\n\n**II. Position of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\na. Position of the Respondent\n-----------------------------\n\n2.\n\nIn its letter of 24 March 2014, the Respondent argues that the bifurcation in a liability phase and a quantum phase is appropriate in the present circumstances. In essence, were the Tribunal to find in favor of the Respondent on liability, the Respondent would not have to spend the time and resources \"necessary to examine the complex technical, economic and financial aspects of the claims or to decide on the proper application of legal principles to the question of quantum\".1\n\nRespondent's letter to the Tribunal dated 24 March 2014, p. 1.\n\n3.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants confirmed the complexities surrounding quantum (i) in their Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits (the \"Memorial\") and (ii) in their unsolicited supplemental memorial on quantum and damages dated 9 May 2013 (the \"Supplemental Memorial\"). First, for reasons related to the \"technical complexity of valuing an asset, the EKCP\",2 the Claimants sought leave in their Memorial \"to present fully the quantification of their loss by a date to be fixed by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties\".3 Second, in a letter of 9 May 2013 accompanying the Supplemental Memorial, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that supporting documentation of two expert reports had yet to be filed.4 Third, the Claimants indicated in their Supplemental Memorial that as the proceedings advance they may file new valuations based on a different valuation date,5 including possibly a new DCF analysis.6\n\n*Id.*, p. 2; referring to Mem., \u00b6 398.\n\n*Id.*, p. 2; referring to Mem., \u00b6 397.\n\n*Id.*, p. 2; referring to the Claimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 9 May 2013.\n\n*Id.*, p. 2; referring to Supp. Mem., \u00b6 29.\n\n*Id.*, p. 2; referring to Supp. Mem., \u00b6 14.\n\n4.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent submits that it should not be required to expend significant resources and time on issues of quantum as long as there is no finding of liability. It estimates that a 10-day hearing will be necessary on liability and, if applicable, a 3-4 day-hearing on quantum.\n\n5.\n\nAs regards the schedule for the liability phase, the Respondent notes that it will need more than 5 months for its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and 4 months for its Rejoinder. In addition, the Respondent requests a document production phase prior to its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n6.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent proposes the following schedule:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dates** | **Submission** |\n| 14 April 2014 | Requests to produce documents |\n| 5 May 2014 | Production of documents and objections to Requests to produce, if any |\n| 19 May 2014 | Responses to objections to Requests to produce, if any |\n| 2 June 2014 | Request to Tribunal for rulings on objections to Requests to produce |\n| 16 June 2014 | Tribunal's ruling on Requests to produce |\n| 30 June 2014 | Production pursuant to Tribunal's ruling on Requests to produce |\n| 3 November 2014 | Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Liability |\n| 3 February 2015 | Claimants' Reply |\n| 4 May 2015 | Respondent's Rejoinder |\n| May/June 2015 | Pre-hearing Conference |\n| August/September 2015 in Singapore | Hearing on Liability (approximately 10 days) |\n\nb. Position of the Claimants\n----------------------------\n\n7.\n\nIn their letter of 24 March 2014, the Claimants stress that they are keen to proceed to the merits without delay.7 They oppose the Respondent's proposed bifurcation and schedule.8\n\nClaimants' letter to the Tribunal dated 24 March 2014, p. 1\n\n*Id.*\n\n8.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's proposal of bifurcation is unjustified and designed to introduce delay. Regarding the Respondent's proposed schedule, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has been in possession of the Claimants' Memorial since 13 March 2013, and that it would be reasonable to expect the Respondent to produce its Counter-Memorial promptly. Accordingly, the Claimants propose to grant the Respondent 3 months from the Tribunal's Decisions on Jurisdiction dated 24 February 2014, which would give the Respondent a total of 14 months to prepare its Counter-Memorial from the filing of the Claimants' Memorial.9\n\n*Id.*, p. 2.\n\n9.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants propose to hold a document production phase 3 weeks after the filing of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, giving the Parties 3 weeks to respond to the respective request, and then 2 weeks to the Tribunal to make a decision on any outstanding objections. Thereafter, the Claimants would have 2 months to file their Reply and the Respondent 2 months to file its Rejoinder. The hearing on the merits should be held at the earliest possible opportunity, possibly 6 weeks after the filing of the Rejoinder. The hearing should last between 7 and 10 days.\n\n10.\n\nConsequently, the Claimant proposed the following schedule:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dates** | **Submission** |\n| 27 May 2014 | Respondent's Counter-Memorial |\n| 17 June 2014 | The Parties exchange Requests for the Production of Documents |\n| 8 July 2014 | The Parties respond to each other's Requests for the Production of Documents |\n| 15 July 2014 | The Parties produce documents in respect of Requests to which there is no objection |\n| 22 July 2014 | The Tribunal issues ruling on disputed Production Requests |\n| 5 August 2014 | The Parties produce documents pursuant to Tribunal's ruling |\n| 6 October 2014 | Claimants' Reply |\n| 5 December 2014 | Respondent's Rejoinder |\n| January-February 2015 | Hearing on the Merits |\n\n**III. Discussion**\n-------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe present order addresses (a) the bifurcation request and (b) the calendar.\n\na. Bifurcation\n--------------\n\n12.\n\nIt is common ground, and rightly so, that the decision to bifurcate ICSID proceedings falls within the procedural powers of the Tribunal. While Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention is not applicable in the present instance, Article 44 of the ICSID Convention endows the Tribunal with the discretionary power to decide any question of procedure not covered by the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules, or an agreement of the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nWhile the Claimants oppose bifurcation on the grounds that it is \"unjustified and plainly designed to introduce delay\", the Respondent argues that bifurcation is appropriate in the present circumstances since (i) it would be unduly burdensome to require the Respondent to address quantum-related issues when liability is not established, and (ii) it would be premature to examine quantum in light of the Claimants' incomplete submissions and their acknowledgement of the complexities involved in presenting their damages.\n\n14.\n\nWhile it understands the Respondent's concerns, the Tribunal does not believe they are justified and is disinclined to bifurcate liability and quantum for the following reasons. First, if bifurcation of liability and quantum were accepted and liability established at the end of the liability phase, there would be a need for a further phase dealing with quantum, with the result that the totality of the two merits phases would be significantly longer and more expensive than non-bifurcated merits proceedings. By contrast, if liability is not established in non-bifurcated proceedings, any additional costs which the Respondent may have incurred as a result of the absence of bifurcation may be taken into account when the Tribunal makes its decision on costs. In addition, the quantum part, even if complex, appears to require significantly fewer resources than the part on liability (among other elements, this can be shown by reference to the number of hearing days requested by the Respondent).\n\n15.\n\nThese efficiency concerns are particularly relevant where, as here, there has already been a separate phase on jurisdiction, meaning that the bifurcation would in reality be trifurcation prolonging already relatively long proceedings even more.\n\n16.\n\nSecond, the Claimants' damage case as it arises from the Supplemental Memorial on Quantum, filed on the eve of the hearing on jurisdiction, is already extensively pleaded and accompanied by two expert reports. It is true that the Claimants have reserved the possibility of filing a DCF valuation based on another production quantity (paragraphs 14 and 139 of the Supplemental Memorial) and noted in their letter of 9 May 2013 that documentation in support of the damage expert reports would still need to be filed. In order to ascertain that the Respondent can fully defend itself in respect of damages in its two memorials, the Tribunal is minded to give the Claimants time to supplement their memorial in respect of these two damage-related items before the Respondent's Counter-Memorial. This appears unobjectionable in light of the very short time within which the Claimants filed their Memorial and will give even more time to the Respondent to prepare its defense on liability, on which it can start without having to wait for the Claimants' supplementation on damages.\n\n17.\n\nThird and finally, the Tribunal is of the view that the solution thus reached is in line with the Parties' expectations towards time-efficient and cost-effective proceedings, on the one hand, and their due process rights, on the other, including in particular the right of defense of the Respondent.\n\nb. Calendar\n-----------\n\n18.\n\nHaving regard to the Parties' views and in light of the considerations set forth above, the Tribunal considers that the following calendar will combine the Parties' opportunity to be heard and efficiency (see also Annex 1). In this context, the Tribunal has taken note of the positions of the Parties regarding the appropriate juncture at which the Parties would request document production. In line with common practice in international arbitration, the Tribunal is of the view that the document production phase should take place after the first round of written submissions. This timing will allow each Party to have knowledge of the allegations and documents submitted by the other before seeking specific documents from its opponent. It will also allow the Tribunal to better assess the relevance of documents when ruling on requests for production. Accordingly, the Tribunal sets the calendar as follows:\n\n18.1. The Claimants shall file documentation in support of their damage expert reports and any valuation as reserved in their Supplemental Memorial by **23 May 2014** ;\n\n18.2. The Respondent shall file its Counter-Memorial on Merits by **10 October 2014** ;\n\n18.3. The Parties shall exchange requests for production of documents simultaneously, if any, by **27 October 2014**. Such requests shall be recorded in the form of a schedule following the format indicated in \u00b6 15.6 of Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\"). Such requests shall not be sent to the Tribunal or the ICSID Secretariat;\n\n18.4. Each Party shall produce the requested documents that are in its possession, custody or control and to which it does not object, or submit its objections to a request of the other Party, if any, by **14 November 2014**. Such objections shall be recorded in the form of a joint schedule following the format indicated in \u00b6 15.6 of PO1;\n\n18.5. Each Party shall respond to these objections, if any, by **24 November 2014**. Each Party shall provide the other Party and the Tribunal with the completed schedule following the format indicated in \u00b6 15.6 of PO1;\n\n18.6. The Tribunal will then rule on the objections by **8 December 2014** ;\n\n18.7. Each Party shall produce the documents ordered to be produced by **19 December 2014** ;\n\n18.8. The Claimants shall file their Reply on Merits by **20 February 2015** ;\n\n18.9. The Respondent shall file its Rejoinder on Merits by **4 May 2015** ;\n\n18.10. The Parties shall identify the witnesses and experts whom they intend to cross-examine at the hearing by **22 May 2015** ;\n\n18.11. The Tribunal (or the President by way of delegation) and the Parties will hold a pre-hearing telephone conference on **1 June 2015 at 14:00 CET**.\n\n18.12. The Hearing on the Merits will be held in Singapore on dates which the Tribunal will propose to the Parties shortly."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9 (Provisional measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2014-07-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9 (Provisional measures)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present order deals with an Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Application\") filed by Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd (the \"Claimants\") on 27 March 2014, by which the Claimants requested that the Tribunal:\n\na. Recommend that the Republic of Indonesia (\"Indonesia\" or the \"Respondent\"), its agencies and instrumentalities:\n\ni. Refrain from threatening or commencing any criminal investigation or prosecution against the Claimants, their witnesses in these proceedings, and any person associated with the Claimants\u2019 operations in Indonesia, including their wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indonesia Coal Development (PT ICD), pending the outcome of this arbitration;\n\nii. Stay or suspend any current criminal investigation or prosecution against the Claimants\u2019 current and former employees, affiliates or business partners pending the outcome of this arbitration;\n\niii. Refrain from engaging in any other conduct that would:\n\ni. Threaten the exclusivity of this ICSID arbitration;\n\nii. Aggravate the dispute between the Parties;\n\niii. Alter the *status quo;* or\n\niv. Jeopardize the procedural integrity of these proceedings; and\n\nb.

Upon a request for an extension of such time by the Respondent and after having heard the position of the Claimants, the Tribunal agreed on 11 April 2014 to extend the time limit for the Respondent\u2019s response until 25 April 2014. The Respondent subsequently filed its response within this time limit.\n\n3.\n\nIn its Response to the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Response\"), Indonesia objected to the Application and requested the Tribunal to:\n\na. Reject the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures, as it fails to satisfy the elements to be applied in determining whether to grant provisional measures; and\n\nb. Award to the Respondent the costs associated with its opposition to the Claimants\u2019 Application, including Indonesia\u2019s legal and administrative fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.2\n\nThe Republic of Indonesia's Response to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 25 April 2014, \u00b6 76; Respondent's Rejoinder to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 27 May 2014, \u00b6 64.\n\n4.\n\nOn 28 April 2014, having reviewed the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit a reply by 12 May 2014 and the Respondent a rejoinder by 26 May 2014, which the Parties did.\n\n**II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of the Claimants**\n--------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the announcement made by the Regent of East Kutai just days after the Tribunal\u2019s Decisions on Jurisdiction of his intention to initiate criminal proceedings \"against the Claimants and their witnesses\",3 and the Regent\u2019s reported filing on 21 March 2014 of criminal charges against the Ridlatama group on the ground of forgery of official documents \"are not a good faith exercise of sovereign powers, but rather a calculated act designed to obstruct or derail these ICSID proceedings\".4 According to the Claimants, the timing of the investigation \"leaves no doubt that it is a tactical response to this Tribunal's decision to scrutinize the merits of the Claimants' claims\".5\n\nApplication, \u00b6 16.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 20; Reply, \u00b6 18.\n\nReply, \u00b6 18.\n\n6.\n\nIn the Application, the Claimants allege that Indonesia has \"reacted impetuously\" to the Tribunal's Decisions on Jurisdiction by engaging in \"strong-arm tactics\" targeted at intimidating or otherwise destabilizing the Claimants' witnesses and potential witnesses, thus \"seeking to usurp the jurisdiction of this Tribunal\".6 Specifically, the Claimants call on the Tribunal to recommend that Indonesia refrain from threatening or commencing any criminal investigation or prosecution against the Claimants, their witnesses in these proceedings, or any other person associated with the Claimants' operations in Indonesia.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 1.\n\n7.\n\nFor the Claimants, at the hearing on jurisdiction lead counsel for Indonesia made explicit threats of criminal investigation and prosecution against the Claimants' witnesses and potential witnesses, including the Claimants' current and past employees still residing in Indonesia.7 He also made \"a clear and direct threat\" to one of the Claimants' key witnesses, Mr. Paul Benjamin. He did not refer to him as a mere \"cooperating witness\" as now alleged by Indonesia, but insisted that Mr. Benjamin would be accused of a serious crime as \"the one who arrange[d] control of all the quote unquote production of that document\".8 Upon a close review of the transcript of the hearing, it becomes clear that \"Mr. Dermawan intended to intimidate, harass, and put undue pressure and influence on the Claimants and their witnesses\".9\n\nReply, \u00b6 8.\n\nReply, \u00b6 10, citing Mr. Dermawan's comments at the hearing, at Tr. 14052013, 153:16-18.\n\nReply, \u00b6 11.\n\n8.\n\nRelying on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal is empowered to recommend the provisional measures it seeks, in particular the preservation and protection of the rights which they assert in these proceedings, and which run the risk of being destroyed or seriously prejudiced by the actions of the Respondent.10\n\nApplication, \u00b6 25.\n\n9.\n\nIn reliance on arbitral decisions, the Claimants submit that the requirements for provisional measures are (i) that the Claimants have rights requiring protection by this Tribunal, (ii) that the requested measures are urgent, and (iii) necessary. They add that some tribunals have in addition applied a *prima facie* test on the likelihood of success on the merits and enquired whether the requested measures would disproportionately burden the other party. At any rate, the Claimants submit that they satisfy all the requirements and that this Tribunal should therefore grant the provisional measures sought.\n\n**a. Rights requiring protection**\n----------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nFor the Claimants, the power of the Tribunal to grant provisional measures is \"very broad\" and extends to procedural rights in addition to substantive rights.11 Pending the outcome of the arbitration, the rights that are subject to the arbitration must be protected if necessary by provisional measures. The Claimants submit that Indonesia's threats to commence criminal proceedings imperil three types of self-standing rights: (i) the right to the exclusivity of these ICSID proceedings; (ii) the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute; and (iii) the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 27.\n\n11.\n\nIt is through the actions of Indonesia that these rights \"imminently stand to be violated\" with respect to \"actual and potential witnesses\".12 While acknowledging that these witnesses and potential witnesses are not parties to these proceedings and thus not vested with these rights, the fact that the Claimants seek the protection of these rights \"does not amount to arguing that the non-parties in question also hold the same rights\".13\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*i. Right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention \"establishes the autonomy and exclusivity of ICSID arbitration from local administrative or judicial remedies\".14 According to the Claimants, Indonesia's threats and initiation of criminal proceedings on the basis of allegations of forgery are inconsistent with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. This is so because the allegations of forgery now investigated in Indonesia are the same allegations as those put forward by Indonesia as a defense in these ICSID proceedings.\n\nReply, \u00b6 48.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants refer to decisions in which tribunals have enjoined pending court proceedings in order \"to preserve a party's right to have the dispute decided by an international tribunal without having its rights eviscerated before an award on the merits\".15 In *Quiborax* and *Burlington*, the tribunals held that there could be no doubt that the right to exclusivity of ICSID proceedings may be protected by provisional measures.16 Criminal investigations and prosecution are prohibited under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention \"if they relate to the subject matter of the base before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous matters\".17 Since the question of allegedly forged documents squarely falls within the subject matter of the present dispute, Indonesia must await the resolution by this Tribunal and refrain from pursuing local proceedings, in particular criminal proceedings focused at obtaining evidence in support of their defense strategy.18\n\nReply, \u00b6 49.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, citing *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. & Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

CLA-194**).\n\n15.\n\nIn the present case, the allegations of forgery made by Indonesia in the criminal investigation are identical to those that Indonesia appears to intend to raise in these ICSID proceedings. Resorting to local proceedings after having raised the issue of forgery in the ICSID arbitration breaches Article 26 of the ICSID Convention; Indonesia is not at liberty to resort to domestic proceedings unless and until the Tribunal renders is final ruling.21\n\nReply, \u00b6 51.\n\n*ii. Right to the preservation of the status quo and the non-aggravation of the dispute*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants invoke a right to be free of criminal proceedings or threats of such proceedings and of any undue influence exerted by Indonesia on the Claimants\u2019 witnesses. Furthermore, the Claimants also invoke the right to present their claims before this Tribunal \"unobstructed by intimidation or detention of their witnesses\".22 In light of the fact that the criminal proceedings threatened and initiated are \"clearly motivated by and aimed at the present arbitration\", the requested measures would ensure the preservation of the *status quo* and prevent the aggravation of the dispute.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 46.\n\n17.\n\nVarious tribunals have recognized the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute, in particular to avoid the \"continued harassment and intimidation\" such as the one faced by the Claimants, their witnesses, and \"persons associated with the Claimants\u2019 investment in Indonesia\".23 In *Burlington*, the tribunal held these rights to be \"self-standing\" rights,24 and in *City Oriente,* the tribunal ordered Ecuador to stop pursuing administrative and criminal proceedings as a means to pressure the claimant.25\n\nApplication, \u00b6 40, referring to *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium v.

CLA-181**).\n\n18.\n\nIn addition to Mr. Benjamin, whom lead counsel of Indonesia directly threatened of criminal investigation at the hearing on jurisdiction, current and former employees of the Claimants still working and residing in Indonesia and certain of the Claimants\u2019 key witnesses, such as Messrs. Gunter, Gartman and Gibbs, are presently at risk of criminal investigation. This causes \"extraordinary stress and mental anguish to the Claimants and their witnesses\",26 and it is reasonable to presume - so the Claimants submit - that the same is also true of \"all persons currently or previously associated with the Claimants\u2019 investment in Indonesia\".27\n\nApplication, \u00b6 47.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*iii. Right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Indonesia\u2019s threat and initiation of criminal proceedings will substantially, if not totally, impair their access to witnesses and evidence and thereby affect their due process right to present their case.28\n\nApplication, \u00b6 49.\n\n20.\n\nArguing that the factual scenario in *Quiborax* is \"directly analogous\" to the present one, the Claimants stress that the *Quiborax* tribunal acknowledged that criminal proceedings could indeed prejudice the capacity of a party to present its case, in particular with respect to its access to documentary evidence and witnesses. The *Quiborax* tribunal also noted the troubling effect of criminal proceedings on potential witnesses and their willingness to cooperate in arbitral proceedings.29 Just as in *Quiborax,* Indonesia\u2019s use of its criminal system threatens the integrity of the ICSID proceedings.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 50-55; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 61-65, referring to *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n21.\n\nThe fact that none of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses has been prosecuted or imprisoned to date does not distinguish the present case from *Quiborax,* since the main purpose of provisional measures is to preserve the *status quo* pending a decision on the merits, *i.e.,* to ensure that no irreparable harm occurs in the first place. In any event, Indonesia\u2019s filing of criminal charges against Ridlatama on 21 March 2014 is sufficient to demonstrate that the threats proffered at the hearing on jurisdiction against Mr. Benjamin \"were not merely hot air\". Therefore, the Claimants are \"deeply concerned\" that Indonesia will shortly initiate criminal proceedings against them, their local subsidiary PT ICD, and their witnesses or potential witnesses.30\n\nApplication, \u00b6 58.\n\n22.\n\nIn *Quiborax*, while the tribunal found a threat to the procedural integrity of the arbitration to exist, it specifically declined to award provisional measures to preserve the *status quo* and prevent the non-aggravation of the dispute on the grounds that the claimants had ceased all activities and presence in Bolivia at the time when the criminal proceedings were instituted and that the targets of the criminal proceedings were no longer living in Bolivia.31 By contrast, in the present case, the Claimants are still present in Indonesia and several of their witnesses and potential witnesses, including Messrs. Benjamin, Gunther, Gartman and Gibbs, still reside and work in Indonesia.32\n\nReply, \u00b6 66.\n\nReply, \u00b6 67.\n\n23.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"Indonesia\u2019s threats already caused disruption during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, and the Regent of East Kutai\u2019s renewed and publicized threats and actions have aggravated the dispute and caused apprehension among the Claimants\u2019 witnesses, who are liable to become unavailable upon the formal filing of criminal charges against them\".33 In conclusion, the Claimants argue that there is a \"clear and imminent threat\" to the integrity of the proceedings, most notably to the Claimants\u2019 right to access evidence and present their case through witness testimony.34\n\n*Id*.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 59.\n\n**b.** ***Prima facie*** **case**\n---------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nReferring to the *Paushok* decision, which undertook a *prima facie* review of the merits as alleged in the claimant\u2019s memorial,35 the Claimants submit that the factual and legal bases set out in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial and the present application establish a *prima facie* case on the merits, thus fulfilling this particular requirement for the granting of provisional measures.36\n\n*Sergei Paushok & Ors. v. Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 55 (**Exh. CLA-186**).\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\n**c. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n25.\n\nFor the Claimants, there is \"real urgency\" for this Tribunal to recommend the requested provisional measures, since there is a \"real risk that action prejudicial to the rights\" of the Claimants might be taken before the Tribunal could make its final determination. The filing of criminal charges against Ridlatama combined with the continued threat of criminal proceedings against the Claimants and their witnesses \"will result in imminent harm\" to the Claimants and their witnesses, thus making the requested measures urgent.37\n\nApplication, \u00b6 64.\n\n26.\n\nAs stated in *Quiborax,* the measures seeking to protect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, maintain the *status quo,* prevent the aggravation of the dispute, and protect the integrity of the arbitration, are \"urgent by definition\".38 Or, as noted in *Burlington,* \"when the measures are intended to protect against the aggravation of the dispute during the proceedings, the urgency requirement is fulfilled by definition\".39\n\nApplication, \u00b6 65; Reply, \u00b6 77, citing *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 153 (**Exh. CLA-170**); and further referring to *City Oriente v.

Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 74 (**Exh. CLA-173**).\n\n27.\n\nHence, the threshold for proving urgency \"is low and can be met if the underlying right to be protected is of high importance\".40 In the present situation, like in *City Oriente,* the threat and initiation of the criminal investigations exercise pressure aggravating and extending the dispute, while at the same time impairing the rights which the Claimants seek to protect.41\n\nReply, \u00b6 76.\n\nReply, \u00b6 80.\n\n**d. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the requirement of necessity is fulfilled if the provisional measures are required to \"avoid harm or prejudice being inflicted upon the applicant\".42 The Tribunal should follow the standard enshrined in Article 17A of the UNCITRAL Model Law and applied by the *Quiborax* tribunal pursuant to which \"harm not adequately repaired by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered\" and satisfy itself that such harm \"substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted\".43\n\nApplication, \u00b6 67, referring to *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 155 (**Exh. CLA-170**); *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, \u00b6 8 (**Exh. CLA-176**).\n\nApplication, \u00b6 67.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that Indonesia\u2019s actions will necessarily cause harm which could not be adequately repaired by an award on damages, since they will not have access to evidence and witnesses to support their case. The requested measures are also proportional since the Claimants would suffer irreparable harm while Indonesia would incur no harm if the criminal proceedings are stayed. Indeed, Indonesia would be at liberty to investigate and prosecute eventual crimes once this arbitration concludes, as Indonesia conceded at the hearing on jurisdiction when it indicated that the statute of limitations for the offences now alleged by Indonesia is 12 years.\n\n30.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent\u2019s own account of its criminal procedure shows that the Claimants\u2019 will suffer irreparable harm. As acknowledged by the Respondent, during a criminal investigation, the investigative authority is competent \"to carry out an examination, to arrest, place in custody, search, seize documents and summon a person to be heard or examined as a suspect or witness\".44 Further, once the investigation is completed, the prosecutor may file a letter of indictment \"with a request that the case be promptly adjudicated\".45 Hence, \"persons associated with Ridlatama, and potentially other important witnesses in this arbitration, could have their documents seized and could be searched or summoned, arrested and placed in custody\".46 For instance, under the Indonesian criminal procedure, a person suspected of document forgery may be detained during the investigation for up to 60 days; upon assignment of the case to the prosecutor, a further 50 days; and if the matter reaches a court, the trial judge may extend the detention up to 90 days; the Court of Appeal may then do so for 90 additional days; and the Supreme Court an additional 110 days; totaling potentially 400 days of detention prior to a final and binding decision.\n\nReply, \u00b6 20, citing Response, \u00b6 19.\n\nReply, \u00b6 20, citing Response, \u00b6 22.\n\nReply, \u00b6 21.\n\n31.\n\nIn this context, Indonesia\u2019s attempts to dismiss the anxiety now incurred by the Claimants\u2019 witnesses disregard not only the legal consequences attached to a criminal investigation, but also Indonesia\u2019s own \"dismal record in affording due process to individuals under police investigation\".47 The Claimants point to two reports by Amnesty International referring to excessive police violence and other human rights violations.48 It is therefore incorrect for the Respondent to state that the Claimants\u2019 witnesses need only \"fear the prospect of giving evidence\". While the Claimants\u2019 witnesses do not fear answering Indonesia\u2019s unfounded allegations, they \"must and do fear police raids and abuse, property seizure and loss of their personal liberty for many months even if they have committed no crime\".49\n\nReply, \u00b6 23.\n\nReply, \u00b6 23, referring to Amnesty International, \"Excessive Force: Impunity for Police Violence in Indonesia\", p. 2 available at http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA21/010/2012/en/4e9322f8-5dd3-4e81-9f6b-3be702934d5e/asa210102012en.pdf (**Exh.

C-372**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 24.\n\n32.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the requested measures would immunize entities or individuals having committed a crime, the Claimants retort that Indonesia itself acknowledged at the hearing that the statute of limitations for the crime of document forgery is 12 years. Hence, there can be no question of immunity since \"Indonesia will still be able to exercise its power to investigate and prosecute alleged crimes upon the conclusion of the ICSID proceedings\".50\n\nReply, \u00b6 25.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, the Respondent is wrong to assert that provisional measures are confined to situations where specific performance is required. Indonesia\u2019s reliance on *Plama, Cemex* and *Occidental* is misleading, since Indonesia\u2019s position has been explicitly rejected in various cases, such as *Paushok* and *Saipem,* where the concepts of \"substantial\" or \"irreparable\" harm have been deemed flexible and \"not necessarily requir[ing] that the injury complained of be not remediable by an award on damages\".51 By contrast, in *Cemex,* the claimants sought to prevent Venezuela from seizing maritime vessels and financial assets while admitting that the only consequence of the seizure would be a financial loss. Similarly, in *Plama* and *Occidental,* the respondent\u2019s actions \"merely increased the monetary damages resulting from an already existing dispute\".52 In \"sharp contrast\" to these three cases, the criminal investigation initiated by Indonesia impairs the Claimants\u2019 right to procedural integrity, \"in particular with respect to their access to evidence, the unfettered freedom and willingness of witnesses to testify, and their fundamental due process right to present their case generally\".53\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 70-72, citing *Sergei Paushok v.

Indonesia, so the Claimants submit, has \"no protectable right to threaten or actually pursue criminal proceedings for an illicit purpose such as intimidation, undue influence, or other ulterior motives\".55 Accordingly, the Tribunal should grant the Claimants\u2019 requested provisional measures.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 72.\n\n*Id*.\n\n**2. Position of the Respondent**\n---------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the Claimants are wrong to allege that the criminal investigation initiated upon the request of the Government of the Regency of East Kutai is a \"strong-arm tactic\" used to derail or obstruct the present proceedings.56 Nor is this action taken impetuously \"in bad faith and for no legitimate purpose\".57 In addition to the 2009 BPK Audit Report that already identified indications of forgery, further concerns have surfaced regarding other documents produced by the Claimants in the course of this arbitration, making recourse to criminal proceedings inevitable under Indonesian law.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 2.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\n36.\n\nFor the Respondent, the criminal investigation is \"the only proper way to get to the bottom of this matter\", which \"would have been initiated even if the Tribunal had declined to exercise jurisdiction\".58 Indonesia adds that this is so \"because only the competent Indonesian authorities have access to all of the witnesses, including the Ridlatama companies and their principals, and only they have the powers to investigate and prosecute violations of the applicable Indonesian laws\".59 The Claimants also err in charging Indonesia with bad faith or intimidation, pointing to the absence of evidence of any purported pressure, harassment or undue influence of their witnesses. The criminal investigation initiated in March 2014 is at the first stages; it is \"sheer speculation\" to predict its outcome \"and certainly impossible to show that it will in any way derail or obstruct this Arbitration\".60\n\nResponse, \u00b6 3.\n\n*Id*.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 4.\n\n37.\n\nFor Indonesia, none of the proposed provisional measures is warranted under applicable legal standards. Only the right to the integrity of the arbitration is arguably implicated in this case. However, the Claimants have failed to show that the inchoate criminal investigation \"has impinged in any way on the ability of Claimants to present their case to this Tribunal\".61 The Respondent recalls that arbitral tribunals have stressed that provisional remedies are extraordinary measures which should not be granted lightly, in particular when it comes to restraining a sovereign to investigate and prosecute crimes within its jurisdiction.62 The burden of showing that provisional measures are urgent and necessary to avoid irreparable harm rests with the Claimants. Where evidence is lacking, the requested measures must be denied.63\n\nResponse, \u00b6 6.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 29; Rejoinder, \u00b6 24; referring to *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v.

RLA-133**)\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 38.\n\n40.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent submits that the factual circumstances do not warrant provisional measures.\n\n41.\n\nFirst, the remarks of Counsel at the hearing on jurisdiction can hardly be characterized as a \"threat\" or a \"campaign\".71 Counsel merely confirmed Indonesia\u2019s \"long-standing intention\" to initiate a criminal investigation into the \"Ridlatama forged documents\", which had only been deferred because Indonesia expected a swift dismissal of the ICSID arbitrations. As to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s role, Counsel only stated that his role with respect to the licenses had been put \"on the record\" and that he should \"be prepared to explain the irregularities identified in the documents\".72\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 8.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 10.\n\n42.\n\nSecond, as to the timing of the investigation, it is clear from Mr. Dermawan\u2019s comments at the hearing, that the decision to commence a criminal investigation had already been taken. The fact that it was deferred while the jurisdictional objections were pending \"is of no moment\".73 In any event, the Claimants themselves acknowledged at the hearing that \"the irregularities in the license documentation, if indicative of forgery, warrant criminal investigation\".74 In the end, \"Claimants cannot be in a better position today than they would have been if the request for a criminal inquiry had been initiated immediately after the Hearing\".75\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 11.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 12, referring to Tr. 14052013, 105:16-17 (\"No issue was taken against the claimants in two and a half or more years, until we get the allegations being suggested in the context of these proceedings, that these documents are not authentic in some way, when there has been plenty of opportunity to investigate it\").\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 11.\n\n43.\n\nThird, the Claimants are wrong when they state that being subject to criminal investigation and possible detention constitutes by definition irreparable harm. The Claimants\u2019 reliance on two Amnesty International reports is to no avail since these reports deal with very different circumstances involving mass protests and do not deal with so-called \"white collar\" crimes.76 Furthermore, to the Claimants\u2019 argument regarding the chilling effect on potential witnesses the Respondent answers that the \"Claimants cannot possibly be prejudiced by an investigation of the Ridlatama principals\" whom Churchill itself has described as \"sharks\" in the context of its various lawsuits against Ridlatama.77 In addition, Mr. Benjamin has not been accused of a crime, nor have the Claimants alleged that he has been interrogated by the police or \"told that he is anything more than a witness\".78 The fact that his conduct will be scrutinized \"does not mean that his rights will be abused or that he will be prevented from testifying\" in the present proceedings.79\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 18.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 19.\n\n*Id*.\n\n44.\n\nFourth, granting the relief sought by the Claimants could amount to complete immunity from criminal investigation and prosecution \"for all of the Churchill/Ridlatma 'business partners\u2019\",80 and would inflict irreparable harm on the Respondent by precluding it to uncover \"evidence that would be relevant, and perhaps decisive, for the merits of this arbitration\".81 Thus, by granting the requested measures the Tribunal would in fact be prejudging the merits of this dispute.82\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 22.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 21.\n\n*Id*.\n\n**a. Rights for which protection is requested**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 choice to structure the Application by repeating the same arguments presented in the *Quiborax* case is of no assistance because the tribunal in that case (i) rejected similar arguments \"on grounds that equally apply here\" and (ii) granted provisional measures for exceptional circumstances not present here. For the Respondent, *Quiborax* is not at all analogous to the present case and does not support the extraordinary relief sought by the Claimants.\n\n*i. The right to the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nFor the Respondent, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention is not infringed through the initiation of criminal proceedings by the Regent of East Kutai, since \"there are two exclusive remedies to be obtained from two distinct forums\".83 The jurisdiction of Indonesia\u2019s criminal authorities and that of this Tribunal do not overlap; and both \"possess distinct legal competence over their respective matters\".84\n\nResponse, \u00b6 54.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 55.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the Claimants have no ongoing business activities in Indonesia and only seek monetary damages as remedy in this arbitration. In contrast, the purpose of the criminal investigation is \"to uncover the truth about the suspect documents utilized by the Ridlatama group to carry out its mining business\".85 While no criminal charges have yet been asserted, the remedy would be criminal sanctions, which fall beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n*Id*.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s, CSOB* and *Zhinvali* is ill-founded. Although, in a first order the CSOB tribunal directed the Ukrainian authorities to abstain from, suspend or discontinue, any proceedings before domestic courts, it thereafter refused to uphold a request to stop criminal proceedings against the general director of the claimant\u2019s subsidiaries in Ukraine.86 For the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 failure to quote *Quiborax* on this particular issue is noteworthy. In that case, the tribunal held that the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings does not extend to criminal proceedings, since the latter deal with matters outside ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.87\n\nResponse, \u00b6 53.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 55, citing *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 128-129 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n49.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal should follow other tribunals and look to \"the nature of the causes of action and relief sought in the investment arbitration\". For instance, the *CSOB* and *Zhinvali* tribunals held that the domestic proceedings infringed Article 26 of the ICSID Convention because these proceedings dealt with the same issues as those before those submitted to arbitration, a situation that must be distinguished from the present one.88\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 49, referring to *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Procedural Order No. 4, 11 January 1999 (**Exh. CLA-178**); *Zhinvali v. Georgia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1, Award, 24 January 2003 (**Exh. CLA-194**).\n\n*ii. The right to the preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute is subject to the requirements of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm.89 Here, the Claimants \"fail to explain how the forgery investigation alters the *status quo* and aggravates the dispute in such a way that it impedes their ability to present their treaty claim before this Tribunal\".90\n\nResponse, \u00b6 57, referring to *Occidental v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, \u00b6 61 (**Exh. CLA-183**).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 56.\n\n51.\n\nVarious tribunals have insisted on the requirements of necessity and urgency. For instance, the *Plama* tribunal held that the *status quo* must be preserved \"when a change of circumstances threatens the ability of the Arbitral Tribunal to grant the relief which a party seeks and the capability of giving effect to the relief\u2019.91 Therefore, argues the Respondent, \"a party's entitlement to preserving the *status quo* and non-aggravation of an arbitration proceeding is ancillary to the requirements for issuing provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention\".92\n\nResponse, \u00b6 58, citing *Plama v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 45 (**Exh. CLA-172**); also referring to *Cemex v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 3 March 2010, \u00b6 61 (**Exh. RLA-138**).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 58.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent also points to the case law of the Permanent Court of International Justice (the \"PCIJ\") and its successor, the International Court of Justice (the \"ICJ\"), where the right to preserve the *status quo* and non-aggravation was recognized, albeit in the context of \"non-commercial cases involving potential loss of human life, threat of armed aggression, fear of genocide or on-going humanitarian violations, none of which could be remedied by monetary compensation\".93 Significantly, in *Pulp Mills,* the ICJ refused to indicate provisional measures relating to the non-aggravation of the dispute since it found no imminent risk of irreparable harm.94\n\nResponse, \u00b6 59.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 60, referring to *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*, Provisional Measures, Order, 23 January 2007, ICJ Reports 2007, p. 16, \u00b6 49.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Quiborax* and *City Oriente* is ill-founded; these cases must be distinguished. Even if *Quiborax* and others recognize that the right to preserve the *status quo* and non-aggravation is a a \"self-standing right\", that tribunal held that the criminal proceedings did not alter the *status quo* and therefore did not order provisional measures on this ground.95 The same is true of *Burlington,* which recognized the selfstanding nature of the right in question, but noted that its preservation through provisional measures was only warranted if urgent and necessary.96*City Oriente,* for the Respondent, presents a totally different scenario from the present one in that Ecuador sought payment under a new law which was at issue in that arbitration, and the tribunal held that the criminal proceedings should be suspended since they stemmed from the non-payment under the new law.97 Here, to the contrary, the Claimants have no ongoing investments in Indonesia and they only seek monetary relief, not specific performance. In addition, the Respondent argues that it has a right to conduct \"legitimate criminal investigations of serious allegations of forgery that arose prior to the start of these arbitration proceedings\".98\n\nResponse, \u00b6 61, referring to *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 138 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 63, citing *Burlington v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 51 (**Exh. CLA-173**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 54, referring to *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, 19 November 2007, \u00b6 63 (**Exh. CLA-181**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 55.\n\n54.\n\nTo sum up, the Respondent submits the following:\n\n\"In this case, the alleged aggravating circumstances consist of a criminal investigation of a non-party to this dispute and the purported harassment, mental anguish and intimidation that Claimants claim to be suffered by their witnesses and 'potential witnesses\u2019. In truth, Claimants have not even been interviewed. Nor have Claimants supplied any evidence, much less an affidavit or statement from any of their witnesses, that they are unwilling or unable to testify in the arbitration. There can be no relief for aggravation of the dispute if no aggravation has been demonstrated\".99\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 57.\n\n*iii. The right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nBy invoking the right to the integrity of the arbitration as a separate ground, the Claimants \"have taken on the burden of demonstrating bad faith and an illicit purpose on the part of the Republic designed, not to investigate the *bona fides* of the allegedly forged documents, but rather to frustrate Claimants\u2019 ability to prosecute their case\".100 Additionally, the Claimants must show that the mere commencement of criminal proceedings \"without more, constitutes an imminent threat to their access to evidence or their witnesses\" in these proceedings.101 On both counts, the evidence before the Tribunal is insufficient to make such a showing.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 66; Rejoinder, \u00b6 44.\n\n*Id*.\n\n56.\n\n*Quiborax,* on which the Claimants rely, must be distinguished. In that case, Bolivia initiated criminal proceedings after the ICSID proceedings had commenced as a defense strategy in the latter proceedings.102 Unlike here, the conclusion reached by the *Quiborax* tribunal was supported by a \"robust factual record\",103*i.e.,* by documents in the criminal proceedings making express reference to the ICSID arbitration and thus showing a direct link between the two proceedings.104 In the present case, the forgery allegations predate the commencement of the ICSID proceedings \"and were the subject of long-standing governmental concern\", as demonstrated by the BKP audit of February 2009 and the reiterations for clarification issued by the Regency of East Kutai \"before they [i.e. the Claimants] filed their Request for Arbitration before ICSID\".105\n\nResponse, \u00b6 67, referring to *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 121 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 45.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 67.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 68.\n\n57.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it was already apparent to the Tribunal since the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction that \"there are very serious questions as to the authenticity of the documents secured by Claimants\u2019 former business partners, on which Claimants rely in this proceeding\".106 The Claimants themselves acknowledged that a criminal investigation is the normal procedure by which evidence of a suspected forgery is collected.107 The Respondent also points to the lack of plenary power of this Tribunal \"to examine all persons with potential knowledge of the true facts\" and to compel the production of evidence from persons employed by the Claimants or Ridlatama, other than the Claimants\u2019 witnesses in these proceedings:108 \"Just as the Tribunal has its own role in resolving the treaty dispute over which it has assumed jurisdiction, so too does the Republic have a responsibility to adhere to its internal law enforcement procedures in investigating and prosecuting conduct in violation of its domestic laws. Surely, Claimants have no protectable right to immunize or shelter entities or persons who have committed crimes\".109\n\nResponse, \u00b6 69.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n58.\n\nThe present case must be further distinguished from *Quiborax* for the following reasons.\n\n59.\n\nFirst, Indonesia\u2019s conduct in initially holding off the investigation is the \"polar opposite\" of Bolivia\u2019s behavior in *Quiborax.*110 The forgery allegations were made by a Governmental audit body, not lead counsel in the present proceedings. Counsel\u2019s comments during the hearing on jurisdiction \"reflected a legal determination by counsel that an investigation should be deferred, not because it was unwarranted, but rather because of a concern that it would lead to very sorts of reckless allegations made by Claimants in their Application\".111 For Indonesia, regardless of the Tribunal\u2019s rulings on jurisdiction, there can be no doubt that a criminal investigation would have been set in motion.112\n\nResponse, \u00b6 70.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n60.\n\nSecond, the facts underlying *Quiborax* are different from the present ones. The Claimants here have full access to their books and records, as well as to all the documents and testimony provided by their witnesses. The Claimants do not allege being deprived of their documentation as a result of the investigation; they \"have enjoyed full freedom in presenting their case\".113\n\nResponse, \u00b6 71.\n\n61.\n\nThird, the Claimants are wrong in arguing that, like in *Quiborax*, the criminal proceedings were initiated by the Government officials who are mandated with Indonesia\u2019s defense in this arbitration. While the Government of the Regency of East Kutai is the complaining party, it is not the investigative body in the ongoing investigation and the Minister of Law and Human Rights of the Republic was not involved in filing the criminal complaint nor is he responsible for the investigation or prosecution of any suspected crimes. In sum, \"the fact that certain government officials may have relevant knowledge and interest in this Arbitration as a result of their ordinary scope of authority is hardly grounds for insinuating interference\".114\n\nResponse, \u00b6 72.\n\n62.\n\nFinally, the Claimants have offered nothing to explain why the mere commencement of an investigation of Ridlatama has put an \"intolerable pressure\" on the Claimants\u2019 witnesses or potential witnesses leading them to withdraw from this arbitration. Provisional measures cannot be issued on the basis of speculation; they require a showing of imminent harm.115\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 46.\n\n**b. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent cites commentators and decisions pursuant to which provisional measures are only indicated \"if it is impossible to wait for a specific issue to be settled at the merits stage\".116 The Respondent stresses that the Claimants recognize that urgency requires more than harm, namely a showing of a real risk of imminent harm.117 This follows from the Claimants' argument that the harm to their witnesses is imminent because criminal charges have been lodged against the Ridlatama group and therefore charges against the Claimants are \"likely to follow\".118 The Respondent contends, however, that \"there is no evidence that any such charges have been asserted against either the Ridlatama principals or Claimants\u2019 witnesses\".119 It adds that nothing in the ongoing investigation prevents the Claimants from presenting evidence in these proceedings.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 26, citing *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, 19 November 2007, \u00b6 67 (**Exh. CLA-181**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 26, also referring to *Occidental v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, \u00b6 89 (**Exh. CLA-183**); *Burimi v. Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, 3 May 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35 (**Exh. RLA-130**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 27.\n\n*Id*.\n\n**c. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n64.\n\nRelying on *Occidental Petroleum* and *Cemex*, the Respondent argues that irreparable harm is an essential requirement, which tribunals have found to be missing \"where the alleged prejudice or harm can be compensated by damages\".120 The applicable test therefore is whether, absent provisional measures, the Claimants would lose the ability to recover monetary damages.121 For instance, the *Plama* tribunal refused to order the discontinuance of insolvency proceedings, accepting that harm is not irreparable if it can be made good through damages.122 The \"same is true where there is no ongoing contractual relationship that Claimants seek to maintain and the remedy sought by Claimants consists solely of money damages\".123\n\nResponse, \u00b6 45, referring to *Occidental v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 61 (**Exh. CLA-183**); *Cemex v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 3 March 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49 (**Exh. RLA-138**).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 49.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 46, referring to *Plama v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (**Exh. CLA-172**).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 47.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants are wrong in criticizing the irreparable harm test and arguing instead for a test of significant harm, the latter having only been applied in exceptional cases to preserve ongoing contractual relationships where the harm could not be remedied by damages.124 As stated in *Cemex*, the tribunals in *City Oriente*, *Perenco*, and *Burlington* \"could have based their decision on the fact that, the destruction of the ongoing concern that constituted the investment, would have created an 'irreparable harm'\".125 In any event, although they deny the need for irreparable harm, the Claimants nonetheless argue \u2013 albeit erroneously \u2013 that the initiation of the criminal investigation does meet that standard.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 29, referring to *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, 19 November 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60 (**Exh. CLA-181**); *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) (\"Perenco v. Ecuador & Petroecuador\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, \u00b6 46, 53 (**Exh. CLA-169**); and *Burlington v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 83 (**Exh. CLA-173**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 30, citing *Cemex v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, 3 March 2010, \u00b6 55 (**Exh. RLA-138**).\n\n66.\n\nIn respect of the \"extraordinary stress and mental anguish\" to which the Claimants' witnesses are allegedly subject, the Claimants fail to identify any actual or imminent harm. As in *Occidental*, the Tribunal should refrain from ordering provisional measures that would cause irreparable harm to the other party, specifically to a sovereign State's power to investigate and prosecute criminal behavior: \"However anxiety-provoking the fear of the unknown may be \u2013 so the Respondent submits \u2013, the trepidation of Claimants' witnesses as to what may occur in the investigation is inherently speculative, and cannot be the basis for provisional measures that would have the effect of halting a legitimate investigation into conduct in violation of Indonesia's law\".126 Contrary to the Claimants' submission, suspending the investigation for an indefinite period of time \"would be highly prejudicial to the Republic and to the integrity of the criminal justice system\".127\n\nResponse, \u00b6 48 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id*.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n**1. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n67.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules enable the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures. Article 47 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n68.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in relevant parts the following:\n\n1) At any time during the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**2. Requirements for Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAccording to Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the request must specify \"the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures\". Various ICSID tribunals have interpreted these requirements to mean that provisional measures must (i) serve to protect certain rights of the applicant, (ii) meet the requirement of urgency; and (iii) the requirement of128 necessity, which implies the existence of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm.\n\nSee *Plama v. Bulgaria*, Order on Provisional Measures of 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38; *Burlington v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 51 (**Exh. CLA-173**); *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/02, Decision on Provisional Measures of 26 February 2010, \u00b6 113 (**Exh.****CLA-170**); *Iona Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures of 2 March 2011, \u00b6 12.\n\n70.\n\nWhile there is common ground between the Parties on the first two requirements, they disagree on whether the third requirement entails a showing of irreparable harm as opposed to substantial harm. The Parties further disagree on the fulfillment *in casu* of the three requirements referred to above, specifically whether the rights for which protection is sought are affected (a. below) and whether the measures requested are urgent (b. below) and necessary (c. below).\n\n71.\n\nBefore addressing these requirements, the Tribunal stresses that the applicant must establish the requirements with sufficient likelihood, without however having to actually prove the facts underlying them. Moreover, the Tribunal's assessment is necessarily made on the basis of the record as it presently stands and any conclusion reached in this order could be reviewed if relevant circumstances were to change.\n\n**a. Existence of Rights Requiring Preservation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the following three rights need preservation by way of provisional measures: (i) the right to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention; (ii) the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute; and (iii) the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration.\n\n73.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal will deal with Indonesia's contention that the rights that may be protected by way of provisional measures must belong to a Party, must exist at the time of the Application, and must not be hypothetical or future rights ((i) below). The Tribunal will then review the right to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings ((ii) below), the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute ((iii) below), and the right to the integrity of the arbitration ((iv) below).\n\n*i. The holder of the rights requiring protection*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nAlthough Indonesia does not dispute that the three rights invoked by the Claimants may be protected by way of provisional measures, it argues that under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, provisional measures may only be issued if the rights of a disputing party are at issue.129 Relying in particular on *Maffezini*, the Respondent further argues that such rights \"must be actual, existing rights at the time the request is made and 'must not be hypothetical, nor are ones to be created in the future'\".130\n\nResponse, \u00b6 35.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 35, citing *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 October 1999, \u00b6 13 (**Exh. CLA-177**).\n\n75.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants preemptively seek to protect not only themselves, but also their witnesses and \"any person associated with the Claimants' operations in Indonesia\", i.e. the Claimants' current and former employees, affiliates or business partners. The Claimants therefore seek protection of an indefinite number of third parties, making it impossible to determine in what way the Claimants' ability to present their case is affected.\n\n76.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention to grant provisional measures to protect the rights of the Ridlatama companies and their principals. The same applies to other non-parties in this arbitration, \"including entities or individuals who previously were associated with Claimants or who have [appeared] or may appear as witnesses in this Arbitration\".131\n\nResponse, \u00b6 38.\n\n77.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue that they are the owners of the rights for which they seek protection, not third parties. They further maintain that these rights stand to be violated by the Respondent vis-\u00e0-vis actual and potential witnesses.\n\n78.\n\nIt is common ground in the ICSID framework that the rights to be protected by provisional measures must belong to a disputing party. This derives from the plain words of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which refers to the preservation of \"the respective rights of either party\". It is also clear from Rule 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules which allows a disputing party to request provisional measures \"for the preservation of *its* rights\" (emphasis added).\n\n79.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants are not seeking provisional measures to protect rights of non-parties. Rather, they seek to protect their own rights in the present proceedings. More specifically, the Claimants seek to secure their right to provide evidence through witness testimony. To this end, they seek to avoid that such right be impaired by criminal investigations brought against actual and potential witnesses. The fact that the Claimants seek to protect their right to submit evidence through potential witnesses does not make this right hypothetical.\n\n*ii. The right to exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants argue that resort to criminal investigation and prosecution is contrary to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, thus rendering provisional measures necessary to preserve the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings. More specifically, the forgery allegations now investigated in Indonesia are part of the subject matter of the present dispute since these allegations appear to be Indonesia's defense strategy.\n\n81.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent replies that the remedies sought in the criminal investigation and this arbitration are distinct. It also refers to *Quiborax*, where the tribunal refused to hold that criminal proceedings threaten the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings.\n\n82.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Consent of the Parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy\".\n\n83.\n\nIt is undisputed that the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings is a procedural right which may find protection by way of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. As stated in *Tokios Tok\u00e9les* :\n\n\"Among the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative\".132\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, \u00b6 7 (**Exh. CLA-****176**). *See* further, *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 127 (**Exh. CLA-170**); *Burlington v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 57 (**Exh. CLA-173**).\n\n84.\n\nThe question which the Tribunal must address is whether the criminal investigation initiated in March 2014 as a result of the criminal charges lodged by the Regent of East Kutai on 21 March 2014 against the Ridlatama companies threatens the exclusivity of the present proceedings. The Tribunal must also determine whether the threat of criminal investigation and proceedings against the Claimants, their witnesses and potential witnesses breaches Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n85.\n\nAs a starting point, the Tribunal agrees with the *Quiborax* tribunal in that criminal proceedings do not *per se* threaten the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings.133 This derives from the fact that the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal extend to investment disputes, i.e. for present purposes, whether the Respondent breached its international obligations under the UK-Indonesia BIT with respect to Churchill Mining and under the Australia-Indonesia BIT with respect to Planet Mining, and not to criminal proceedings, which fall outside the scope of the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence.\n\n*Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 128 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n86.\n\nA breach of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention only occurs if a claim or right forming part of the subject matter of these proceedings is the object of parallel proceedings in another forum. In the present case, the subject matter of the criminal proceedings (to impose sanctions for the alleged criminal act of document forgery) and of the present arbitration (to grant monetary relief for alleged breaches of the investment treaty) are not the same. It is true that the Tribunal may have to consider documents allegedly forged in the context of its power to determine the admissibility and evidentiary weight of the evidence on record. Yet, this does not imply an identity of subject matter.134\n\n*Perenco v. Ecuador & Petroecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, \u00b6 61 (**Exh. CLA-169**).\n\n87.\n\nIn this light, the Tribunal finds that the criminal charges lodged by the Regent of East Kutai on 21 March 2014 against the Ridlatama companies do not threaten the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings. The Ridlatama companies are not parties to the present dispute, and a criminal investigation into their conduct with respect to the alleged document forgery does not impinge on the exclusivity of the present proceedings, nor does it undermine the Tribunal's jurisdiction to resolve the Claimants' claims.\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that no criminal proceedings have (yet) been instituted against the Claimants, their witnesses or potential witnesses. In these circumstances, there can be no question of a breach of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. The threat to initiate criminal proceedings voiced by Counsel, if it can be characterized as such, cannot change this conclusion.\n\n*iii. The right to the preservation of the status quo and the non-aggravation of the dispute*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent is employing criminal proceedings or related threats to intimidate the Claimants and their witnesses or potential witnesses, thus altering the *status quo* and aggravating the dispute. In particular, the Claimants contend that Indonesia's \"recurrent threats\" of criminal investigations cause \"extraordinary stress and mental anguish to the Claimants and their witnesses\",135 and presumably to \"all persons currently or previously associated with the Claimants' investment in Indonesia\".136 For its part, Indonesia retorts that the Claimants have failed to explain how the criminal proceedings have altered the *status quo* or aggravated the dispute such as to affect the Claimants' ability to present their case. Nor have the Claimants established that the requested measures are urgent and necessary.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 47.\n\n*Id*.\n\n90.\n\nIt is undisputed that the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute may find protection by way of provisional measures. As was held in *Burlington*, procedural rights may be preserved by provisional measures like substantive rights.137 The Tribunal agrees with previous decisions holding that within the ICSID framework the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute is a self-standing right vested in any party to ICSID proceedings.138\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 60 (**Exh.****CLA-173**).\n\n*City Oriente v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, 19 November 2007, \u00b6 55 (**Exh. CLA-181**); *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 134 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question whether Indonesia's actions have altered the *status quo* or aggravated the dispute. It notes the Claimants' allegation that the \"continued harassment and intimidation\" exerted by the Respondent targets three different groups of persons: the Claimants themselves; the Claimants' witnesses; and persons currently or previously associated with the Claimants' investment in Indonesia. The Tribunal will thus focus on each group of persons separately.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the threat or the initiation of criminal charges is not conducive to lowering the level of antagonism between the Parties. For the following reasons, the Tribunal does not find, however, that Indonesia's (intended) actions have altered the *status quo* or aggravated the dispute. With regard to the first two groups, the Tribunal notes that no investigation has been initiated nor have criminal charges been lodged against the Claimants or their current witnesses. The Tribunal further fails to see how the initiation of a criminal investigation against the Ridlatama companies which are not parties to the present dispute, has altered the *status quo* or aggravated the dispute in the present proceedings. While it is undeniable that the criminal charges lodged against the Ridlatama companies are related to the present arbitration, the Tribunal does not believe at this juncture that the Claimants' rights are affected.\n\n93.\n\nAs regards the \"extraordinary stress and mental anguish\" allegedly suffered by the Claimants and their witnesses, due to Indonesia's conduct, the Tribunal does not either find the initiation of criminal proceedings against Ridlatama to have altered the *status quo* or to have otherwise aggravated the dispute. There is no element on record showing any pressure or intimidation against the Claimants and their witnesses.\n\n94.\n\nAs regards Mr. Benjamin, it is true that counsel to Indonesia argued at the hearing on jurisdiction that he may have to respond to the Indonesian authorities about his involvement in the compilation of the documents the authenticity of which Indonesia now questions. However, there are no concrete elements in the record allowing to conclude that Indonesia is indeed contemplating the possibility of initiating a criminal investigation against Mr. Benjamin. In its latest submission, Indonesia stated that Mr. Benjamin was not accused of forgery at the hearing or thereafter by Indonesian authorities.139 While Mr. Benjamin may have to appear as a witness in the investigation initiated against the Ridlatama companies in light of his personal role in the collection of the documents that are now under investigation, this does not mean, absent further elements, that Mr. Benjamin is subject to undue pressure.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 19.\n\n95.\n\nWith respect to the third group, the Tribunal equally fails to see how the threat to initiate criminal investigations or proceedings against the unidentified third group of persons \"being currently or previously associated with the Claimants' investment in Indonesia\" has changed the *status quo* and aggravated the dispute.\n\n*iv. The right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's conduct impairs their right to the procedural integrity of these proceedings, in particular their \"fundamental due process right\" to present their case. In light of (i) the direct connection between Indonesia's conduct and the developments in these ICSID proceedings, (ii) the identity between the persons initiating the criminal investigation and those defending Indonesia in the present proceedings, and (iii) the timing of the Respondent's conduct, there is a clear and imminent threat to the procedural integrity of these proceedings.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent answers that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate bad faith or an illicit purpose on the part of Indonesia, not to investigate the *bona fides* of the alleged document forgery, but to frustrate the Claimants' ability to present their case. Nor did the Claimants show that the mere commencement of the criminal investigation constitutes an imminent threat to their access to evidence or to their witnesses.\n\n98.\n\nThe Parties do not disagree that the right to the integrity of arbitration proceedings may be protected by provisional measures. Both Parties rely on the *Quiborax* decision to reach opposite conclusions; the Claimants arguing that *Quiborax* is directly analogous to the present case, and the Respondent arguing that both cases must be distinguished.\n\n99.\n\nWhile presenting certain similarities, the Tribunal is of the view that *Quiborax* must be distinguished, since it dealt with actual criminal investigations against a co-claimant and persons involved in the setting up of the investment. As matters presently stand, the Tribunal considers that the impairment of the Claimants' procedural rights is speculative and hypothetical..\n\n**b. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Parties agree that the urgency requirement is satisfied if the relief requested cannot await the final award. They disagree, however, on whether this test is met in the present circumstances..\n\n101.\n\nSince the specific circumstances as they stand do not affect the Claimants' right to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings, their right to the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute, and their right to the procedural integrity of these proceedings, it follows that the urgency requirement is not fulfilled.\n\n**c. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n102.\n\nWhile the Parties agree that provisional measures must be necessary to avoid harm being inflicted upon the applicant, they disagree on the characterization of the harm. The Claimants argue that a risk of substantial harm is sufficient, while the Respondent insists on irreparable harm. The Respondent also contends that harm is not irreparable if it can be made good through damages.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal can dispense with entering into a discussion of the Parties' arguments. Since in the present circumstances, the rights for which the Claimants seek provisional measures are not affected, the necessity requirement is consequently not fulfilled.\n\n**d. Final Observations**\n-------------------------\n\n104.\n\nWhile the request for provisional measures must be denied, the Tribunal wishes to expressly stress the Parties' general duty, which arises from the principle of good faith, not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal that \"the Republic be awarded the costs associated with its opposition thereto, including its legal and administrative fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal\".140 Considering that it was not unreasonable under the circumstances to file the Application and in line with the practice adopted in earlier decisions and orders, the Tribunal will reserve the issue of costs for a later determination.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 76; Rejoinder, \u00b6 64.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n106.\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal issues the following decision:\n\n1) Denies the Claimants' Application for provisional measures;\n\n2) Costs are reserved for a later decision or award."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 14 Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2014-12-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 14 Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present order deals with an Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Application\") filed by Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd (the \"Claimants\") on 2 September 2014, by which the Claimants requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Recommend that the Republic of Indonesia (\"Indonesia\" or the \"Respondent\"), its agencies and instrumentalities:\n\ni. Refrain from threatening or commencing any criminal investigation or prosecution against the Claimants, their witnesses in these proceedings including Mr. Paul Benjamin, and employees or their wholly owned subsidiary, PT Indonesia Coal Development (PT ICD), pending the outcome of this arbitration;\n\nii. Return forthwith to PT ICD all documents and other items that were seized by the Indonesian police in the raid on PT ICD\u2019s premises on 29 August 2014;\n\niii. Stay or suspend any current criminal investigation or prosecution against the Claimants\u2019 and PT ICD\u2019s current and former employees pending the outcome of this arbitration;\n\niv. Refrain from engaging in any other conduct that would:\n\n1. Aggravate the dispute between the Parties;\n\n2. Alter the *status quo;* or\n\n3. Jeopardize the procedural integrity of these proceedings; and\n\n(b) Recommend any further measures or relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate in the circumstances to preserve the Claimants\u2019 rights.1\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, 2 September 2014, pp. 2-3.\n\n2.\n\nOn 5 September 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to file its response to the Application by 15 September 2014. The Tribunal further indicated that it would revert to the Parties with further directions once it had reviewed the Respondent\u2019s response to the Application.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Response to the Claimants\u2019 Application (the \"Response\") within the time limit. In its Response, Indonesia objected to the Application and requested the Tribunal to:\n\n(a) Reject the Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures; and\n\n(b) Award to the Respondent the costs associated with its opposition to the Application, including Indonesia\u2019s legal and administrative fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.2\n\nThe Republic of Indonesia\u2019s Response to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, 15 September 2014, p. 4.\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 September 2014, having reviewed the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit a reply by 26 September 2014 and the Respondent a rejoinder by 6 October 2014. The Tribunal further asked the Parties to state whether they requested a hearing on provisional measures and, if so, whether the hearing could be held by video link.3\n\nLetter of the Tribunal to the Parties, 17 September 2014, p. 2.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants filed their reply (\"Reply\") within the time limit. The Claimants added the following requests to their initial ones (see above paragraph 1):\n\n(a) Order, in the interests of due process and procedural integrity, Indonesia to provide full copies of all interview recordings, transcripts, and statements of any party or person that has been interviewed in connection with the criminal investigation into the alleged forgeries;4 and\n\n(b) Order Indonesia to produce a copy of all correspondence from and to the London Stock Exchange in respect of Indonesia\u2019s decision to deliver the Witness Statement of Mr. Russell Paul Hardwick.5\n\nReply, p. 2.\n\nReply, p. 3.\n\n6.\n\nFinally, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had fully made their case on provisional measures and that the Tribunal could decide on the Application on the basis of the documents. The Claimants nonetheless indicated their willingness to attend a hearing via video link should the Tribunal wish to hold a hearing.\n\n7.\n\nOn 6 October 2014, the Respondent filed its rejoinder (\"Rejoinder\"), essentially restating its request to deny the Application and award it the costs associated therewith.6\n\nRejoinder, p. 11 (emphasis as in original text). In its Application for the Dismissal of the Claimants\u2019 Claims dated 25 September 2014, the Respondent provided further observations regarding the Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures *(see* paragraphs 43-44, 46). In particular, the Respondent requested a hearing on the Claimants' Application and proposed that such hearing also deal with the Respondent\u2019s Application for the Dismissal of the Claimants' Claims (*see* paragraph 46). This request has not been reiterated in the Rejoinder.\n\n8.\n\nIn light of the Parties\u2019 submissions, and the geographic distribution of the Parties, counsel and arbitrators, the Tribunal decided on 14 October 2014 to hold a hearing via teleconference on 21 October 2014 at 1:00 pm CET to deal, *inter alia,* with the provisional measures. The Tribunal circulated the hearing schedule to the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 October 2014, the Parties and the Tribunal held the hearing as scheduled. During the hearing, the Claimants presented oral comments on the measures followed by the Respondent, and the Parties answered questions from the Tribunal.\n\n**II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of the Claimants**\n--------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the police raid on Friday 29 August 2014 of the Jakarta premises of the Claimants\u2019 wholly-owned Indonesian investment vehicle, PT ICD, and the seizure of various documents and hard drives, is the *\"third* instance where Indonesia uses its sovereign powers as a way of destabilizing the arbitration proceedings\".7 According to the Claimants, this raid was strategically timed to take place at the same time the Parties were attending in Singapore the Tribunal-ordered document inspection. Additionally, Indonesia intimidated and harassed the two employees of PT ICD present during the raid, as they were served with a summons to appear for questioning on 3 September 2014 and were indeed questioned by the Indonesian police \"for days on end\".8 For the Claimants, the use of such \"strong-arm tactics\" constitutes a \"new flagrant attempt by Indonesia to upset the playing field and derail this arbitration\", requiring an order of provisional measures against Indonesia.9\n\nApplication, p. 1.\n\nReply, p. 8.\n\nApplication, p. 2.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that Mr. Paul Benjamin, one of the Claimants\u2019 key witnesses, is \"now formally a suspect in Indonesia\u2019s criminal investigations\" regarding the alleged forgery of documents.10 While the Tribunal refused to order provisional measures in Procedural Order No. 9 because it found that Indonesia had not yet acted upon its threats of criminal prosecution against the Claimants, their employees, witnesses and potential witnesses in this arbitration, the circumstances have now changed in light of the raid on PT ICD, the seizure of documents and hard drives, the intimidation and harassment of PT ICD\u2019s employees, and the classification of Mr. Paul Benjamin as a suspect. In other words, provisional measures are now needed to further prevent Indonesia from destabilizing the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and access to evidence, circumventing the agreed document disclosure process, and ultimately usurping the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdition.11\n\nApplication, pp. 2, 3-4\n\nApplication, p. 2.\n\n12.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the raid on PT ICD was conducted \"without warning\" by four Indonesian police officers at around 1:30 pm local time on 29 August 2014; it ended at around 5:00 pm.12 Mr. Anton Hermawan, a \"high-ranking police officer from Police Headquarters in Jakarta\", led the raid. This same officer, say the Claimants, had already previously been investigating Mr. Paul Benjamin in connection with Indonesia\u2019s forgery allegations. The two employees of PT ICD present at the time, Mses. Paustina and Nurmalia, were presented with a \"warrant or court order\" to raid PT ICD and seize any documents. The police refused to provide a copy of the \"warrant or court order\" authorizing the search and seizure of documents on PT ICD\u2019s premises.\n\nApplication, p. 3. The Claimants\u2019 account of the police raid on PT ICD\u2019s offices in Jakarta relies on the account provided by Mr. Suharsanto Raharjo\u2019s of the law firm Hiswara Bunjamin & Tandjung in Jakarta, who attended PT ICD\u2019s offices in the immediate aftermath of the raid. *See* e-mail from Suharsanto Rahajaro to Russell Hardwick, dated 1 September 2014 (**Exh. C-376**).\n\n13.\n\nDuring the raid, say the Claimants, the police seized \"numerous documents and hard drives containing, *inter alia,* evidence relevant to this case\".13 According to the Claimants, the basic inventory of the seized files compiled by the Indonesian police \"does not provide an accurate description of the number and scope of documents confiscated\",14 thus precluding the Claimants from providing the Tribunal with a full list of the documents that have been seized. In any event, the Claimants insist that some of the documents are clearly relevant to the present case, and that some are even confidential or legally privileged.\n\nApplication, p. 2.\n\nApplication, p. 3, referring to the Minutes of Confiscation (**Exh. C-379**) and the Receipt (**Exh. C-380**).\n\n14.\n\nFor the Claimants, Indonesia is disingenuous when it argues that only \"certain documents\" had been seized, while the Indonesian police also seized computers and hard drives. While some documentation has since been returned to PT ICD, the computers and hard drives have not, which increases the uncertainty about the integrity of such equipment should it be returned.15\n\nReply, p. 4.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that while the raid was ostensibly conducted to seize documents in relation to the alleged forgery of mining licenses, the scope of the documents and data seized \"was far wider, including letters, receipts of delivery and acceptance, corporate documents, external hard disks, and other items\".16 No legal basis for \"such sweeping confiscation of documentation\" has been tendered to PT ICD or the Claimants.17\n\nApplication, p. 4.\n\n*Id.*\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants moreover argue that the Indonesian police did not advise PT ICD or the Claimants when they intended to return the remaining documents and equipment, if at all. To the contrary, the Indonesian authorities have informed PT ICD\u2019s staff that \"these items may never be returned\".18 Accordingly, the Claimants submit that they \"have lost access to substantial amounts of information in a manner that was abusive and unjustified\".19 The Respondent was wrong when it stated that there was no reason for concern about the Claimants\u2019 ability to utilize the documentation seized from PT ICD\u2019s office.20 In fact, the Claimants requested to be given access to essential computer equipment or to obtain mirror image copies of the hard drives and backup drives to finalize the translations requested by the Tribunal on 27 August 2014. Indonesia, however, replied that such a course of action was \"not possible\".21\n\nReply, p. 4.\n\nApplication, p. 5.\n\nReply, p. 4.\n\nReply, p. 4.\n\n17.\n\nMses. Paustina and Nurmalia were, say the Claimants, \"intimidated into silence by the suddenness and expansive scope of the raid\". They were also served with a summons to appear on 3 September 2014 before Mr. Hermawan for an interrogation in connection with the alleged forgery.22 These two employees form part of PT ICD\u2019s junior secretarial and accounting staff and have nothing to do with the forgery allegations, since they did not work for PT ICD at the relevant time.23\n\nApplication, p. 3.\n\nReply, p. 8.\n\n18.\n\nFor the Claimants, the police raid on PT ICD\u2019s premises is directly connected to the present proceedings since the raid was \"perfectly timed to coincide with the inspection so as to cause maximum surprise and disruption\".24 Several elements serve to prove the point. As noted in the Claimants\u2019 first application for provisional measures dated 27 March 2014, Indonesia acted within a matter of days after the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction when the Regent of East Kutai declared his intention to initiate criminal proceedings against the Claimants and their witnesses, and then initiated criminal proceedings against the Ridlatama companies two weeks later. Just as that action was a direct response to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction, the raid against PT ICD is a \"tactical move with a direct connection to developments in these ICSID proceedings\".25\n\nReply, p. 2.\n\nReply, p. 3.\n\n19.\n\nFurthermore, Indonesia has not undertaken any raid of the premises, offices or individual residences of any members of the Ridlatama group, which is the alleged focus of the police investigation. According to the Claimants, this further shows that Indonesia seeks to disrupt and circumvent the procedure set in the present proceedings and that it \"conducted the raid on PT ICD\u2019s premises in order to access the Claimants\u2019 documents outside the agreed document disclosure process in these ICSID proceedings\".26\n\nReply, p. 3.\n\n20.\n\nFor the Claimants, Indonesia is wrong to assert that the police raid on 29 August 2014 was a non-invasive act. For the Claimants, the police raid must be characterized as abusive, harassing or strong-arm tactics.27 Through the raid, the fear which the Claimants voiced in their first application for provisional measures have now materialized; its witnesses must and do fear police raids and abuse, property seizure and loss of their personal liberty, thus affecting their willingness or ability to give evidence in the present proceedings. The \"dismal record\" of Indonesian police officers with respect to due process rights of individuals under police investigation, as highlighted in two recent Amnesty International reports, confirms and exacerbates these fears.28\n\nReply, p. 3.\n\nReply, p. 4.\n\n21.\n\nIn reliance on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal is empowered to recommend the provisional measures they seek, in particular the preservation and protection of the rights which they assert in these proceedings, which run the risk of being destroyed or seriously prejudiced by the actions of the Respondent.29\n\nApplication, p. 5.\n\n22.\n\nWith reference to arbitral decisions, the Claimants submit that the requirements for provisional measures are that (i) the Claimants have rights requiring protection by this Tribunal, (ii) the requested measures are urgent, and (iii) necessary.30 They add that tribunals have also ascertained that the requested measures would not disproportionately burden the other party.\n\nApplication, p. 5.\n\n**a. Rights requiring protection**\n----------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Tribunal has \"wide discretion\" to recommend provisional measures. Provisional measures may serve to protect procedural as well as substantive rights.31 Pending the outcome of the arbitration, the rights that are subject to the arbitration must be protected if necessary by provisional measures. In the present case, the Claimants seek to protect their rights in the present proceedings, and, in particular, their right to access evidence and to present their case through witness testimony, which should not be impaired by (i) police raids on their premises, (ii) document seizures, and (iii) criminal investigations or the threat of such investigations brought against witnesses and potential witnesses.32\n\nApplication, p. 5.\n\nApplication, p. 5.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Indonesia\u2019s actions impair two types of self-standing rights:\n\n(i) the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute; and\n\n(ii) the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration.\n\n*i. The right to the preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants invoke a right to be free of criminal proceedings or threats of such proceedings and of any undue influence exerted by Indonesia on the Claimants\u2019 employees, witnesses and potential witnesses. For the Claimants, the raid on the premises of PT ICD, the arbitrary seizure of documents and other items, the summoning of PT ICD\u2019s employees for police interrogation, and the identification of Mr. Benjamin as a suspect in the ongoing criminal investigation, were \"all clearly designed to exert undue pressure\" on the Claimants and their witnesses.33\n\nApplication, pp. 5-6.\n\n26.\n\nThe timing of the raid also suggests that it was \"motivated by and aimed at the present arbitration\". Accordingly, Indonesia\u2019s actions are \"sufficiently related to the ICSID proceedings\" to warrant protection of the Claimants\u2019 rights to the preservation of the *status quo* and to the non-aggravation of the dispute.34\n\nApplication, p. 6.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants further point to their first application for provisional measures dated 27 March 2014, where they explained that various tribunals have recognized the right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute, in particular to avoid the \"continued harassment and intimidation\" such as the one faced by the Claimants, their witnesses and potential witnesses.35 In *Burlington*, the tribunal held these rights to be \"self-standing\" rights,36 and in *City Oriente,* the tribunal ordered Ecuador to stop pursuing administrative and criminal proceedings as a means to pressure the claimant.37\n\n*See* original Application dated 27 March 2014, \u00b6 40, referring to *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium v.

The right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nHere again, according to the Claimants, the timing of the police raid \"leaves no doubt that this was not a good faith exercise of sovereign powers\", but a deliberate move by Indonesia to gain a tactical advantage, designed to obstruct or derail the present proceedings. Through the raid, Indonesia effectively circumvented the agreed document production process \"and the Tribunal\u2019s control of that process\".38 Moreover, the document seizure, the summoning of PT ICD\u2019s employees, and the identification of Mr. Benjamin as a suspect \"pose an imminent threat to the Claimants\u2019 access to witnesses and documentary evidence\", thus encroaching on the Claimants\u2019 due process right to present their case.39 As of now, so the Claimants argue, the situation is clearly analogous to the one prevailing in *Quiborax.* As in that case, the timing of the raid was \"orchestrated by the same officials representing Indonesia in the arbitration to impair the Claimants\u2019 right to present their case\", with the result that the Claimants have now lost access to the documents seized during the raid, including privileged information.\n\nApplication, p. 6.\n\nApplication, p. 6.\n\n29.\n\nTo conclude, the Claimants argue that there is a \"clear and imminent threat to the procedural integrity of these ICSID proceedings\" and that the measures requested are intended to protect the Claimants\u2019 rights in this regard.40\n\nApplication, p. 7.\n\n**b. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the requirement of urgency is fulfilled, since there is a \"real risk that action prejudicial to the rights\" of the Claimants may be taken before the Tribunal could make its final determination.\n\n31.\n\nAs stated in *Quiborax,* measures seeking to protect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, to maintain the *status quo*, to prevent the aggravation of the dispute, and to protect the integrity of the arbitration are \"urgent by definition\".41\n\nApplication, p. 7, citing *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 151 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n32.\n\nIn the present case, the conduct of Indonesia has violated the rights for which the Claimants seek protection, namely the *status quo* has been affected, the dispute has been aggravated and there exists a clear and imminent threat to the procedural integrity of these proceedings. Accordingly, the urgency requirement is fulfilled.\n\n**c. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the requirement of necessity is met because Indonesia\u2019s actions are bound to cause harm that cannot be adequately repaired by an award on damages, in particular because the Claimants will not have access to evidence and witnesses in support of their case.42\n\nApplication, p. 7.\n\n34.\n\nIn this context, Indonesia\u2019s attempts to dismiss the anxiety now incurred by the Claimants\u2019 witnesses not only disregard the legal consequences attached to a criminal investigation. They also ignore Indonesia\u2019s own \"dismal record in affording due process to individuals under police investigation\", as recently highlighted in two reports by Amnesty International referring to excessive police violence and other human rights violations.43 It is therefore incorrect for the Respondent to state that the Claimants\u2019 witnesses need only fear the prospect of giving evidence, since they must and do fear police raids and abuse, property seizure and loss of personal liberty.\n\nReply, p. 4, referring to Amnesty International, \"Excessive Force: Impunity for Police Violence in Indonesia\", p. 2 (**Exh. C-371**); Amnesty International, \"Annual Report 2013: The state of the world\u2019s human rights\", p. 1 (**Exh. C-372**).\n\n**d. Proportionality**\n----------------------\n\n35.\n\nReferring to *Paushok*, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal is called upon \"to weigh the balance of inconvenience\" when recommending provisional measures. Doing so, the Tribunal should only refuse such recommendation if the requested measures \"impose too heavy a burden on the party against whom they are directed\".44 According to the Claimants, a deferral of the criminal investigation for another year until the Claimants\u2019 witnesses are heard at the hearing on the merits and an award is made would not disproportionately prejudice Indonesia. Indeed, the latter would only have to await the decision on the merits to commence the criminal investigations.45\n\nReply, p. 10, referring to *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. Government of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 79 (**Exh. CLA-186**).\n\nReply, p. 11.\n\n36.\n\nIn any event, a stay of the criminal investigation is of no prejudice in light of the 12 year statute of limitations applicable to document forgery under Indonesian law.46\n\n*Id.*\n\n**2. Position of the Respondent**\n---------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, none of the grounds mentioned in the Claimants\u2019 Application justifies a modification of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Procedural Order No. 9, which denied the Claimants\u2019 first request for provisional measures. For Indonesia, the Application is \"bereft of any proper evidence\" that could warrant the ordering of provisional measures.47 In fact, the Claimants\u2019 argumentation relies on allegations and submissions \"which are unsupported by the testimony of any witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the facts\".48 It remains that Indonesia has a \"valid interest\" in investigating the allegations of document forgery and vindicating the \"legitimate interests of the Republic\", while the Claimants remain unable to meet their \"heavy burden\" to show that Indonesia is acting in bad faith.49\n\nResponse, p. 1.\n\nRejoinder, p. 1.\n\nResponse, p. 2.\n\n38.\n\nMore specifically, according to the Respondent, none of the bases for the Application justifies the issuance of provisional measures. These bases are the following: (i) the police raid of PT ICD\u2019s premises on 29 August 2014, (ii) the issuance of a summons to two PT ICD employees to provide testimony, and (iii) the alleged classification of Mr. Benjamin as a \"formal suspect\".\n\n39.\n\nFirst, the Respondent advances that the police raid \"cannot, by itself, be characterized as abusive, harassing or 'strong-arm tactics'\". On-site searches, carried out on the basis of warrants without prior notice, are a common tool in any criminal legal system to gather potentially relevant evidence. Through their silence, the Claimants tacitly accepted as much. In any event, there is no evidence of any employee of PT ICD or witness in these proceedings complaining of any misconduct of the Indonesian authorities.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the search was conducted pursuant to a warrant and the minutes indicate that PT ICD would receive in return any irrelevant document.50 In fact, in response to a request of the Minister of Law and Human Rights, the police confirmed on 12 September 2014 that they would return any irrelevant documentation to PT ICD as appropriate. Hence, Indonesia submits that there is no reason for concern \"that Claimants will be unable to utilize in this Arbitration any of the documents taken from PT ICD's office during the search by the police on 29 August 2014\".51\n\nResponse, p. 2.\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\n41.\n\nAs to the scope of the documents and materials seized by the police, the Minutes of Confiscation and Receipt show that \"(i) the documents seized by the police were the Ridlatama Companies' documents (including those in various folders, based on their titles, notwithstanding that their exact content was unknown at that time), and (ii) external hard disk and CPU\".52 What is more, the Claimants do not allege that the seizure of those documents \"has deprived them of any evidence necessary for this Arbitration that is not available elsewhere\".53 Indeed, for Indonesia, the Claimants have been on notice for over a year of the envisaged criminal investigations. It is therefore \"hard to believe that Claimants have not copied long ago, and moved out of Indonesia, all documents of any conceivable relevance to this Arbitration\".54 In any event, the Claimants themselves acknowledge that some of the seized documentation has already been returned; they now only complain about the remaining computer equipment and hard drives.\n\nRejoinder, p. 4.\n\nRejoinder, p. 4.\n\nRejoinder, p. 4.\n\n42.\n\nAs to the timing, the Claimants are wrong to claim that the raid was orchestrated to coincide with the document inspection that took place in Singapore on the same day. Indeed, Indonesia insists that \"[b]oth counsel and the officials representing the Republic in this Arbitration first learned of the police action when Claimants served the Request on 2 September 2014\".55 Furthermore, the Claimants fail to explain how Indonesia would have benefitted from orchestrating such a raid.56 In any event, the Claimants\u2019 charge is meritless and \"defies logic\", since Indonesia was pressing since mid-May to organize a document inspection phase over the Claimants\u2019 \"vehement objections\". In reality, with the document inspection ordered by the Tribunal, Indonesia needed no additional evidence to demonstrate the forgery of the mining licenses. In sum, the police raid \"served no purpose or advantage to Respondent\u2019s position\", especially in light of the risk of having to face a renewed application for provisional measures from the Claimants.57\n\nResponse, p. 2; Rejoinder, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder, p. 3.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent further opposes the Claimants\u2019 argument that the absence of any raid at the Ridlatama offices shows that Indonesia seeks to circumvent the document disclosure phase in these proceedings.58 It is only logical that the premises of Ridlatama were not raided. Indeed, according to Mr. Benjamin\u2019s witness statement, \"all of the licenses secured by the Ridlatama Companies were stored at the PT ICD offices\".59 Furthermore, it may well be that Ridlatama officials pointed the police to the premises of PT ICD during one of the police interviews.\n\nRejoinder, p. 3.\n\nRejoinder, p. 3.\n\n44.\n\nComing now to the second basis of the Application, the Respondent observes that the summoning of PT ICD\u2019s employees to testify \"also is entirely proper\". Even the Tribunal itself foresaw this possibility in Procedural Order No. 9.60\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\n45.\n\nWith respect to the third basis of the Application, Indonesia asserts that Mr. Benjamin was not classified as a formal suspect. In this regard, the Claimants rely on a mistranslation of the word ***diduga*** found in the summons handed to Mses. Nurmalia and Paustina. According to Indonesia, the correct translation of the word ***diduga*** is \"assumed\", not \"suspected\" as argued by the Claimants. In Bahasa, the word ***tersangka***  means \"suspect\" and the word ***disangka*** means \"suspected\". This is further corroborated by the use of the word ***tersangka*** for the word \"suspect\" in the Indonesian Criminal Procedure Law.61\n\nResponse, p. 3, referring to Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 8 Year 1981, Chapter 1, Article 1 (**Exh. RLA-126**).\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent also stresses that the Claimants have failed to submit a witness statement of Mr. Benjamin evidencing \"a change in his status\", as required by law.62 Mr. Benjamin did not either indicate that he has been subjected to \"any instances of alleged pressure or intimidation\".63 In this regard, Indonesia submits that by choice or otherwise the \"Claimants have left the Tribunal without any evidence supporting their extreme, and irresponsible, charges\".64\n\nRejoinder, p. 5, pointing to Regulation of the Head of Police of the Republic of Indonesia No. 14 Year 1012 concerning Management of Criminal Offence Investigation, Articles 1, 70 (**Exh. RLA-168**).\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\n47.\n\nFinally, Indonesia reiterates that in light of his own testimony Mr. Benjamin\u2019s role is in any event crucial in the criminal investigation on the forgery allegations. Mr. Benjamin, \"more than anyone else at PT ICD, would have highly relevant information\" on how the alleged forgery occurred. Accordingly, Mr. Benjamin cannot be \"artificially cordoned off from the police investigation\".65 In any event, even if the Indonesian police ultimately classifies Mr. Benjamin as a formal suspect - which Indonesia insists has not happened - such a classification alone would not lead to criminal prosecution, which requires a review by a prosecutor. Hence, neither a change of status nor the initiation of criminal proceedings \"would necessarily be an automatic trip wire for action\".66\n\nRejoinder, p. 6.\n\nRejoinder, p. 6.\n\n48.\n\nTurning to the legal requirements for the recommendation of provisional measures, Indonesia submits that ICSID tribunals uniformly agree that the imposition of provisional measures \"is an extraordinary remedy that should not be granted lightly\".67 Where evidence is lacking to show that provisional measures are indeed urgent and necessary, provisional measures must be denied.\n\nRejoinder, p. 6, referring to *Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited v. Independent Power Tanzania Limited,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/8, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, 20 December 2009 (**Exh. RLA-139**); *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Procedural Order No. 10 on Security for Costs, 18 June 2012, pp. 2-3 (**Exh. RLA-151**).\n\n**a. Rights for which protection is requested**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*i. The right to the preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nFor the Respondent, the steps taken by its police, namely the seizure of potentially relevant evidence and the questioning of witnesses, \"are normal investigative techniques\" that do not alter the *status quo* or aggravate the dispute.68 While the Claimants complain that two of PT ICD\u2019s employees have been questioned for \"days on end\", they fail to point to a single instance of pressure, intimidation or threats directed towards them. The same applies to Mr. Benjamin, who - says the Respondent - is no longer a PT ICD employee and remains a simple witness in the criminal investigation. Nor can the Claimants make the case that the seizure of documents of the Ridlatama companies effectively alter the *status quo* or aggravate the dispute.\n\nRejoinder, p. 7.\n\n50.\n\nContrary to the Claimants\u2019 assertions, *Lao Holdings* does not assist their case, as Laos had agreed to refrain from pursuing ongoing criminal investigations. That tribunal denied Laos\u2019 request to reinstate those criminal investigations because such investigations would have been too disruptive shortly before the hearing date in the arbitration. These facts are not analogous to the present instance, since Indonesia \"has never consented to suspend or refrain from initiating a criminal investigation of the forged and fabricated Ridlatama mining undertaking licenses\".69 Here, the \"decision to delay criminal investigations was reversed only after Claimants\u2019 counsel affirmatively questioned the *bona fides* of the forgery allegations at the hearing in May 2013\".70\n\nRejoinder, p. 8.\n\nRejoinder, p. 8.\n\n*ii. The right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent underlines that the Claimants do not negate Indonesia\u2019s right to conduct a criminal investigation, as they did in their application of 27 March 2014. They now solely focus on the timing.71 However, neither the argument that the criminal investigation is disruptive and constitutes a diversion of the Claimants\u2019 resources, nor the argument that the criminal investigation deters the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and potential witnesses from giving evidence, have any merit.\n\nRejoinder, p. 9.\n\n52.\n\nFirst, according to the Respondent, the Claimants did not show any concern for cost when opposing the Respondent\u2019s request for document inspection or when filing a second application for provisional measures \"on the basis of plainly insufficient evidence\".72 And now again, the Claimants employ the same tactics to oppose the expedited resolution of the forgery issue.\n\nRejoinder, p. 9.\n\n53.\n\nSecond, regarding the alleged chilling effect of the criminal investigation on the willingness of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses, the Claimants\u2019 argument fails for lack of evidence of abuse, mistreatment or harassment. No witness has stated his or her unwillingness to testify in the present proceedings out of fear of prosecution.73\n\nRejoinder, p. 9.\n\n54.\n\nAs noted in *Quiborax,* arbitral tribunals cannot prohibit a State from conducting criminal proceedings, since these proceedings fall outside the scope of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction. It is \"a right and a responsibility of the State\" to conduct such proceedings.74\n\nRejoinder, pp. 9-10, citing *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 31 July 2009, \u00b6 137 (**Exh. RLA-133**); *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Procedural Order No. 13, 27 September 2012, \u00b6 39 (**Exh. RLA-169**); and referring to *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/02, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 129 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n55.\n\nOn this basis, Indonesia warns that the Tribunal \"must take care to avoid overstepping the bounds between the proper exercise of the jurisdiction it has asserted and the legitimate interests of the Indonesian authorities in enforcing the criminal laws of the land\".75\n\nRejoinder, p. 9.\n\n**b. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n56.\n\nFor the Respondent, the burden of showing that provisional measures are urgent falls on the requesting party \"and, where evidence is lacking, provisional measures must be denied\".76\n\nRejoinder, p. 7, further directing the Tribunal to the Respondent's prior submissions on the legal requirements for provisional measures, *see* Respondent's Response dated 25 April 2014, n. 62; Respondent's Rejoinder dated 27 May 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 24-63.\n\n**c. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n57.\n\nLike for the requirement of urgency, the Respondent submits that the burden of showing irreparable harm rests on the Claimants and that the latter failed to discharge their burden.77\n\nRejoinder, p. 7.\n\n58.\n\nTo sum up on the requirements of urgency and necessity, the Respondent contends that, in the absence of proof of actual threats or fears, the alleged breach of the procedural integrity of the arbitration or the alleged change of the *status quo* \"remain speculative and hypothetical\". There is thus no urgency or necessity to recommend any provisional measures.\n\n**d. Proportionality**\n----------------------\n\n59.\n\nAlthough the Claimants have not met their burden of showing urgency and necessity, they continue to argue that the requested measures would not disproportionately burden Indonesia. This is incorrect, since any third-party effort to delay the criminal investigation \"would be detrimental to its progress because it would sideline the existing investigative team, risk the loss of witnesses or documents and prolong an already long delayed inquiry, all making an ultimate prosecution more challenging\".78 Furthermore, it is unlikely that a stay of the criminal investigation for a year would change the position of witnesses testifying on behalf of the Claimants.\n\nRejoinder, p. 10.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n**1. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n60.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules empower the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures. Article 47 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n61.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in relevant parts the following:\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n[...]\n\n**2. Requirements for Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules requires a request to specify \"the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures\". ICSID tribunals have interpreted these requirements to mean that provisional measures must (i) serve to protect certain rights of the applicant, (ii) be urgent, and (iii) be necessary, which implies the existence of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm.79\n\n*See* *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38 (**Exh. CLA-172**); *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 51 (**Exh. CLA-173**); *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/02, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 113 (**Exh. CLA-170**); *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, 2 March 2011, \u00b6 12.\n\n63.\n\nWhile these requirements are undisputed, the Parties disagree on their fulfillment in the present circumstances. Specifically, they disagree on whether the rights for which protection is sought are affected (a. below) and whether the measures requested are urgent (b. below) and necessary (c. below).\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the applicant must establish the requirements with sufficient likelihood, without however having to actually prove the facts underlying them. It also notes that its assessment is necessarily made on the basis of the record as it presently stands. Hence, any findings and conclusions are without prejudice to a different assessment at a later stage.\n\n**a. Existence of Rights Requiring Preservation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants contend that (i) their right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute and (ii) their right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration, require protection by way of provisional measures.\n\n66.\n\nBefore addressing these contentions, the Tribunal recalls that in their first request for provisional measures, the Claimants alleged that the initiation of criminal proceedings against the Ridlatama companies (i) threatened the exclusivity of the proceedings, (ii) altered the *status quo* and aggravated the dispute, and (iii) impaired the procedural integrity of these proceedings. In light of the circumstances prevailing at the time, the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 9 denied the request, *inter alia*, on the grounds that the record showed no undue pressure or intimidation against the Claimants or their witnesses and that the alleged impairment of the Claimants\u2019 procedural rights remained speculative and hypothetical. The Tribunal noted, however, that its finding could be revised if the circumstances were to change.\n\n*i. The right to the preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the circumstances have clearly changed since the issuance of Procedural Order No. 9 and that there is now a \"clear and imminent threat\" to the *status quo*.80 According to them, the ongoing criminal investigation \"strikes directly at the Claimants and the people and issues involved in this arbitration\".81 More specifically, the Claimants recall that Indonesia\u2019s lead counsel made \"explicit threats\" of criminal investigation against the Claimants, their witnesses and employees, as well as \"a clear and direct threat\" against Mr. Benjamin.82 While in Procedural Order No. 9 the Tribunal held that there was no element on record evidencing any pressure or intimidation, that situation has changed in light of (i) the raid on PT ICD's premises, (ii) the seizure of documents and computer hard drives, (iii) the intimidation of two of PT ICD's employees *inter alia* through questioning by police \"for days on end\", and (iv) the fact that Mr. Benjamin has been labeled a \"suspect\".\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter to the Tribunal, 26 September 2014, p. 1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter to the Tribunal, 26 September 2014, p. 7.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n68.\n\nFor the Claimants, these acts are \"intimidatory and abusive behaviour\" that crosses the line into \"forbidden territory of using the process of the criminal law to obtain an unfair advantage\" in this arbitration, which also aggravates \"the inequality of arms between the parties\".83 In sum, these recent actions are part of a \"campaign of intimidation, harassment, and undue pressure and influence\" against the Claimants and their witnesses.84\n\n*Id.*, p. 8.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n69.\n\nIndonesia responds that no change of circumstances warrants a modification of Procedural Order No. 9. The record does not support the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the *status quo* has been altered or that the dispute has been aggravated. The police raid, the seizure of documents and the interrogation of witnesses are \"normal criminal investigative techniques\" common to all legal systems around the world. Without more, they cannot be labeled as abusive or harassing.85 In any event, the Claimants have not argued that the raid was conducted in breach of Indonesian law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal, 15 September 2014, p. 2; Respondent's letter to the Tribunal, 6 October 2014, p. 7.\n\n70.\n\nIndonesia further submits that the Claimants fail to cite any instance of pressure, intimidation or threats aimed at the two employees of PT ICD or any other employee. They also fail to mention any mistreatment of Mr. Benjamin, who is a witness in the ongoing investigation and not a suspect as the Claimants now allege. Furthermore, the seizure of the documents of the Ridlatama companies has caused no adverse impact to the Claimants.\n\n71.\n\nIt is well settled that provisional measures may be recommended to protect the rights to the *status quo* and to the non-aggravation of the dispute, which are self-standing rights vested in any party to ICSID proceedings.\n\n72.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal stresses that the right, even the duty, to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions is a prerogative of any sovereign State. By way of consequence, ICSID tribunals have rightly held that when it comes to criminal proceedings \"a particularly high threshold must be overcome\" before an ICSID tribunal can recommend provisional measures.86 An allegation that the *status quo* has been altered or that the dispute has been aggravated needs to be buttressed by concrete instances of intimidation or harassment. On the basis of the record as it presently stands, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have not met the burden of establishing conduct of this nature.\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, 31 July 2009, \u00b6 137 (**Exh. RLA-****133**).\n\n73.\n\nFirst, the Claimants conceded at the hearing that the raid was conducted in accordance with Indonesian law. It is indeed common practice in criminal law systems to conduct on-site searches and to seize relevant evidence for the purpose of a criminal investigation during these searches. Obviously, procedural safeguards must be respected. In this latter regard, the Claimants admit that PT ICD\u2019s employees were shown a warrant prior to the search, received Minutes of Confiscation and Receipt listing the documents seized,87 and were served a summons to appear for questioning by the police.88 There is no indication that these procedures were irregular. There is no showing either of malfeasance or other abusive behavior on the part of the Indonesian authorities in this context.\n\nMinutes of Confiscation (**Exh. C-379**); Receipt (**Exh. C-380**).\n\nSummon Letter (Ms. Nurmalia) of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Police of the Republic of Indonesia, No.: S.Pgl/2111/IX/2014/Dit Tipidum, 1 September 2014 (**Exh. C-377**); Summon Letter (Ms. Maria Anna Paustina) of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Police of the Republic of Indonesia, No.: S.Pgl/2112/IX/2014/Dit Tipidum, 1 September 2014 (**Exh. C-378**).\n\n74.\n\nSecond, the Claimants state that documentation and computer material seized was not returned to PT ICD. The Claimants also note that they made \"several requests\" to the Indonesian police to have essential computer equipment returned (albeit in order to progress on the document translations requested by the Tribunal until 27 August 2014). Yet, the Tribunal observes that there is no evidence of such requests to the police (nor of any refusals for that matter). In this connection, the Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s commitment that \"PT ICD will be given the opportunity to review and take copies of any relevant documents that are not returned\",89 which the Tribunal understands to extend to the seized computer equipment and hard drives.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal, 15 September 2014, pp. 2-3.\n\n75.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants\u2019 right to present their case, it has not been shown that the Claimants have been deprived of relevant evidence. This is particularly so considering the Respondent\u2019s commitment referred to above. Obviously, this assessment could change if that commitment is not kept within reasonable time, and access to relevant evidence is effectively barred.\n\n76.\n\nThird, there is no indication either that Mses. Nurmalia and Paustina have been intimidated and harassed by the Indonesian police during the police raid at PT ICD\u2019s premises on 29 August 2014 or during the police interrogation that took place on 3 September 2014. The fact that Mses. Nurmalia and Paustina are junior secretarial staff does not shield them from a legitimate police investigation, even if they were not employed at the time when the disputed documents were allegedly forged. Hence, in the absence of other factors, the fact that Mses. Nurmalia and Paustina were summoned to a police interrogation does not appear objectionable. While it is true that any police raid may negatively impress those who are subject to it, that does not in and of itself mean that improper methods were used.\n\n77.\n\nFinally, regarding Mr. Benjamin, no concrete element of intimidation or harassment has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal that could warrant provisional measures. While fears and concerns deriving from an ongoing criminal investigation may be understandable, it is not sufficient to allege, without more, that the possibility of being the target of a criminal investigation is intimidatory to obtain protection through provisional measures.\n\n78.\n\nAnother argument turns on the alleged change of status of Mr. Benjamin from a \"witness\" to a \"suspect\". The Tribunal need not enter into the semantic discussion on the word ***diduga*** contained in Article 1(14) of Indonesia\u2019s Criminal Procedure Law.90 It only notes, on the one hand, that the Claimants concede that Mr. Benjamin has not been served with a notice of a change of status and, on the other, that Indonesia has explicitly represented that Mr. Benjamin is a witness and not a suspect. Accordingly, the Tribunal sees no change of circumstances with respect to Mr. Benjamin.\n\nIndonesian Code of Criminal Procedure, Act No. 8/1981 (**Exh. CLA-189**); Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 8 Year 1981 (**Exh. RLA-126 updated**).\n\n79.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal stresses that even if Mr. Benjamin were a suspect in the criminal investigation, this would not justify provisional measures in and of itself, failing a showing of intimidation, harassment or malfeasance. In this sense, the situation here must be distinguished from the one in *Quiborax*, where one of the witnesses was effectively neutralized through the local criminal proceedings and thus prevented from testifying in the arbitration.91\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 144 (**Exh. CLA-170**).\n\n80.\n\nFinally, the Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Lao Holdings N. V.* is of little assistance in the present circumstances.92 In contrast to the present case, the Lao government sought leave by the tribunal to resume a criminal investigation that it had previously voluntarily stayed. The tribunal held that a resumption of the criminal investigation several weeks before the evidentiary hearing would be disruptive and that the proposed course of action amounted to a \"change of tactics\" designed to obtain an advantage in the arbitration.93\n\n*Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People*\u2019 *s Democratic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order, 30 May 2014 (**Exh. CLA-196**).\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 49.\n\n81.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants\u2019 argument that Indonesia may obtain an unfair advantage in the present proceedings by gathering evidence through investigative techniques applicable under its criminal procedure law, thus circumventing the document production procedure available to the Parties in this arbitration. While it takes note of Indonesia\u2019s statement that it has all the evidence necessary on the forgery and does not need to obtain additional proof by way of the criminal investigation, the Tribunal is also aware that Indonesia is currently in possession of documentation and hard drives obtained through the raid of 29 August 2014. It can thus not rule out that Indonesia may seek to file evidence into the record obtained through the criminal investigation.\n\n82.\n\nAccording to Rule 39(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal may recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in the Application. To avoid that the risk mentioned above materializes, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent should seek leave from the Tribunal before introducing evidence which it has obtained or will obtain through the criminal investigation conducted on the allegation of forgery. This recommendation is meant to avoid any unfair advantage and level the playing field between the Parties. It will in particular allow the Tribunal to hear any objection the Claimant may have with respect to the evidence at issue. Moreover, if the Tribunal admits the evidence, it will assess its evidentiary value taking all the circumstances into account, including its source. Similarly, the Tribunal takes due notice of the Respondent\u2019s commitment set out in paragraph 74 above. If the Claimants were to be refused copies of any documents covered by this commitment that may contain relevant evidence in support of the Claimants\u2019 case, they may apply for directions from the Tribunal.\n\n*ii. The right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nFor the Claimants, Indonesia\u2019s conduct poses an immediate threat to the procedural integrity of these proceedings, in particular in light of the direct connection between Indonesia\u2019s conduct and developments in these proceedings and the timing of Indonesia\u2019s conduct. The ongoing criminal investigation is not only disruptive and diverts resources, it also works as a \"powerful deterrent to the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and potential witnesses to give evidence contrary to Indonesia\u2019s position\".94 The factual scenario is now \"highly analogous\" to the one in *Quiborax.* Moreover, Indonesia\u2019s conduct places an \"intolerable pressure\" on the Claimants and their witnesses and potential witnesses, since the Claimants still have a presence in Indonesia through PT ICD, and the targets of the criminal investigation, in particular Mr. Benjamin and other employees of PT ICD, are residing in Indonesia together with their families.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter to the Tribunal, 26 September 2014, p. 9.\n\n84.\n\nFor the Respondent, none of the Claimants\u2019 arguments have any merit. The Claimants\u2019 concern for costs is contradicted by the efforts they expended to oppose the document inspection, to make a second application for provisional measures, or to oppose the swift resolution of the forgery issue. Furthermore, the Claimants provided no statements of current witnesses demonstrating that they refused to testify out of fear of prosecution. In any event, ICSID arbitration does not confer \"automatic immunity\" from criminal proceedings, which fall outside of the jurisdiction of ICSID and this Tribunal.\n\n85.\n\nIt is common ground that the right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration proceedings may find protection by way of provisional measures. The Parties disagree, however, on the existence of a threat to such integrity created by the Respondent\u2019s conduct in connection with the police raid. On the one hand, the Claimants contend that the timing of the raid shows the direct link with the developments in the present proceedings. On the other hand, the Respondent insists and \"unequivocally confirms\" that neither the Respondent\u2019s counsel nor Government officials representing the Respondent in these proceedings knew of the police raid until the Claimants filed their Application on 2 September 2014. The Respondent further denies that the Minister of Law and Human Rights in any way orchestrated the police raid or the timing of that action.\n\n86.\n\nWhile it is true that the timing of the raid is remarkable, the Tribunal fails to discern an element allowing it to connect the raid to the latest developments in these proceedings. There is certainly an inherent element of disruption with police raids, as they are usually conducted without prior notice. This being so, the Claimants do not allege that the police raid was conducted in breach of Indonesian law. Beyond that, the Tribunal takes note of Indonesia\u2019s representation that neither counsel nor Government officials representing Indonesia in this arbitration were aware of the police raid when it took place. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s statement that it already has the necessary evidence to substantiate its forgery allegations in the present proceedings. As a result, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the police raid of 29 August 2014 threatens the procedural integrity of this arbitration.\n\n87.\n\nNor does the Tribunal believe that that particular raid or the subsequent interrogation of Mses. Nurmalia and Paustina amounted to abusive behavior able to exert such a chilling effect on the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and potential witnesses so as to prevent them from testifying against the Respondent in the present proceedings. Again, without any concrete element of intimidation, harassment or otherwise abusive behavior, and failing evidence from any potential witnesses, the present situation does not suffice to justify provisional measures. In this sense, *Quiborax* must be distinguished to the extent that it involved a concrete case of intimidation of one of the claimants\u2019 witnesses that had been silenced and prevented from testifying in favor of the claimants in the arbitration. There is no trace of such abusive behavior in the present case.\n\n**b. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n88.\n\nWhile the Parties agree on the requirement of urgency, they have divergent views as to whether it is met here. The urgency requirement is met by definition where a procedural right worthy of protection is impaired or imminently risks to be impaired.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal held above that (i) the police raid, (ii) the seizure of documents and other materials, (iii) the summoning and interrogation of Mses. Nurmalia and Paustina, and (iv) the mention of Mr. Benjamin on the summons were insufficient in the circumstances to jeopardize the rights for which the Claimants seek protection by way of provisional measures. Hence, the urgency requirement cannot be deemed fulfilled on these counts.\n\n90.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal is of the view that the urgency requirement is fulfilled regarding the risk that Indonesia may gain an unfair advantage in the present proceedings by using evidence obtained in the criminal investigation without seeking prior leave by the Tribunal (see above paragraphs 81-82).\n\n**c. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n91.\n\nFor the same reasons as stated above, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no risk of irreparable harm that cannot be made good through an award on damages, except if the Respondent were allowed to put in the record evidence gathered through its criminal investigation without first seeking leave by the Tribunal as specified in paragraph 82 above.\n\n**d. Final Observations**\n-------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal again stresses the Parties\u2019 general duty, which arises from the principle of good faith, not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration.\n\n93.\n\nFinally, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to award it the costs associated with the Claimants\u2019 Application, including its legal and administrative fees and expenses, as well as those of the Tribunal.95 Considering that it was not unreasonable under the circumstances to file the Application and in line with the practice adopted in earlier decisions and orders, the Tribunal will reserve the issue of costs for a later determination.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal, 6 October 2014, p. 11.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n94.\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal issues the following decision:\n\n(1) Denies the Claimants\u2019 Application, as amended, for provisional measures;\n\n(2) Orders the Respondent to request leave from the Tribunal before filing any evidence obtained by way of the criminal investigation into the alleged forgery issue;\n\n(3) Takes due note of the Respondent\u2019s commitment set out in paragraph 74 above;\n\n(4) Reminds the Parties of their general duty arising from the principle of good faith not to take any action that may aggravate the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration;\n\n(5) Costs are reserved for a later decision or award."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-12-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| AIM | Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange |\n| Application for Dismissal | Respondent's Application for Dismissal of Claimants' Claims based on the Forged and Fabricated Ridlatama Mining Licenses dated 24 September 2014 and filed on 25 September 2014 |\n| BEM | Bara Energi Makmur |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty, specifically, without further designation, the United Kingdom-Indonesia BIT (\"UK-Indonesia BIT\") and the Australia-Indonesia BIT |\n| BPK | Financial Auditor Body (*Badan* *Pemeriksa Keuangan*) |\n| Churchill | Churchill Mining Plc |\n| Claimants | Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd |\n| C-Answers | Claimants' Answers to the State's Comments on Document Inspection and Other Documents Obtained through Document Production of 3 July 2015 |\n| C-Comments | Claimants' Comments on the Second Document Inspection of 12 June 2015 |\n| C-Comments on Minnotte | Claimants' Submissions on *Minnotte v.* *Poland* dated 23 September 23 |\n| C-Reply on Minnotte | Claimants' Reply Submissions on *Minnotte v.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe procedural history leading up to the Tribunal's Decisions on Jurisdiction of 24 February 2014 is set out in full in those Decisions, which are made part of the present Award.1 However, prior to summarizing the procedural history relevant to the document authenticity phase, the Tribunal will recall the main procedural steps of the earlier phase of this arbitration. Abbreviations used in the Tribunal's Decisions on Jurisdiction are equally deemed repeated and incorporated into the present Award, to the extent not explicitly set out.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40 between Churchill Mining Plc and the Republic of Indonesia (\"Churchill Decision on Jurisdiction\"), \u00b6\u00b6 4876; Decision on Jurisdiction in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40 between Planet Mining Pty Ltd and the Republic of Indonesia (\"Planet Decision on Jurisdiction\"), \u00b6\u00b6 4876.\n\n2.\n\nAs recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction between Churchill Mining Plc (\"Churchill\") and the Republic of Indonesia (\"Indonesia\"),2 the dispute in this case was initially submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 27 April 1976 (the \"UK-Indonesia BIT\", the \"Treaty\", or the \"BIT\"), which entered into force on 24 March 1977, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). As recalled below, another ICSID proceeding was subsequently initiated on the basis of the ICSID Convention and the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 17 November 1992 (the \"Australia-Indonesia BIT\", the \"Treaty\", or the \"BIT\").3\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48 and note 84.\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48.\n\n3.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, Churchill filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the UK-Indonesia BIT. The request concerned a dispute between Churchill and Indonesia arising out of Churchill's alleged investment in Indonesian companies in the coal mining industry. In the request, Churchill invoked Articles 3(2) and 5(1) of the UK-Indonesia BIT. According to Churchill, Indonesia had taken measures against its investment in violation of these provisions of the BIT.\n\n4.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Churchill's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention under ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14. An Arbitral Tribunal comprised of Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (President), Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg, and Mr. Michael Hwang S.C. was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and the proceedings commenced on 3 October 2012.\n\n5.\n\nOn 26 November 2012, Planet Mining Pty Ltd (\"Planet\") filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the Australia-Indonesia BIT. This request, which concerned a dispute between Planet and Indonesia arising out of Planet's alleged investment in Indonesian companies in the coal mining industry, was expressly made in connection with that filed by Churchill against Indonesia on 22 May 2012. As noted in the Decisions on Jurisdiction, the facts upon which both requests are based are essentially the same.4\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48.\n\n6.\n\nOn 26 December 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Planet's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention under ICSID No. ARB/12/40. On 22 January 2013, pursuant to the Parties' agreement, an Arbitral Tribunal also comprised of Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (President), Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg, and Mr. Michael Hwang S.C. was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and the proceedings commenced on that date.\n\n7.\n\nHaving agreed in principle that the two disputes would be heard in a consolidated case, Churchill, Planet, and Indonesia agreed at a common session on 1 March 2013 to join the two proceedings in all respects, but disagreed as to whether the Tribunal should render one joint decision/award in respect of both Churchill and Planet or two separate decisions/awards, one in respect of each claimant.5 In Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the content of the common session and noted that it would decide whether to render one or two decisions/awards at a later stage, after consultation with the Parties.6\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 58; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59.\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\n8.\n\nIn paragraph 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by the Tribunal's letter of 21 February 2013, and recorded in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal set a schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the case.7\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 61; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 62. With regard to the modalities of the consolidated proceedings, the Tribunal decided in Procedural Order No. 4 that the procedural calendar under Annex 3 to Procedural Order No. 1, amended by letter of 21 February 2013 and supplemented by letter of 1 March 2013, would govern; that the Tribunal's orders issued as of the date of the common session would apply to all three Parties, with the exception of Procedural Order No. 3 dealing with Indonesia's request for provisional measures in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14; and that the Centre would maintain only one case account, the case number being ICSID No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40.\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties having filed their written submissions on jurisdiction, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Singapore on 13-14 May 2013.8\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 61-70; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 62-70.\n\n10.\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Tribunal issued two Decisions on Jurisdiction, one in respect of Churchill and Indonesia and the other in respect of Planet and Indonesia. In both Decisions, the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration and reserved its decision on costs.9\n\nChurchill Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 319; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 298.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 7 March 2014, the Parties were invited by the Tribunal to confer and make their best efforts to agree on a schedule for the merits phase of this arbitration and to revert to the Tribunal by 24 March 2014.\n\n12.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were unable to agree on a schedule for the merits phase and each made a proposal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 27 March 2014, the Claimants filed an Application for Provisional Measures, alleging that \"Indonesia is seeking to usurp the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and destabilise the Claimants' witnesses and potential witnesses by the threat of criminal sanction\".10 Following an exchange of correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal,11 the Respondent was invited to submit its Response to the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures by 25 April 2014.\n\nClaimants' Application for Provisional Measures dated 27 March 2014, \u00b6 1.\n\n*See* letters from the Tribunal dated 2 and 11 April 2014; letter from the Respondent dated 7 April 2014; and letter from the Claimants dated 10 April 2014.\n\n14.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 8 of 22 April 2014, the Tribunal decided not to bifurcate the proceedings between liability and quantum, as proposed by the Respondent, and established a calendar for the merits phase of the arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 April 2014, the Respondent filed its Response to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n16.\n\nOn 12 May 2014, the Claimants submitted their Reply to Indonesia's Response to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n17.\n\nOn 16 May 2014, the Respondent filed a Request for Inspection of Claimants' Original Documents, along with a List of Disputed Documents and Mr. Gideon Epstein's Forensic Handwriting Examination Report dated 9 May 2014.\n\n18.\n\nOn 19 May 2014, following an exchange of correspondence with the Parties,12 the Tribunal issued an amended schedule for the merits phase of the proceeding.\n\n*See* letters from the Claimants dated 2 and 14 May 2014; letters from the Respondent dated 8 and 15 May 2014.\n\n19.\n\nOn 27 May 2014, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures dated 27 May 2014.\n\n20.\n\nOn 28 May 2014, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent's Request for Inspection of Original Documents dated 16 May 2014. On 6 June 2014, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimants' letter of 28 May 2014, to which the Claimants responded on 20 June 2014. The Claimants stated *inter alia* that, if the Tribunal were inclined to order the inspection of any of the original documents identified by the Respondent, the Tribunal should also order the Respondent to produce for inspection the originals identified by the Claimants in its response.\n\n21.\n\nOn 18 June 2014, following an exchange of correspondence with the Parties,13 the Tribunal issued a further amended schedule for the merits phase of this proceeding.

Pre-hearing phase**\n------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 29 August 2014, a document inspection took place at Maxwell Chambers, Singapore, under the supervision of ICSID.20\n\nOn the same date, the Secretariat circulated to the Parties and the Tribunal an electronic copy of the documents that were submitted by the Parties for inspection.\n\n29.\n\nOn 2 September 2014, the Claimants filed an Application for Provisional Measures, alleging that the Respondent had \"sought to destabilise the Claimants' witnesses and access to evidence, circumvent the agreed document disclosure process, and ultimately usurp the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\".21\n\nClaimants' letter of 2 September 2014, p. 2.\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 September 2014, the Respondent submitted its Observations to Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures dated 2 September 2014, together with the Second Forensic Handwriting Examination Report of Mr. Gideon Epstein dated 15 September 2014.\n\n31.\n\nOn 15 September 2014, in response to the Tribunal's ruling of 27 August 2014, the Claimants filed translations of certain exhibits and requested that they be allowed to submit the remaining translations by 26 September 2014 owing to a police raid on PT Indonesian Coal Development's (\"PT ICD\") premises on 29 August 2014.\n\n32.\n\nOn 25 September 2014, Indonesia filed an Application for Dismissal of Claimants' Claims Based on the Forged and Fabricated Ridlatama Mining Licenses (the \"Application for Dismissal\"), appending witness statements of Messrs. Ishak, Noor, Ordiansyah, Armin, Ramadani, Sianipar, and Ms. Nurohmah, as well as the preliminary expert reports of Econ One Research and Bara Consulting.22 Indonesia requested that the Tribunal (i) modify the procedural calendar to organize an immediate hearing (within three weeks) to address the authenticity of the disputed documents, and ultimately (ii) dismiss all of the Claimants' claims as inadmissible.\n\nThe Application for Dismissal is dated 24 September 2014.\n\n33.\n\nOn 26 September 2014, the Claimants provided their comments on the Application for Dismissal, opposing the request for an immediate hearing. On the same date, the Claimants also submitted the remaining translations of their exhibits and their Reply to Indonesia's Observations of 15 September 2014 regarding the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures dated 2 September 2014 (\"Claimants' Reply on Provisional Measures\").\n\n34.\n\nOn 30 September 2014, the Respondent suggested that it would be helpful for the Tribunal to receive the Claimants' comments on the Respondent's proposal of 15 September that the Claimants disclose the conclusions of their forensic experts following the August document inspection. On 3 October 2014, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's \"request for information on the work that has been performed by the Claimants' forensic experts to date\", and indicated it would present its expert evidence in accordance with the procedural calendar, with its case on the merits.23\n\nLetter from the Claimants dated 3 October 2014, p. 1.\n\n35.\n\nOn 6 October 2014, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder to the Claimants' Reply on Provisional Measures of 26 September 2014.\n\n36.\n\nOn 9 October 2014, Indonesia provided further comments on its Application for Dismissal, reiterating its prior requests.\n\n37.\n\nOn 13 October 2014, the Respondent submitted Mr. Gideon Epstein's Third Forensic Handwriting Examination Report.\n\n38.\n\nOn 15 October 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to reiterate its concern that the Claimants would be unlikely to be able to pay any adverse award on costs if the Ridlatama mining undertaking licenses and other documentation were found to have been forged and fabricated.24\n\n*See* also Application for Dismissal, \u00b6 7.\n\n39.\n\nOn 17 October 2014, the Claimants submitted further comments on the Respondent's letter of 9 October 2014 in connection with the Application for Dismissal.\n\n40.\n\nOn 21 October 2014, the Tribunal held a hearing by telephone conference on the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures and the procedural treatment of the Respondent's forgery allegations.\n\n41.\n\nOn 27 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (\"PO12\"), rejecting Indonesia's request for the immediate adjudication of the forgery issue. However, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings between a liability and a quantum phase, with the then-existing timetable applying to the liability phase.\n\n42.\n\nFollowing a request for reconsideration filed by Indonesia on 3 November 2014 and the Claimants' comments thereon of 10 November 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (\"PO13\") on 18 November 2014, which granted Indonesia's request for reconsideration, and decided to address the authenticity of the disputed documents as a matter of priority. The Tribunal determined that the scope of the authenticity phase would extend to \"all factual aspects relating to forgery as well as the legal consequences of a finding of forgery\". PO13 added that this was not meant to prevent the Parties from addressing other matters which they might deem appropriate in connection with the forgery allegations and arguments. The Tribunal also ruled that the decision in PO12 regarding bifurcation between liability and quantum would remain in abeyance, and would be considered if and when appropriate.\n\n43.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14, which rejected the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures. However, in light of the possibility of obtaining evidence through the Indonesian criminal investigation, the Tribunal ordered Indonesia to request leave before filing any evidence obtained by way of the criminal investigation into the alleged forgery issue.\n\n44.\n\nFollowing a request for reconsideration of PO13 filed by the Claimants on 23 November 2014 and the Parties' comments thereon of 1, 8, and 12 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (\"PO15\") on 12 January 2015, which reaffirmed PO13. The Tribunal set out a new procedural calendar and contemplated a new document inspection. It also specified the scope of the document authenticity phase as being limited to (i) the factual question whether the impugned documents were authentic or not (including especially who signed the documents and how) and (ii) legal submissions on the positions in law in a scenario where there would be forgery (including for instance the legal requirements for estoppel, as opposed to the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel).25\n\nProcedural Order No. 15, \u00b6 34.\n\n45.\n\nFollowing correspondence from the Parties of 19 and 26 January 2015, the Tribunal proposed hearing dates, amended the deadlines for document production and denied the Respondent's request to be afforded additional time to rebut the Claimants' witness statements and expert reports prior to the hearing.26\n\n*See* letter from the Tribunal dated 29 January 2015.\n\n46.\n\nBy letter of 3 February 2015, Clifford Chance informed the Tribunal that they had been appointed as the Claimants' legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, replacing the Claimants' previous legal counsel, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.27 By email of the same date, the Claimants requested an extension of the deadline to file the Parties' document production requests, and informed the Tribunal of their unavailability on the proposed hearing dates. By letter of the same date, the Respondent objected to the requested extension and reserved its right to request an order for security for costs in light of what it perceived as a sign of further deterioration of Churchill's finances. By letter of 4 February 2015, the Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter of 3 February. By letter of 6 February 2015, the Tribunal granted the requested extension of the deadline to file the Parties' document production requests and proposed new hearing dates.\n\n*See* Powers of attorney dated 2 February 2015. By letter of 5 February 2015, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP informed the Centre that \"the record should be amended to reflect that Claimants' counsel of record in these proceedings is now Clifford Chance\".\n\n47.\n\nBy email of 13 February 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement to conduct a second document inspection the week of 13 April 2015.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter of 4 March 2015, the Tribunal confirmed the schedule for the document authenticity phase of this arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter of 11 March 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit new evidence - Recommendation No. 522.21/5213/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of Forestry, dated 29 December 2009, regarding Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (the \"Recommendation\") - and advised the Tribunal that it would file additional and supplementary witness statements and an additional report from Mr. Epstein \"in relation to two other sets of suspicious documents on the record\".28\n\nLetter from the Respondent dated 11 March 2015, p. 4.\n\n50.\n\nOn 13 March 2015, the Parties exchanged their requests for document production and physical inspection of original documents. On the same date, pursuant to Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants filed an application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads, which they requested should be made available for inspection and sampling at the document inspection.\n\n51.\n\nOn 18 March 2015, the Claimants filed their comments on the Respondent's letter of 11 March 2015. By letter of 20 March 2015, the Tribunal ruled *inter alia* on the Respondent's 11 March request, granting the Respondent leave to file the additional materials subject to certain conditions.\n\n52.\n\nOn 27 March 2015, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimants' application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads and on certain specific observations made in their letter of 18 March 2015.\n\n53.\n\nHaving exchanged their responses to each other's requests for document production and physical inspection of original documents on 24 March 2015, each Party submitted their replies on 30 and 31 March 2015.29\n\n*See* the Parties' agreement on the amended schedule for document production recorded in the Claimants' email of 20 March 2015 and confirmed in the Tribunal's letter of the same date. *See* also the Respondent's email of 22 March 2015; Tribunal's email of 26 March 2015.\n\n54.\n\nOn 3 April 2015, further to its letter of 11 March 2015 and subsequent correspondence,30 the Respondent submitted the Recommendation, additional and supplementary witness statements,31 and other supporting documents. The Respondent also reiterated its concern (in light of an interim report from Churchill) that it would not be able to recover a potential award of costs and again reserved its rights to request security for costs. On the same date, the Respondent submitted further comments on the Claimants' application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads.\n\nClaimants' letter dated 18 March 2015; Tribunal's letter dated 20 March 2015, \u00b6 1; Respondent's email of 23 March 2015 recording the Parties' agreement.\n\nThe Respondent submitted:  \n 1) the Second Witness Statement of Mr. H.

Luluk Nurohmah dated 31 March 2015;  \n 3) the Witness Statement of Mr. Bambang Setiawan dated 31 March 2015; and  \n 4) the Witness Statement of Mr. Chaerul Anwar Djalil dated 31 March 2015.\n\n55.\n\nOn 6 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 (\"PO16\"), which addressed the Parties' document inspection and document production requests. By letter of 15 April 2015, the Parties were also advised of further rules that would apply to the document inspection.\n\n56.\n\nOn 8 April 2015, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent's letters of 27 March and 3 April 2015 regarding the Claimants' application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads. The Claimants invited the Respondent to \"unequivocally\" confirm that it no longer had in its possession, custody or control any stamps and ink pads used by the Regency of East Kutai or the Governor of East Kalimantan between 1 January 2007 and 30 June 2010. They also accepted the Respondent's offer to inspect current stamps and ink pads used by the Regency and Governor's office since 2010. Upon the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent submitted on 10 April 2015 its comments on certain matters raised by the Claimants in their letter of 8 April. In view of the Respondent's confirmation that it no longer has any stamps and ink pads used during the relevant period, the Tribunal considered that the issue whether such stamps and ink pads should be inspected had become moot.\n\n57.\n\nFurther to a request from the Claimants seeking an extension of the deadline to produce documents as ordered by the Tribunal, and subsequent correspondence between the Parties,32 the Tribunal confirmed on 13 April 2015 the extension to 20 April of the time limit for document production (other than documents for the inspection scheduled on 16-17 April), it being specified that the Tribunal might allow the production of specific documents until 27 April upon a reasoned request explaining why a given document could not be produced within the extended time limit of 20 April.33\n\nClaimants' emails of 10 and 11 April 2015; Respondent's emails of 10 and 13 April 2015.\n\nThe Tribunal added that such request should only be filed if the Parties were unable to agree on production after 20 April. If so, the request should be filed as soon as possible and in any event prior to 20 April.\n\n58.\n\nOn 16-17 April 2015, a second document inspection took place in Maxwell Chambers, Singapore, under the supervision of ICSID.34\n\nAt the document inspection, the Claimants indicated *, inter alia*, that it would not conduct an inspection of the stamps the Respondent brought to the document inspection and noted that the stamps of the relevant period were unavailable.\n\n59.\n\nOn 21 April 2015, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimants to enter into a confidentiality agreement covering the \"Third Party Documents\", i.e. certain mining undertaking license and borrow-for-use permit applications and other documents that, in the Respondent's view, contain commercial information of third parties, on the terms proposed by the Respondent or such other terms and conditions as the Tribunal deems appropriate (\"Respondent's Request for a Confidentiality Order\").35 The Respondent also requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to abide by the terms of the Respondent's proposed confidentiality agreement pending the Tribunal's decision on its other request.\n\nThe Respondent's request was dated 20 April 2015.\n\n60.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent also asked the Tribunal to reconsider its order in PO16 requiring production of certain documents requested by the Claimants or, in the alternative, not to draw any adverse inference against the Respondent for failure to produce the requested documents (\"Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of Certain Production Orders\").36\n\nThe Respondent's letter was dated 20 April 2015.\n\n61.\n\nOn 24 April 2015, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent's Request for a Confidentiality Order and Request for Reconsideration of Certain Production Orders.\n\n62.\n\nOn 27 April 2015, the Respondent filed Mr. Gideon Epstein's Fourth Forensic Handwriting Examination Report regarding the materials mentioned in Respondent's 11 March 2015 Application to file the Recommendation.\n\n63.\n\nOn 28 April 2015, the Respondent responded to the Claimants' comments of 24 April regarding the Respondent's Request for a Confidentiality Order.\n\n64.\n\nOn 30 April 2015, the Respondent responded to the Claimants' comments of 24 April on the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of Certain Production Orders.37 The Claimants submitted a response to the Respondent's letter of 30 April on 5 May 2015.\n\nThe Respondent also commented on a letter from the Claimants dated 29 April 2015 regarding the production of documents ordered by the Tribunal in PO16.\n\n65.\n\nBy email of 4 May 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached an agreement with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement proposed by the Respondent in connection with Third Party Documents produced by the Respondent in the case.

On 22 June 2015, in response to these comments, the Respondent reiterated its request of 16 June and maintained its reservation of rights to supplement the record. On 24 June 2015, the Tribunal ruled on the Respondent's request of 16 June, and allowed the Claimants to file an additional expert report on the impugned documents by 1 July 2015 and the Respondent to comment (without expert report) on such report by 15 July 2015, it being understood that the Parties would then address these matters further in oral arguments and in testimony at the hearing.\n\n73.\n\nOn 1 July 2015, the Claimants filed the Third Report of Dr. Steven J.

Having heard the Parties on the Claimants' application of 30 July 2015,49 the Tribunal informed the Parties at the hearing of its decision to disregard Mr. Noor's witness statement in accordance with paragraph 16.9 of the Procedural Order No 1 and, by analogy, Article 4.7 of the IBA Rules.50\n\n*See* Tr. (Day 1), 8-12; (Day 2), 1-8.\n\n*See* Tr. (Day 2), 8-9.\n\n85.\n\nThe hearing was recorded and transcribed in real time.\n\n**D. Post-hearing phase**\n-------------------------\n\n86.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 (\"PO20\") on 20 August 2015 dealing with post-hearing matters, setting time limits for the submission of (i) corrections to the hearing transcript, (ii) two rounds of posthearing briefs, and (iii) costs submissions. In addition, the Tribunal put various questions to the Parties to be addressed in the post-hearing briefs. The Tribunal confirmed that the scope of the post-hearing briefs extended to \"(i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or not and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery\". It further specified that \"[m]atter (i) includes the question whether, if they were not handwritten, the impugned signatures were affixed with authority\" and that \"[m]atter (ii) about the legal position in the event of forgery does not cover the effect of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses on the exploitation licenses\".\n\n87.\n\nOn 24 September 2015, the Parties jointly filed corrected versions of the transcripts. On 2 October 2015, they filed further joint corrections to the transcripts.\n\n88.\n\nOn 20 October 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their first Post-Hearing Briefs, and on 17 November 2015, their Reply Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n89.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their Costs Submissions and on 23 December 2015 their comments on the other Parties' Costs Submissions.\n\n90.\n\nOn 28 March 2016, following a request of 11 February 2016 by the Centre addressed to both Parties for a fifth advance payment, and the receipt of the Claimants' share as confirmed by the Centre's letter of 9 March 2016, the Centre notified the Respondent's default to the Parties and invited either Party to pay the outstanding amount by 12 April 2016. On 13 April 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that the Claimants had paid the fifth advance payment in full.\n\n91.\n\nBy letter of 13 April 2016, the Claimants alleged that the Respondent's failure to pay its share of the fifth advance was in violation of the ICSID Convention, the Administrative and Financial Regulations, Procedural Order No. 1, and the UK-Indonesia and Australia-Indonesia BITs and reserved their rights as to these violations. The Claimants further invited the Tribunal to infer from the Respondent's behavior that it had deliberately failed to pay; sought leave to amend their Costs Submissions to take into account the impact of the Respondent's default on the fifth advance; put the Respondent on notice that if it \"brings any further application in this arbitration, the Claimants will ask the Tribunal to direct that the State pay the entirety of any advance payment requested by ICSID in respect of such application\"; and invited the Respondent \"to provide unequivocal confirmation that it is still participating in these proceedings\". Finally, the Claimants stated that if no confirmation was provided by 20 April, the Claimants would put the Respondent on notice that the Claimants \"will bring an application under Rule 42 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\" and \"ask the Tribunal to fix a schedule for the completion of this case without the participation of the State\".\n\n92.\n\nOn that same date, the Tribunal granted leave to the Claimants to amend and update their Costs Submissions by 20 April 2016, which they did. In addition, the Claimants filed an Application under Rule 42, requesting the Tribunal to notify the Respondent of the Claimants' Application; continue to proceed to render a \"fully-reasoned decision\" on the Respondent's Application for Dismissal; order the Respondent to provide a written explanation for its default on the fifth advance payment; failing which, grant leave to file a request for \"programming orders\"; and make any further appropriate orders.51\n\nClaimants' Application under Rule 42, \u00b6 8.\n\n93.\n\nBy letter of 25 April 2016, the Tribunal indicated that the Respondent had been given notice of the Claimants' Application, confirmed that it was deliberating and working on its ruling on the Respondent's Application for Dismissal, and invited the Respondent to provide an explanation for its failure to pay its share of the fifth advance payment as well as to make any comments it might have on the Claimants' Application by 9 May 2016.\n\n94.\n\nOn 4 May 2016, the Centre confirmed receipt of the payment of the Respondent's share of the fifth advance, and indicated that it would refund to the Claimants the amount they had paid on behalf of the Respondent. In addition, the Centre conveyed the Tribunal's understanding that, in light of the Respondent's payment of its share, the Claimants' Application under Rule 42 (as well as the invitation made to the Respondent to respond to this Application by 9 May 2016) had become moot.\n\n95.\n\nBy email of 6 May 2016, the Claimants expressed their concern as to the Tribunal's understanding that their Application had become moot, since the Respondent still had not provided any explanation for failing to pay its fifth advance on time and the Claimants had incurred \"considerable costs as a consequence of the State's default\". Accordingly, the Claimants requested that the Respondent provide an explanation for its default and confirm that it intended to continue to participate in this arbitration. The Claimants also requested that the Tribunal make an order that, in any event and regardless of the payment of the fifth advance, the Respondent pay the costs incurred by the Claimants as a consequence of the Respondent's default.\n\n96.\n\nOn 18 May 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit by 30 May 2016 any comments it may have had on the Claimants' Application under Rule 42. The Claimants were also invited to update within the same time limit their costs submissions to the extent that additional costs were incurred since their amended costs submissions of 20 April 2016.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent filed its comments on 30 May 2016 and the Claimants filed their updated costs submissions on the same day.52\n\nOn 1 December 2016, the Tribunal drew the Parties' attention to the discrepancy between the total amount of the advance payments made by each Party as recorded by ICSID (USD 800,000) and as reflected in the Parties' costs submissions (USD 600,000). Noting that this discrepancy was most likely due to the timing of the cost submissions and of the last advance payments, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would understand the costs submissions to refer to a total amount of USD 800,000 per Party, unless advised otherwise by 5 December 2016. On 2 December 2016, the Respondent confirmed that its advance payments to ICSID amounted to USD 800,000. The Claimants did not advise the Tribunal of any different amount by the deadline set by the Tribunal. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal recalls that the Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the following payments from the Parties:  \n 1. USD 100,000 from the Claimants on 18 October 2012;  \n 2. USD 100,000 from the Respondent on 6 November 2012;  \n 3. USD 150,000 from the Claimants on 2 May 2013;  \n 4. USD 150,000 from the Respondent on 2 May 2013;  \n 5. USD 200,000 from the Claimants on 31 March 2014;  \n 6. USD 200,000 from the Respondent on 7 April 2014;  \n 7. USD 150,000 from the Claimants on 7 July 2015;  \n 8. USD 150,000 from the Respondent on 25 August 2015;  \n 9. USD 200,000 from the Claimants on 9 March 2016; and  \n 10. USD 200,000 from the Respondent on 4 May 2016.  \n The letters acknowledging receipt of the Parties' advance payments were attached to the Tribunal's letter of 1 December 2016 for the Parties' convenience.\n\n98.\n\nOn 9 September 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on *Minnotte v. Poland*,53 a decision dealing with the consequence of third party fraud, an issue which it considered potentially relevant to its decision. The Tribunal further invited the Parties to state whether they would consent to the issuance of one decision or award.\n\n*David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v. Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/10/1, Award, 16 May 2014 (**Exh. CLA-255**).\n\n99.\n\nOn 23 September 2016, while the Claimants filed their first submission on *Minnotte* with the Secretariat, the Respondent requested a one-week extension to file its comments. On 24 September 2016, after having heard the Claimants' position, the Tribunal extended the time limit for the first submission on *Minnotte* until 27 September 2016 and for the Parties' second submission until 11 October 2016. The Parties filed their submissions on these dates54 and gave their consent to the issuance of one decision/award. The proceeding was closed on 6 December 2016.\n\nEach Party's first submission on *Minnotte* was transmitted to the other Party and the Tribunal on 27 September 2016, once both submissions had been received by the Secretariat.\n\n**II. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nIn the Application for Dismissal, which is the subject matter of this Award, the Respondent has requested the issuance of an award:\n\n(i) deciding that the Ridlatama Companies' mining undertaking licenses for general survey and exploration upgrades were forged,\n\n(ii) deciding that the other impugned documents were forged,\n\n(iii) dismissing all of the claims asserted by Claimants, and\n\n(iv) ordering Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with this arbitration.55\n\nRespondent's Application for Dismissal of Claimants' Claims Based on the Forged and Fabricated Ridlatama Mining Licenses, 24 September 2014, \u00b6 47; R-PHB1, \u00b6 147.\n\n101.\n\nIn its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) \"find that the Ridlatama Companies' mining undertaking licenses for general survey and exploration are not authentic;\n\n(b) find that the other impugned documents are not authentic;\n\n(c) issue an award dismissing all of the claims asserted by Claimants;\n\n(d) order Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by Respondent in connection with this Arbitration; and\n\n(e) order such other relief as it deems appropriate\".56\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 50.\n\n**B. Claimants' Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants have asked the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) dismiss the Respondent's Application, and\n\n(ii) order the Respondent to pay the Claimants' legal costs of responding to its Application in full.57\n\nClaimants' Reply to the State's Application for Dismissal of the Claimants' Claims Based on Forged and Fabricated Ridlatama Mining Licenses, \u00b6 260.\n\n103.\n\nThese requests have remained unchanged.\n\n**III. THE FACTS**\n------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe relevant facts are discussed in detail in the course of this Award. In addition, the Tribunal refers back to the facts set out in the Decisions on Jurisdiction, which are incorporated here by reference.\n\n**IV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThis section is meant to provide an overview of the Parties' positions, which are elaborated upon if and when useful in the context of the Tribunal's analysis (Section IV).\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nIndonesia requests that the Tribunal dismiss all of the Claimants' claims on the ground that the mining undertaking licenses and related approvals allegedly constituting the basis of the Claimants' investment in the EKCP \"were forged and fabricated\".58 In addition, Indonesia submits that the upgrading of these non-existent licenses to exploitation mining licenses was secured through \"deception and fraud\".59 For Indonesia, since the Claimants rely on the validity of the mining licenses held by Ridlatama, a finding that such licenses are invalid because they were forged would undermine the Claimants' entire case.\n\nRespondent's Application for Dismissal of Claimants' Claims Based on the Forged and Fabricated Ridlatama Mining Licenses, 24 September 2014, \u00b6 1.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 3.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal will first briefly summarize Indonesia's position on the facts and the evidence (1) and then continue with its main legal arguments (2).\n\n**1.

C-146**) ; Exploitation Business License for Ridlatama Mineral, Decision No. 188.4.45/118/HK/III/2009, 27 March 2009 (**Exh.

C-149**).\n\n110.\n\nIndonesia contends that the authenticity of other documents is \"questionable\", such as the 2007 Staff Analysis prepared by Mr. Putra, which reached the conclusion that Nusantara's licenses had lapsed and that the blocks were available.67\n\nStaff Analysis by Mining & Energy Bureau, Regency of East Kutai, 26 February 2007 (**Exh. C-34**).\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the disputed documents bear two sets of identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (as Regent and as Governor); one set of identical signatures of Mr. Noor; and one set of identical signatures of Mr. Bambang Setiawan. In addition, the signature of Mr. Ishak on the Gunter Documents was copied and pasted from the PT RP Survey License.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent notes that documents nos. 1 to 18 in the Document Table bear the identical signature of Mr. Ishak in his capacity as Regent of East Kutai68 and that documents nos. 19 to 24 in the Document Table bear the identical signature of Mr. Ishak in his capacity as Governor of East Kalimantan.\n\nThe Respondent indicates that the 8 Mining Licenses contain 39 forged signatures, all of which were generated by the same master signature. Tr. (Day 1), 28:17-19 (Opening, O'Donoghue).\n\n**1.1. Method employed to forge the documents**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nFor Indonesia, the signatures in documents nos. 1-32 in the Document Table were produced \"by a piece of very sophisticated technology, most probably an autopen device\".69 Indonesia's expert, Mr. Epstein, confirmed in his reports and at the hearing that Messrs. Ishak, Noor and Setiawan did not sign the disputed documents and that their signatures had been affixed with a so-called \"autopen\".70 An autopen uses a master signature that is programed through a smart card or flash drive so as to produce identical signatures in ink.71\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 4.\n\nApplication for Dismissal, \u00b6 23; Tr. (Day 1), 28:20 (Opening, O'Donoghue); Epstein ER1, pp. 6-7; Epstein ER2, p. 8.\n\nApplication for Dismissal, note 27; Epstein ER2, p. 8.\n\n114.\n\nIndonesia notes that the Claimants admit that the disputed documents were not signed by hand and that identical signatures were reproduced within certain sets of documents.72 It notes that the Claimants' expert, Dr. Strach, accepted that autopen technology could be an explanation, although he was more inclined to admit that a high quality stamping or printing technology produced the signatures, he was unable to identify any technology that could achieve such high quality stamp impressions.73 In contrast to Mr. Epstein, who has extensive experience with autopen technology, consulted with senior personnel of the Autopen Company, and acknowledged that the signatures might have been produced by a different technology, Indonesia emphasizes that Dr. Strach has close to no experience with autopen technology and only inferred from some dots and fine marks on the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses (documents nos. 1 and 2 in the Document Table) that all other signatures could not have been produced by autopen technology. Mr. Epstein, so states Indonesia, explained that the dots and fine marks were more likely the cause of a malfunction of the autopen.74 In any event, Indonesia emphasizes that both experts \"agree that the reproduced signatures were of a very high quality, which could not be achieved by typical stamps\".75\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 2; R-PHB1, \u00b6 3.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 23.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 26.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 28:23-25 (Opening, O'Donoghue).\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent further observes that the two Gunter Documents (documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table) contain identical signatures of Mr. Ishak from the PT RP license of 12 February 2007.76 Both experts confirmed that the signatures were affixed on the second version of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses by using a \"relatively unsophisticated \u2018copy and paste' method\".77 This leads Indonesia to conclude that this \"leaves little doubt that someone associated with Ridlatama, or someone who had access to that unique license, had a hand in the forgery\".78\n\nTr.

(Day 1), 29:15-17 (Opening, O'Donoghue).\n\n116.\n\nFor Indonesia, the fact that the disputed documents were not signed by hand is \"very strong evidence\" that forgery occurred, notably because both the Respondent's and the Claimants' witnesses testified at the hearing that mining licenses are signed by hand only.79 Mr. Gunter, a witness presented by the Claimants, confirmed that the signature was the \"last bastion of power\", further stating that using digital signatures would be \"dangerous\", and concluding that \"[i]t should have been all original signatures\".80 Similarly, Mr. Benjamin, another of the Claimants' witnesses, confessed that he was not aware that the disputed signatures were not handwritten and that he would have been concerned if he had known this to be the case.81\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 13. For the Respondent's witnesses, *see* : Ishak WS1, \u00b6 10; Setiawan WS, \u00b6 9; Tr. (Day 5), 74:20-75:7 (Tribunal, Setiawan); Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 37; Ramadani WS, \u00b6 17; Tr.

Elements of forgery identified by Indonesia\u2019s experts and witnesses**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nIndonesia points to the following irregularities on the disputed documents that support its claim that they were forged or fabricated.\n\na) Survey Licenses\n------------------\n\n120.\n\nAs a general matter, Indonesia relies on Mr. Epstein's expertise to argue that Mr. Ishak's signature on all disputed Survey Licenses was not handwritten, but the product of autopen technology. In addition, Mr. Epstein found that a master signature was used to produce documents 1 to 18 in the Document Table. Finally, Indonesia submits that the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses (document nos, 1 and 2 in the Document Table) contain special features not otherwise present on documents 3 to 18 in the Document Table. More specifically, Indonesia points to the following irregularities with respect to each specific license.\n\n(i) PT RTM Survey License\n-------------------------\n\n121.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the protuberances, angular features, voids, width variations, small spots and dots, smudge marks and faint marks are the result of a malfunction of the autopen device.86 In fact, the Claimants and Dr. Strach fail to explain why these features reoccur in the same position, whereas the marks associated with the stamp impressions vary.87 Furthermore, the maps appear to have been produced by a \"trickster\",88 since they contain the following defects:89 (i) the inset in the legend showing the message \"I Lover You\" and \"Oh yes/no\",90 (ii) the map lacks Mr. Ordiansyah's initials, (iii) latitudinal and longitudinal numbers are only on two sides instead of all four sides, in addition to being in the incorrect numerical order,91 and (iv) the legend does not define \"HP\" (*hutan produksi* or production forest).\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 44-47.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 48.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 63.\n\n*See* table R-Answers, p. 32.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 72, and p. 30, Image 3.\n\nR-Answers, p. 28, Image 2.\n\n122.\n\nAdditional anomalies highlighted by Indonesia include: the draft decree was issued on the same date as the license;92 the map attached to the draft decree was not issued by the Planology Office (no longitudinal and latitudinal graticules;93 Mr. Putra's instead of Mr. Ordiansyah's initials) and differs from the map in the license;94 the license and draft decree are based on a 20 March 2007 application, but the records only contain a 23 February 2007 application;95 the area in the application is different from the area granted in the license;96 and Mr. Kurniawan's list contains no application dated 20 March 2007.97\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 65.\n\nThe longitudinal and latitudinal graticules form the grid of a coordinate system, such as in maps.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 77.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 79. Compare Exh. C-32 with Exh.

Armin, Ramadani and Ordiansyah confirmed. Mr. Armin testified that the archives of the Mining and Energy Bureau contain no originals or copies of the disputed license.99 Messrs. Ordiansyah and Ramadani further confirmed that the Planology Office did not issue the map, and that the map is not in the standard format for 2007 maps, and was never registered in the SIG database.100\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. *See* also: Tr.

SIG stands for *Sistem Informasi Geografis* or Geographic Information System.\n\n(ii) PT RTP Survey License\n--------------------------\n\n124.\n\nIndonesia raises the same concerns about the PT RTP license as for the PT RTM license, save for the following: (i) the map depicts a white area in the south of the PT RTP block, although it is actually in a production forest;101 and (ii) the map was designed by a certain Chand, and Mr. Gunter conceded that it was generated by GMT.102\n\nR-Answers, p. 32, table.\n\nR-Answers, p. 33, Image 4.\n\n(iii) PT INP Survey License\n---------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIndonesia observes that the PT INP license (i) is not registered in the Regency's registration book;103 (ii) the document number belongs to a document issued in June 2007;104 (iii) the map attached was generated by an entity called \"ADH\";105 (iv) the map does not bear the initials of Mr. Ordiansyah;106 (v) the map only has graticules on two sides instead of four; (vi) the map shows no forestry area; (v) the map's inset covers all of East Kalimantan when it should only cover the Regency of East Kutai; (vii) the map is not properly oriented; (viii) the map was taken from PT INP's application;107 and (ix) the map legend contains a word in English.108\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 81.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 81 ; Ramadani WS, Annex (**Exh.

More specifically, the Respondent raises the following concerns:\n\n(i) PT RTP Exploration License\n------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe decree number does not comply with the official format for 2008 decrees, since it should be located in the middle, not at the beginning of the document number, as other entries in the 2008 registration book show.110 In addition, the document number belongs to a different document.111 Finally, the \"Having in Mind\" section contains various irregularities, such as multiple references to the same regulations, wrong names and years of regulations.112\n\nRamadani WS, Annex, items 5-16.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 82; Ramadani WS, Annex, items 5-16.\n\nRamadani WS, Annex, item 13.\n\n129.\n\nWith respect to the attached maps, they bear none of the characteristics of official Regency maps, since (i) there are three maps instead of one; (ii) they were compiled by \"ADH\" on 11 June 2007 and are copyrighted; (iii) they show no forestry area; (iv) the legends are in English instead of Bahasa; (iv) they do not contain Mr. Ordiansyah's initials; (v) the Regent's signature is outside the maps instead of inside the legend column; (vi) the graticules are only on two instead of four sides; (vii) the maps are not properly oriented; (viii) they contain insets whereas official maps of 2008 do not have such insets; and (ix) the maps are scaled 1:50,000 instead of 1:250,000.113\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 88 and pp. 44-48; Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 26; Ramadani WS, Annex, item 13.\n\n(ii) PT RTM Exploration License\n-------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIndonesia makes the same comments on the PT RTM Exploration License as those for the PT RTP Exploration License. In addition, it notes that the decree number is the same as the one used for the April 2008 legality explanation letter for PT RTM (document no. 12 in the Document Table).\n\n(iii) PT INP Exploration License\n--------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent makes the same contentions about the PT INP license as for the PT RTP and PT RTM licenses. With respect to the maps, it points out that (i) there are two maps instead of one; (ii) the situation map is identical to the one attached to PT INP's application for general survey; and (iii) the maps were compiled on 22 February 2008.\n\n(iv) PT IR Exploration License\n------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nIndonesia puts forward the same concerns for the PT IR license as for the PT RTP, PT RTM and PT INP licenses. With respect to the maps, Indonesia states that the situation map is identical to the map attached to PT IR's application for general survey.\n\nc) Payment Requests\n-------------------\n\n133.\n\nIndonesia essentially claims that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were not freely handwritten on the payment letters (documents nos. 5-6 in the Document Table) and that they were produced using an autopen.114 Mr. Epstein confirmed that the signature of Mr. Ishak stems from the same model as the one in documents 1 to 18 in the Document Table.\n\nEpstein ER4.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent also emphasizes that Mr. Ishak gave evidence that he never issued requests for payment of dead rents or seriousness bonds.115\n\nIshak WS2, \u00b6 11.\n\nd) Cooperation and Legality Letters\n-----------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nIndonesia submits that Mr. Ishak did not sign the Cooperation and Legality Letters (documents nos. 7-14 in the Document Table) by hand and that the signature was produced by an autopen. It also insists that Mr. Ishak testified that he had no knowledge of PT ICD or the Claimants at the time, and that he was unaware of their cooperation with Ridlatama.116 Mr. Armin confirmed that the Regency never issued Legality Letters, and that the Regency's archives contain no original or copy of these letters.117 In addition, the Respondent notes the following anomalies on these letters: (i) the decree numbers are the same as the corresponding numbers of the disputed Exploration Licenses; (ii) the decree numbers are not in the format of official 2008 decrees, since they should be placed in the middle and not at the beginning.118\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 20.\n\nArmin WS, \u00b6 26.\n\nRamadani WS, Annex.\n\ne) Borrow-for-Use Recommendations\n---------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the two sets of Borrow-for-Use Recommendations are forged (documents nos. 19-24 in the Document Table). Indonesia points to the fact that the 29 December 2009 and 11 March 2010 letters are essentially identical as to their content, that Mr. Ishak's signatures are identical and were produced using an autopen, and that Mr. Ishak testified that he did not sign or authorize these documents.119 In this context, Mr. Epstein clarified that Mr. Ishak's signature is a different master signature than the one used for documents nos. 1 to 18 in the Document Table and that this second master signature was used to produce his signatures on documents nos. 19 to 24 in the Document Table.\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 15; Epstein ER2.\n\nf) Technical Considerations\n---------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent further challenges the authenticity of four Technical Considerations of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (\"MEMR\") dated 22 September 2010 (documents nos. 29-32 in the Document Table). It relies on the following evidence to substantiate its position. The Respondent's expert, Mr. Epstein, confirmed that Mr. Setiawan's signature was affixed using an autopen.120 He further testified that Mr. Setiawan's signatures on all the disputed technical consideration letters are identical and were produced with the same master signature. Mr. Setiawan also gave evidence that he did not recall signing these letters, but that he signed all letters by hand.121 Similarly, Mr. Djalil confirmed that Mr. Setiawan always signed his letters by hand and that the MEMR does not use autopen devices. Both Mr. Setiawan and Mr. Djalil further pointed to various oddities in the Technical Considerations confirming that they were forged, such as the use of an incorrect NIP, incorrect initials and an incorrect stamp.\n\nEpstein ER3.\n\nSetiawan WS, \u00b6 9.\n\ng) Re-Enactment Decrees\n-----------------------\n\n138.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Re-Enactment Decrees dated 14 May 2010 were also forged (documents nos. 25-28 in the Document Table). Indonesia contends that, in contrast to the revocation decrees dated 4 May 2010 containing Mr. Noor's handwritten signature (the \"Revocation Decrees\"),122 the signature of Mr. Noor on the Re-Enactment Decrees was not freely handwritten and was produced with an autopen. Mr. Epstein confirmed that Mr. Noor's signature was identical on all disputed documents, since a master signature was employed. Mr. Epstein indicated that the small dot appearing below the signature is \"probably an ink spot on the master\".123 Mr. Noor indicated in his witness statement that he did not sign or authorize these documents,124 and that he always signs official documents by hand.125\n\nDecree of the Regent of East Kutai No. 540.1/K.443/HK/V/2010, concerning Revocation of Decree of the Regent of East Kutai No. 188.4.45/118/HK/III/2009, concerning Mining Undertaking License (IUP) for Exploitation to PT RTM, 4 May 2010 (**Exh.

R-064**) ; Decree of the Regent of East Kutai No. 540.1/K.441/HK/V/2010, concerning Revocation of Decree of the Regent of East Kutai No. 188.4.45/116/HK/III/2009, concerning Mining Undertaking License (IUP) for Exploitation to PT RTM, 4 May 2010 (**Exh. R-065**).\n\nEpstein ER2, \u00b6 3.\n\nNoor WS, \u00b6 19.\n\nNoor WS, \u00b6 21.\n\n**1.3. The use of Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature was not authorized**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nIt is the Respondent's submission that, since it is undisputed that the signatures on the impugned documents were not signed by hand but applied mechanically, the question boils down to whether these mechanical signatures were authorized or not. For Indonesia, the evidence establishes that Mr. Ishak did not authorize the placement of his signature on the disputed documents (documents nos. 1 to 18 in the Document Table).126 When Mr. Ishak was away, Mr. Noor would sign for him, but in his capacity as Deputy Regent, not with Mr. Ishak's name.127 According to Indonesia, the following elements corroborate this conclusion.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 29; Ishak WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Ishak WS2, \u00b6 10; Tr. (Day 3), 35:14-15 (Tribunal, Ishak).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 29, n. 55. Tr. (Day 3), 84:2-8 (Cross, Ishak).\n\na) Numerous irregularities in the Licenses\n------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn addition to the testimony of Mr. Ishak stating that he did not sign or authorize the Survey and Exploration Licenses, Indonesia points to a series of \"glaring indicia\" corroborating its case: (i) the insets on the maps attached to the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses contain the inscriptions \"I Lover You\" and \"Oh Yes/no\" in addition to other \"nonsensical\" words in Indonesian such as \"Del. Guablik Benga\" and \"Nganyuk\"; (ii) the maps of the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses were copied and pasted from the applications and their legends are in English; (iii) the Exploration Licenses contain three copyrighted maps compiled by ADH and the maps are in portrait instead of landscape format; and (iv) none of the maps contain latitudinal and longitudinal numbers on all four sides.128\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 177.\n\nb) Application process\n----------------------\n\n141.\n\nMessrs. Ordiansyah and Armin gave evidence that they did not process the PT RTM and PT RTP general survey applications, so insists Indonesia, since they overlapped with Nusantara Wahau Coal (\"NWC\") and Kaltim Nusantara Coal (\"KNC\") Exploration Licenses.129\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 30; Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 26; Armin WS, \u00b6 21; Tr. (Day 3), 144:4-14 (Direct, Ordiansyah); Tr. (Day 4), 131:12-132:5 (Tribunal, Armin).\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent also emphasizes that the spatial analyses contained in the Gunter Documents (documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table) show that NWC and KNC held valid exploration licenses, as indicated by the abbreviation \" *Eks.* \", which means *eksplorasi* and not \"Ex\" (i.e. former) as suggested by the Claimants.130\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 30.\n\n143.\n\nFurther, according to the Respondent, the 26 February 2007 Staff Analysis is unreliable and does not support the contention that the areas applied for by PT RTM and PT RTP were open and available. Most importantly, it refers to the MEMR letter of 23 March 2007 which postdates the staff analysis, suggesting that it was backdated. Mr. Ishak denied ever seeing it, it does not contain any *disposisi* (orders/directions), and it is inconsistent with Mr. Putra's staff analysis of 19 May 2008 where Nusantara's application was deemed timely.131\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 32.\n\n144.\n\nAs for the 23 March 2007 MEMR letter, so adds the Respondent, it only states that the concession areas would become open if Nusantara's concessions had expired and no extension had been requested, but it does not say that the areas were open, a point conceded by Mr. Quinlivan at the hearing.132\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 33; Tr. (Day 6), 53:3-13 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\n145.\n\nWith respect to the draft decrees (Exh. C-383 and Exh. C-384), Indonesia questions their authenticity for various reasons: (i) it is unclear how Mr. Kurniawan obtained these documents; (ii) since they were issued on the same date as the original decrees, it is unclear why Mr. Wirmantono obtained these draft decrees if the purpose was to reassure him that the process was progressing well; (iii) Mr. Armin testified that he did not prepare the draft decrees, and Mr. Ordiansyah testified that the maps were not issued or approved by the Planology Office; and (iv) Mr. Benjamin had no knowledge of the draft decrees.133 Ultimately, the draft decrees do not prove that Mr. Ishak authorized his signature to be placed on the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, since it was within Mr. Ishak's discretion to sign or not, as Mr. Quinlivan acknowledged.134 Mr. Ishak actually explained that he checked whether Nusantara still had valid licenses, and \"that is why perhaps I did not sign the letter, because there was something there at the time that had not been fulfilled, and I think - I'm certain it was that\".135\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 34.\n\nTr. (Day 6), 56:17-20 (Cross, Quinlivan): (\"If Ridlatama applied for them, the discretion to appoint them was the Regent's\").\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 35; Tr. (Day 3), 15:25-16:21 (Direct, Ishak).\n\nc) Maps attached to the Mining Licenses\n---------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, maps issued by the Planology Office contain handwritten signatures of the Regent. None of the maps attached to the disputed licenses were signed by the Regent, as they contain the same identical signature as on the other disputed documents. Other elements prove that the maps were not issued by the Planology Office: (i) the PT RTP Survey License map was designed by someone called \"Chand\"; (ii) the PT INP and PT IR Survey License maps were copied and pasted from the applications; (iii) Mr. Gunter confirmed that the Exploration License maps were compiled by GMT and should not have been part of the official licenses; (iv) the PT RTM and PT RTP map insets \"I Lover You\" and \"Oh Yes/no\" are nonsensical;136 (v) the PT INP and PT IR maps are upside down; (vi) the PT INP and PT IR Survey License maps contain English text; and (vii) the Exploration Licenses contain three types of maps prepared by GMT instead of one map prepared by the Planology Office. In addition, these peculiarities are unique to Ridlatama licenses and appear nowhere else.137\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 3.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 39.\n\nd) Documents not registered\n---------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIt is the Respondent's further submission that, save for the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, none of the disputed documents issued by the Regency was properly registered, in addition to bearing decree numbers assigned to other unrelated decrees.138 With regard to the registration of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, Mr. Ramadani testified that Mr. Putra instructed the registrar to register them, promising her to provide the originals, which he never did.139 In the end, so writes the Respondent, \"[r]egistration of fictitious or falsified documents does not make them authentic\",140 but demonstrates \"the extent and reach of the scheme\".141\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 40.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 43; Tr. (Day 5), 36:10-21 (Re-direct, Ramadani).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 43.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 30:2-9 (Opening, O'Donoghue).\n\ne) No handover ceremonies\n-------------------------\n\n148.\n\nFor Indonesia, Mr. Quinlivan's reliance on official ceremonies to deliver the licenses was shown to be wrong at the hearing, Mr. Ishak denying ever presiding over such ceremonies, a point that Mr. Kurniawan confirmed. Mr. Quinlivan conceded that, if Mr. Mazak's account of handover ceremonies was untrue, then it could be possible that the licenses were invalid after all.142\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 47; Tr.

Other circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Claimants was created to establish a record of legitimacy**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nTo support its case of a massive fraud scheme, Indonesia further argues that Ridlatama produced and sought to obtain from various agencies a series of documents so as to establish a record of legitimacy. Indonesia points to the following elements: (i) the MEMR maps do not prove the authenticity of the disputed mining licenses, and MEMR has no authority to issue licenses;143 (ii) the acknowledgements on Ridlatama's courier slips only confirm receipt of documents sent by Ridlatama, but do not show that the licenses were valid;144 (iii) as Mr. Gunter testified, the dead rent payments were insignificant and the seriousness bonds hardly ever paid;145 (iv) as Mr. Armin confirmed, the MEMR checklist of April 2009 provides no support for the valid registration of the purported licenses at the Regency, since the MEMR officer's function was limited to checking documents received by Ridlatama;146 (v) the 2009 police investigation dealt with trespass, not forgery, and, in any event, was conducted without knowledge of the existence of duplicate PT RTM and PT RTP licenses (Gunter Documents);147 (vi) the Bawasda team did not conduct forensic examinations and was generally unaware of the Gunter Documents as well as other forged documents;148 (vii) legal advice from Sondong, Tampubolon & Partners (\"STP\"), the \"illustrative map\" from Mr. Soehandjono, and the due diligence report of DNC do not constitute evidence as to the authenticity of the licenses since all the lawyers assumed the authenticity of the licenses;149 (viii) Churchill's press releases have no bearing on whether Mr. Ishak authorized the issuance of the disputed documents; and (ix) the process of upgrades to exploitation licenses was not properly followed.150\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 48, item 1; Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Map of Kutai Mining Area, 25 June 2007 (**Exh.

The Claimants failed to prove that the ancillary documents are authentic**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIndonesia also highlights that the Claimants failed to address at the hearing the authenticity of the so-called ancillary documents (i.e., 2007 Payment Letters (documents nos. 5-6 in the Document Table), 2008 Legality Letters (documents nos. 11-14 in the Document Table), and Cooperation Letters (documents nos. 7-10 in the Document Table)) and admitted that a finding that these documents were forged would support a finding that the licenses were equally forged.151\n\nTr. (Day 1), 29:5-8 (Opening, O'Donoghue); R-PHB1, \u00b6 51.\n\n151.\n\nTo substantiate its contention that the ancillary documents were forged, Indonesia points to the following elements: (i) Mr. Ishak gave evidence that he did not sign them or authorize their issuance; (ii) none of the documents was registered in the Regency Registration Books of Decrees and none contains a unique number; (iii) Mr. Ishak testified that he never issued payment or legality explanation letters; and (iv) these documents were created by Ridlatama to appease the Claimants.152\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 52.\n\n**1.6. The Borrow-for-Use related documents were also forged**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the Claimants also failed to address the authenticity of the Borrow-for-Use related documents (i.e., 2009 Recommendation Letters (documents nos. 19-20 in the Document Table), March 2010 Recommendation Letters (documents nos. 21-24 in the Document Table), and September 2010 Technical Considerations (documents nos. 28-31 in the Document Table)) and instead requested the Tribunal to defer its decision on that issue. Indonesia recalls that these documents \"bear the same high quality reproductions of an official's signature and other indicia of forgery\".153\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\n153.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the following elements support its contention: (i) Messrs. Ishak and Setiawan testified that they did not sign or authorize these documents; (ii) the two sets of Recommendation Letters are \"essentially identical\"; (iii) the letter numbers on the Technical Considerations belong to other documents issued by Mr. Setiawan; (iv) they also contain the incorrect NIP of Mr. Setiawan; (v) they use the wrong font and an incorrect stamp; (vi) they should contain either a signature and stamp or a signature and initial, but not all three; (vii) Mr. Setiawan did not recognize the initials; and (viii) the summaries of activities are identical when they should relate to activities in separate blocks.154\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54.\n\n**1.7. The Re-Enactment Decrees are not authentic**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent insists on what it calls the Claimants' \"change of heart\" about the Re-Enactment Decrees when they stated at the end of the hearing that they \"don't have a position either way\".155 According to Indonesia, the Claimants provided no evidence of protest by Ridlatama or themselves against the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses on 4 May 2010 and failed to explain the need for local proceedings to revoke the Revocation Decrees, if the licenses had been re-enacted.156 Even if Mr. Noor's testimony is discarded, the identical signatures and Mr. Ramadani's testimony that the Legal Section did not draft the decrees are \"strong evidence of forgery\". In addition, the decrees were never registered and show decree numbers that belong to other decrees. Finally, Indonesia argues that the Claimants had a clear motive to generate the Re-Enactment Decrees in order to avoid public disclosure of the license revocations and having to offer security.157\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56; Tr.

Ridlatama is responsible for the forgery and Mr. Mazak was aware of the scheme**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nFor the Respondent, Ridlatama had the \"means, motive and opportunity\" to forge the disputed documents.158 Mr. Ishak testified that Ridlatama was responsible for the forgery, which is corroborated by further evidence in the record, including the two versions of PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, irregular maps, the ancillary and forestry-related documents, and the Re-Enactment Decrees.159 In addition, Indonesia notes the following factors: (i) the Claimants never contested that only Ridlatama could copy and paste Mr. Ishak's signature from the original PT RP license onto the Gunter documents; (ii) Ridlatama was responsible for obtaining the relevant permits, and Mr. Kurniawan's testimony showed that he played a much smaller role than Messrs. Mudjiantoro and Wirmantono who were not presented as witnesses; (iii) Ridlatama lied about its control over the Swasembada companies, PT Swasembada Energy and PT Swasembada Bara, whose licenses bear the \"same non-handwritten signature of Mr. Ishak\"; and (iv) Ridlatama had strong economic motive to secure the licenses since it stood to gain more than USD 2 million.160\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 2.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 15.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64.\n\n156.\n\nIndonesia further accuses Mr. Mazak of being aware of Ridlatama's forgeries. In particular, Mr. Mazak (i) gave Mr. Gunter the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses containing the copy and paste signature of Mr. Ishak taken from the PT RP license; (ii) gave Ridlatama documents to Mr. Benjamin without the \"copy and paste licenses\"; (iii) told Mr. Quinlivan of fictitious handover ceremonies; (iv) sought STP advice on the bona fides of the licenses; (v) failed to ensure that the licenses were attached to the Cooperation Agreements; (vi) proposed the idea of seeking re-enactment decrees; (vii) re-emerged in April 2015 to arrange for Mr. Kurniawan to testify at the hearing and retrieve Ridlatama documents;161 and (viii) stood under pressure to produce a viable coal project after the Sendawar project proved a disappointment.162 For the Respondent, these \"damning\" revelations refute the Claimants' assertions of good faith and reinforce the argument that a finding of forgery would require the complete dismissal of the case, since it would bar the Claimants from relying on \"theories of estoppel, acquiescence and the like\".163\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 66.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 67; R-PHB2, \u00b6 3.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 3.\n\n**2.

Burden and standard of proof**\n-------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nFor Indonesia, the Claimants bear the initial burden of proving the existence of an investment, including demonstrating the authenticity of the mining licenses.164 Thus, the Claimants must \"establish that the foundational evidence supporting their claims [...] inspires at least a \u2018minimally sufficient degree of confidence in its authenticity'\".165 In view of the \"glaring indicia\" of forgery and the numerous irregularities, the Claimants have failed to make a *prima facie* case that the disputed licenses are authentic.166\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 176; Tr.

The Claimants\u2019 theories on authorization must be rejected**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the Claimants' good and bad faith authorization theories are \"implausible and unsubstantiated\".174 First, while their good faith theory might serve to explain the issuance of the disputed documents allegedly issued by Messrs. Ishak and Setiawan, they are of no assistance with respect to the Re-Enactment Decrees.175 Second, the Claimants' contention that Mr. Ishak authorized the reproduction of his signature is contradicted by the evidence, namely (i) witness testimony and comparator documents show that decrees are always signed by hand, (ii) Mr. Ishak testified that Mr. Noor was only authorized to sign documents in Mr. Noor's own name while Mr. Ishak was away, and (iii) witnesses confirmed that no high quality stamps or autopen devices are used in the Regency apart from the fact that the Claimants were unable to identify a high quality stamp device being able to reproduce the signatures.176 Third, witness evidence and comparator documents also showed that the MEMR did not have mechanical devices to reproduce signatures.177\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 5.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 6.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 7.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 9.\n\n161.\n\nIndonesia further contends that nothing supports the Claimants\u2019 bad faith authorization theory, which effectively requires the Tribunal to \"find that an unidentified person at the Regency acquired an unidentifiable stamping device to \u2018subtly' forge Ridlatama's licenses and other documents so that Ridlatama's licenses could be revoked and the rights to the EKCP auctioned to Nusantara or another party\".178 Further, with respect to the Re-Enactment Decrees, the Claimants' theory is \"rife with speculation\". Indonesia also notes the evolution in the Claimants' argumentation \"moving from silence to \u2018bemusement' to \u2018confusion' to \u2018no position' and now to \u2018bad faith authorization'\".179 It finds that their theory is \"inherently incredible\", considering that (i) the revocations had been recommended by the Minister of Forestry; (ii) internal procedures to revoke the Exploitation Licenses had been followed; and (iii) Ridlatama initiated court proceedings to challenge the revocations.180\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 11.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 13.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 13.\n\n**2.3. A finding of forgery requires the dismissal of the claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nSince all of the claims rest on the assumption of the validity of Ridlatama's rights, a finding of forgery of the Survey and Exploration Licenses would render the exploitation upgrades \"null and void\" and require that the claims be dismissed.181 In addition, Mr. Mazak's \"culpability\" and the Claimants' failure to conduct proper due diligence precludes the Claimants from invoking alternative legal theories such as estoppel or acquiescence.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 68.\n\n163.\n\nThe claims in this arbitration relate to Churchill and Planet's purported investment in the EKCP. As Mr. Quinlivan acknowledged, without valid licenses there is no EKCP.182 While the Claimants argue that \"the vast majority\" of their investments would remain legally valid notwithstanding a finding of forgery, Indonesia argues that the Claimants have identified no claim unrelated to the EKCP:\n\n(i) With respect to the claim for indirect expropriation, the Claimants concede that the licenses were the only assets of value for PT ICD and PT TCUP. A finding of forgery would render the licenses and thus the companies worthless. Relying on case law, Indonesia submits that no claim based on worthless interests may succeed;183\n\n(ii) With respect to the claim that the Nusantara extensions were unlawful, Indonesia argues that the extension of Nusantara's licenses was valid since Ridlatama had no rights over the area;184\n\n(iii) With respect to the claim that Indonesia wrongfully engendered doubt about license overlaps and forgery, Indonesia reiterates that the Nusantara extensions were valid and that the Claimants acknowledge that this claim would fall away if forgery is made out to have occurred;185\n\n(iv) With respect to the claim that forestry permits were wrongfully declined, Indonesia responds that Ridlatama had no mining rights to begin with;186\n\n(v) With respect to the claim of unreasonable, arbitrary and unjustified measures, Indonesia retorts that the measures were related to mining operations lacking valid licenses;187\n\n(vi) With respect to the claim of threat of use of force, Indonesia responds that it was proper to require Ridlatama to leave the mining area, since the mining undertaking licenses were forged and Indonesia properly revoked the upgrades;188\n\n(vii) With respect to the denial of justice claim, Indonesia argues that the claim arises from the alleged failure to take into account evidence, and thus would fail with a finding of forgery.189\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 74.

The exploitation upgrades are null and void**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, since the Survey and Exploration Licenses were forged, they are \"non-existent\", which renders the exploitation upgrades invalid.193 Therefore, \"the Regent\u2019s approval for upgrading of fake licenses to exploitation status in 2009 could not cure the fundamental defect caused or created by forgery of the original licenses\".194 This conclusion is supported both by Indonesian and international law.195 While Mr. Noor testified that he did sign the Exploitation Licenses, he did so on the assumption that all proper steps had been taken by the Mining and Energy Bureau.196 In other words, Mr. Noor was deceived into signing the exploitation upgrades. In addition, since Ridlatama had no licenses capable of being upgraded to begin with, Indonesia submits that Mr. Noor had \"no power to issue the upgrades\".197\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 9.\n\nTr.

As a general matter, the Claimants\u2019 lack of good faith, their awareness of the risks of corruption, their willful disregard of corruption, and their continued endorsement of Ridlatama\u2019s probity precludes them to rely on estoppel, legitimate expectations, acquiescence and other theories.203 Finally, while there is \"little doubt\" that Ridlatama had assistance from Mr. Putra, that would still not change the ultimate conclusion that all of the claims must be dismissed, because forged documents cannot form the basis of investment treaty claims as this would be contrary to international law and international public policy.204 Moreover, the Claimants were not good faith investors, Ridlatama could in any event not convey valid investment interests on them, and through their beneficial ownership arrangements the Claimants stepped into Ridlatama\u2019s shoes and were the \"beneficiaries of the forgery\".205\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 140.\n\nR-PHB, \u00b6 76; R-PHB2, \u00b6 41.\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 41.\n\na) Estoppel\n-----------\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants failed to meet the three criteria of estoppel, so says the Respondent, namely (i) there were no clear and unambiguous representations that the licenses were valid, and silence is not sufficient; (ii) any representations were induced by error and the relevant officials were not authorized to speak for the State; and (iii) the Claimants\u2019 lack of due diligence defeats their claim that they relied in good faith and to their detriment on the alleged representations.206\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 82-84.\n\n169.\n\nThe hearing, and in particular Messrs. Quinlivan\u2019s and Benjamin\u2019s testimonies, showed that the Claimants relied on Ridlatama\u2019s representations, not those of the State.207 Finally, Mr. Mazak\u2019s handling of duplicate PT RTM and PT RTP licenses as well as his misrepresentations regarding handover ceremonies \"are sufficient by themselves to bar the Claimants from invoking estoppel\".208\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 85.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 87.\n\nb) Acquiescence\n---------------\n\n170.\n\nAccording to Indonesia, the conditions for acquiescence must be interpreted strictly. Consequently, the State is deemed to have consented to a situation \"if it failed to object in circumstances where it was reasonably expected to object\".209 Since Indonesia had no knowledge of the facts underlying the forgery, and its purported consent was obtained by error, there can be no acquiescence.210 In any event, Indonesia's commencement of police investigations once it became aware of the forgery shows that there was no \"clear and consistent acceptance\" to treat the forged licenses as valid.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 90.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 90.\n\nc) Legitimate expectations\n--------------------------\n\n171.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants' legitimate expectations argument fails for the same reasons as their estoppel argument. Their lack of due diligence negates any claim based on legitimate expectations.211\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 92. *See* also: Respondent's letter dated 1 December 2014, pp. 16-17.\n\nd) Unjust enrichment\n--------------------\n\n172.\n\nIf the Claimants' unjust enrichment claim is based on equitable relief unrelated to any substantive protection in the BITs, so argues Indonesia, then it falls outside the Tribunal's competence for lack of *ex aequo et bono* jurisdiction.212 Attempts to present unjust enrichment as part of the FET standard must equally fail, since the BITs make no reference to unjust enrichment, and \"the \u2018FET standard' is not an amorphous point of entry for any equitable remedy that the Claimants may wish to invoke\".213 In any event, the Claimants have not shown that (i) Indonesia was enriched to the detriment of the Claimants and (ii) there was no just cause for the enrichment. There was just cause to revoke the mining licenses, namely breach of forestry laws and forgery of licenses, which defeats any unjust enrichment claim.214\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 93.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 94.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 96.\n\ne) Internationally wrongful composite act\n-----------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the theory on composite violation of FET brought forward by Churchill and Planet must fail, because the notion of composite act \"is merely concerned with the time at which a breach occurs\", thus adding nothing to Claimants\u2019 \"baseless FET claim\".215\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 97.\n\n**2.6. The Claimants are not good faith investors and failed to exercise due diligence**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nIt is Indonesia\u2019s primary case that Ridlatama forged the disputed documents and that the Claimants were duped216 and that, even if they were unaware of the forgery, the Claimants bear the burden of engaging business relations with unreliable partners.217 It is Indonesia\u2019s secondary case that Ridlatama forged the disputed documents and that the Claimants were aware of it. In this case, the Claimants\u2019 involvement evinces, at the very least, a lack of due diligence, and, in fact, recklessness.218 Although Indonesia argues that a finding of forgery and the dismissal of the claims does not require proof that the Claimants were \"culpable with Ridlatama\", it also points to the fact that the Claimants are under investigation at the London Stock Exchange for failure to disclose the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses.219\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 126.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 130.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 12.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 12.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Mazak\u2019s dissemination of forged documents and dealings with Ridlatama \"are *prima facie* evidence of complicity on his part\".220 Until the hearing, Indonesia did not accuse the Claimants of being involved in the forgery scheme. As a result of the evidence taken at the hearing, Indonesia raised accusations with respect to the involvement of Mr. Mazak in the handling of the disputed documents. The hearing showed, so says Indonesia, that Mr. Gunter obtained the second version of the Survey Licenses from Mr. Mazak, which raises questions on Mr. Mazak's role in the forgery. The fact that Mr. Ishak's signature from the PT RP license was copied and pasted onto the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses in Mr. Gunter's possession shows that the forgers of the Gunter Documents were either associated with Ridlatama or had access to that unique license (of PT RP).221\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 99.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 8.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that other instances demonstrate the Claimants' lack of good faith: (i) Mr. Gunter contradicted the Claimants' representation that he verified the expiration of the Nusantara licenses; (ii) Mr. Benjamin admitted he played no part in the Survey License applications in 2007; (iii) the Claimants failed to include the Survey Licenses as attachments to the Cooperation Agreements with Ridlatama; (iv) the 26 February 2007 Staff Analysis and the 23 March 2007 MEMR letter were only received by the Claimants in 2009 or 2010; (v) the Claimants made no attempt to verify the authenticity of the licenses when forgery allegations were first raised in 2009; (vi) they failed to obtain relevant assistance to understand how signatures are placed on mining licenses, despite Messrs. Gunter and Benjamin having such knowledge; (vii) they also failed to verify the accuracy of the 2009 report prepared by Ridlatama (and signed by the Legal Team of PT ICD) to rebut the BPK report, which report did not address the forgery indications and falsely portrayed the Swasembada companies as unrelated to Ridlatama.222 In sum, so argues the Respondent, the Claimants failed to exercise due diligence to ascertain the soundness of their investment. For Indonesia, \"Mr. Quinlivan and Claimants' principals no doubt realized that nothing was to be gained from casting doubt on Ridlatama's probity\".223\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 99-103.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 104.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. On the facts**\n-------------------\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Indonesia failed to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the disputed documents were forged and fabricated by Ridlatama, let alone to prove the existence of a \"massive, systematic and sophisticated scheme to defraud\" the Respondent.224 For the Claimants, Indonesia also failed to explain \"why the *means* of signature is probative of *who* applied the signatures\", or, in other words, why the determination of the means of signature would allow concluding that the signatures were generated by Ridlatama rather than the Regency.225\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 1.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 17.\n\n**1.1. The issuance of the disputed documents was authorized**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nFor the Claimants, the most important issue is not \"how\" the signatures were affixed on the disputed documents, nor \"who\" did so, but whether the signatures were authorized.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants start by challenging Indonesia\u2019s characterization of Mr. Ishak\u2019s testimony. Mr. Ishak did not testify that he did not sign the documents, but made various odd statements casting doubt on his reliability as a witness.226 For instance, Mr. Ishak\u2019s statement that he could not have signed the disputed Survey Licenses because he was not the Regent at the time is clearly incorrect.227 Further, his statement that \"something must have prevented him from signing\" the licenses, such as Nusantara\u2019s payment of taxes and fulfillment of other obligations, was also incorrect since Nusantara made no payments and fulfilled no obligations until November 2008 when it obtained extensions of its exploration licenses.228 Moreover, Indonesia\u2019s explanation that Mr. Ishak refused to sign as a matter of discretion is speculative and undermined by Mr. Ishak\u2019s assertion that \"[i]f it is completed, I will sign it\".229 Finally, Indonesia has not been forthcoming on the issue of authorization and whether Mr. Noor would sign decrees in Mr. Ishak\u2019s absence. For the Claimants, Mr. Ishak\u2019s testimony \"illuminated the possibility\" that Mr. Noor had authority to apply Mr. Ishak's signature (good faith authorization), or even that Mr. Noor exceeded his authority (bad faith authorization).230\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 18, referring to: Tr. (Day 3), 16:18 (Direct, Ishak).\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\n180.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants' main submission is that the signatures were authorized. Evidence gathered at the hearing establishes that decrees were signed mechanically as \"a matter of administrative necessity and convenience\", due to Mr. Ishak's frequent travels during his campaign for governorship in 2006 to 2008.231\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45; Tr. (Day 3), 76:7-8 (Tribunal, Ishak); Kurniawan WS1, \u00b6 55. At the hearing, Mr. Ishak testified that he campaigned for two years, starting in 2006. Tr. (Day 3), 77:16 (Tribunal, Ishak).\n\n181.\n\nMr. Noor was \"automatically responsible\" when Mr. Ishak was absent, having the authority to \"make and sign decrees\".232 The Claimants dispute Mr. Ishak's testimony that Mr. Noor could only sign as Deputy Regent, since the scope of Mr. Noor's authority \"is not clear\".233 For the Claimants, Mr. Noor's authority increased during Mr. Ishak's second term as Regent, i.e., during the relevant period and he \"clearly had access to original signatures of Mr. Ishak and all other apparatus needed for the creation and recording of official documents\".234 Mr. Noor's wealth and \"apparent estrangement from Mr. Ishak\" would suggest that he exceeded his authority when personal gain was at stake.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45.\n\n182.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants make the following submissions in relation to each category of disputed documents:\n\na) Survey Licenses\n------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe authenticity of the Survey Licenses (documents nos. 1-4 in the Document Table) is corroborated by the \"broadest body of evidence\" in the record, including (i) the 23 March 2007 MEMR letter to PT RTM indicating that, if Nusantara licenses expired, the area would become open;235 (ii) the \"March 2007\"236 Staff Analysis concluding that the Nusantara\u2019s licenses had lapsed and that the mining areas were open;237 (iii) spatial analyses of 21 May 2007 describing Nusantara\u2019s permits as \" *Eks* \" (or former) licenses, confirming the Staff Analysis according to which the areas were open;238 (iv) the final draft decrees bearing the undisputed coordination initials of senior Regency officials, none of whom provided evidence in this arbitration, establishing that the internal approval process \"progressed without challenge to this penultimate stage\" and evidencing that the issuance of the licenses was duly authorized;239 (v) the Garuda seal on the official licenses, which, according to Dr. Strach, suggested that the seal was affixed after the signatures were placed on the licenses;240 (vi) 79 separate government acknowledgements of the Survey Licenses;241 (vii) the MEMR registration of the Survey Licenses, about which the Claimants explained that the MEMR relied on its own maps to issue official documents, and that Mr. Ishak acknowledged the \"key role\" played by the MEMR, not the Regency, when determining the status of mining areas.242\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 46(a); Letter from Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to President Director of Ridlatama Mineral, 23 March 2007 (**Exh. C-37**).\n\nClaimants explain the discrepancy in the dates by arguing that the Staff Analysis must have been commenced on 26 February 2007, shortly after receipt of the Ridlatama applications, but was finalized in March 2007 after the MEMR letter of 23 March 2007. C-PHB1, note 153.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 46(b); Evaluation from Kutai Head of Mining Service Office, 26 February 2007 (**Exh. C-34**).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 46(c).

(Day 3), 69:23-70:2 (Cross, Ishak).\n\n184.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants rebut Indonesia\u2019s arguments on procedural irregularities as follows: (i) the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses were properly registered in the registration book of the Legal Section; (ii) the PT INP and PT IR licenses were also registered albeit under an incorrect date, which appears to be a clerical error also found on other decrees produced by Indonesia; (iii) Indonesia\u2019s account that Mr. Putra failed to provide the original licenses is based on \"*aged* hearsay\" of Mr. Ramadani, who was not involved in processing mining licenses until 2012;243 and (iv) with respect to the duplicate PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, Mr. Gunter testified that it is not unusual to have \"different generations\" of documents and that he saw \"a large variety of different types\" of licenses, including internal documents, to allow applicants to verify the correctness of the mining area coordinates, which sometimes contained the page with the coordination initials.244\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 21(b) (emphasis in the original).\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 21(c); Tr.

Armin and Ordiansyah. Mr. Armin confirmed that, on that day, Mr. Ariyadi compiled a checklist of Ridlatama\u2019s documents confirming that PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP, and PT IR had received general survey and exploration licenses.252\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 48(g). **Exh.

Nevertheless, the Claimants note that the disputed documents bear the official seal, and that the certificates of legality have been acknowledged 38 times by three levels of government (there is no such acknowledgement of the Cooperation Letters).258 As to the absence of registration, the Claimants reiterate their reason to doubt the reliability of the copy of the registration book produced by Indonesia, further pointing to possible modifications in the entries on 8 and 9 April 2008.259\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 51.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 51(b). **Exh.

Mazak and Basrewan267 and Churchill is not a fraudster. Circumventing the disclosure of the revocation at the AIM would be extremely short-sighted, according to the Claimants. The Tribunal should find that the Re-Enactment Decrees were authorized \"but in the bad faith sense\".268 Indeed, they are the only documents that favor Indonesia\u2019s contention that Mr. Noor was deceived into signing the Exploitation Licenses.269\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 28.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69\n\n192.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants insist on a number of corroborating elements which the Tribunal should also keep in mind: (i) the findings of the 2009 Sangatta police investigation which held that the mining licenses had been properly registered; (ii) the Bawasda report according to which the licenses were \"legal and accountable\"; (iii) the draft due diligence report of DNC; (iv) the review conducted by Mr. Soehandjono; (v) the due diligence of STP concluding that the licenses were \"valid, unencumbered and legally enforceable\"; and (vi) the fact that the licenses were revoked for alleged breaches of forestry law, not for forgery.270\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 50.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants further dispute Indonesia\u2019s argument with respect to the alleged irregularities on the various maps. Indeed, the Respondent failed to produce a digital database of the Planology Office, despite Mr. Ordiansyah having acknowledged that hard copies of all maps were kept in various offices of the Regency.271 For the Claimants, (i) the absence of Mr. Ordiansyah's initials is not peculiar to the disputed licenses, but is a common \"irregularity\" in undisputed documents;272 (ii) Mr. Ordiansyah described an \" *ad hoc* map-approval process\" which indicates that not all maps were generated by the Planology Office and that \"as long as a map was registered in the Planology Office's database, it was an official map\";273 (iii) the English expressions in the maps attached to the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses appear to be the work of high school students having joined the Planology Office, rather than that of sophisticated fraudsters; and (iv) other irregularities may be explained by the then \"rudimentary systems\" of the Planology Office, as can be seen from the undisputed map attached to the PT Bara Energi Makmur license which was \"issued five months before to the RTM and RTP general survey licenses\", and which bears no initial of Mr. Ordiansyah, no legend, no scale, no indication of North, unusual insets, no source, and no indication of production forests.274\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 19; C-PHB2, \u00b6 21(d).\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this occurs in 4 out of 20 maps produced by Indonesia for the years 2007-2008.

C-496**.\n\n194.\n\nAll the ancillary documents, which the Respondent misleadingly seeks to discount as \"peripheral documents\", are \"evidence of *process* \" confirming that Ridlatama was operating with the \"knowledge and consent\" of Indonesia.275 Churchill and Planet therefore reject Indonesia's attempts to fill gaps in its case with allegations of more crime either by an insider of the Regency, or by Ridlatama or Churchill. This is especially true where Indonesia did not produce any report of its police investigations and thus puts the Tribunal in the position of being requested to make findings that Indonesia's own police have been unable to make.276\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 2.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that the clerical errors identified on the disputed documents show the lack of \"cohesive and administrative process\" in the Regency during the relevant period and cannot substantiate a finding of forgery.277\n\nC-Reply, Annex C, Table of Irregularities.\n\n**1.2. The copy and paste signatures on the Gunter Documents could have been generated inside the Regency**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants dispute Indonesia\u2019s contention that only Ridlatama had access to the original Ishak signature/stamp combinations found on the PT RP license, which were copied and pasted onto the Gunter Documents (documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table). Indeed, Mr. Ordiansyah testified that the Planology Office made digital copies of final licenses278 and other witnesses confirmed that the \"group of custodians of the relevant Ishak master signature\" was much larger than portrayed by Indonesia.279\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 9; Tr.

On the law**\n-----------------\n\n**2.1. Burden and standard of proof**\n-------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is for the Respondent to prove its forgery allegations. In addition, the Claimants argue that the Respondent must provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the disputed documents were forged or fabricated by Ridlatama.\n\n199.\n\nIf the Tribunal were not minded to draw adverse inferences, it should dismiss the Application for Dismissal \"for lack of evidence\", Indonesia not having proved its case under either standard: clear and convincing evidence or balance of probabilities.281\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 5.\n\n200.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimants also referred to the standard of \"cogent evidence\" employed by the English High Court and referred to international tribunals, in particular the US-Iran Claims Tribunal.282 In this context, the Claimants accepted that the documentary record was not perfect, that certain inconsistencies \"cannot be explained\", notably because Indonesia did not provide relevant evidence. The resulting \"ambiguity or doubt\" must be decided against the Respondent, because the evidence as a whole supports the validity of the disputed documents.283\n\nTr. (Day 7), 193:22-194:1 (Closing, Sheppard).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 194:2-195:11 (Closing, Sheppard).\n\n**2.2. Adverse inferences**\n---------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences with respect to the documents that the Respondent was ordered but failed to produce284 and to Indonesia's failure to present key witnesses, such as Messrs. Zainuddin Aspan, Djaja Putra and Isran Noor.285\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 10-30.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 31-37.\n\n202.\n\nAccording to Churchill and Planet, since the Respondent has exclusive control over the documents which it did not produce, the Tribunal should adopt a liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence, as the ICJ did in *Corfu Channel*.286 In addition, out of 333 documents produced by the Respondent, 251 were Nusantara documents. Further, for 15 categories of documents, the Respondent only produced 45 comparator documents - out of which 25 related to Nusantara and 12 were already in the record.287\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 11(a); C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31; *Corfu Channel Case*, Merits Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 18 (**Exh. CLA-209**).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 11(b).\n\n203.\n\nMoreover, so emphasize the Claimants, the testimony of the Respondent's own witnesses confirmed the existence of documents responsive to certain requests. This is particularly the case of the following 5 (sets of) documents:\n\ni. Mr. Ishak confirmed the existence of the application book of the Regent of East Kutai;288\n\nii. Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed the existence of a hard copy of the maps depicting forest and mining areas for the relevant time;289\n\niii. Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that a copy of the digital database of the Planology Office could be produced;290\n\niv. Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that his office had the spatial analyses created in relation to Ridlatama\u2019s applications;291\n\nv. Although Indonesia claimed that the four 3 March 2009 Recommendation Letters did not exist, it belatedly produced them on 6 July 2015.292\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 11(b), note 29, \u00b6 12(a); Claimants' First DPR No. 20; Tr.

Regency register books\n\na. Application book of the Regent: Mr. Ramadani indicated that applications were registered in that book and Mr. Ishak confirmed its existence at the hearing.\n\nb. Registration book of the Mining and Energy Bureau: In light of Mr. Armin\u2019s confirmation of the book\u2019s general nature, the Respondent\u2019s inability to locate it is \"highly improbable\".\n\nc. Legal Section register book: the \"low-resolution copy\" produced causes concern that various relevant entries may not be reproduced faithfully.293\n\nAdverse inference: The production of the books just listed would have proved (i) the existence of the Survey and Exploration Licenses,\n\n(ii) the regular processing of the Exploitation Licenses and\n\n(iii) Nusantara\u2019s belated applications for extension.294\n\nii. Comparator mining licenses :\n\nIndonesia only produced 22 documents for the years 2007 and 2008, although it initially objected to the request as overly burdensome because it involved some 150 documents per year.295 Of these 22, only 2 were originals and 6 were Nusantara licenses. Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that a digital copy is made of every mining license, putting to rest Indonesia's excuse that it could not find hard copies.\n\nAdverse inference: The production would not have assisted Indonesia's contention that \"the Regent \u2018 *always signed decrees by hand* ' or that the Ridlatama licenses are irregular in terms of their form\".296\n\niii. Comparator legality and Cooperation Letters :\n\nIndonesia's \"alternative submission of fact\" (i.e., Mr. Ishak never issued such documents, but if they were issued they would be immaterial to forgery) is an admission that such letters were issued by Mr. Ishak.297 In addition, the certificates that Mr. Noor signed by hand (and which are \"in substantially the same form\" as the Cooperation and Legality Letters bearing Mr. Ishak's signature) further suggest that the Regency issued such documents.298\n\nAdverse inference: The production would not support Indonesia's position that \"such letters are never issued or that the Ridlatama legality and cooperation letters were forged\".299\n\niv. Planology Office maps :\n\nIndonesia only produced 18 maps attached to the Nusantara's licenses.300 Mr. Ordiansyah admitted that, for each map, three sheets are produced,301 that the Planology Office keeps copies of every map,302 and that the Legal Section and Mining Bureau also keep hard copies.303 He also conceded that a digital copy of the database could be made.304\n\nAdverse inference: The failure to produce existing documents allows the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences that these maps would not have assisted Indonesia\u2019s case that \"(i) all Planology Office maps complied with the criteria set out by the State\u2019s witnesses and (ii) that an inference of forgery can be drawn from any map that does not\".305\n\nv. MEMR maps :\n\nThe significance of the MEMR maps lies in their display of the evolution of title over the EKCP, showing in particular Ridlatama\u2019s valid title until 18 May 2010 and the appearance of an overlap with Nusantara only on 13 October 2010.306 Beyond the maps already in the record, Indonesia failed to produce any further MEMR maps or materials generated by the MEMR in relation to the EKCP.307\n\nAdverse inference: The production would not have supported the Respondent\u2019s contention that \"the Ridlatama licences were never recognized by the State\".308\n\nvi. Ridlatama spatial analyses :\n\nIndonesia misled the Tribunal when stating that the Planology Office did not write spatial analyses in relation to Ridlatama\u2019s applications. Mr. Gunter produced spatial analyses for PT RTM and PT RTP (depicting Nusantara\u2019s exploration permits as \" *Eks* \", i.e. former),309 and Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that he prepared and signed them, and that he has copies in his office.310\n\nAdverse inference: Indonesia did not produce responsive documents because it \"considers their content - namely the description of Nusantara permits as \u2018 *Eks* ' (or \u2018former') - is unhelpful to its case\".311\n\nvii. Nusantara spatial analyses :\n\nIndonesia failed to produce any responsive documents, although Mr. Ordiansyah admitted that the Planology Office carried out such an analysis.\n\nAdverse inference: The production would not have supported Indonesia's contention that \"the areas for which Nusantara was applying were not already held by Ridlatama\".312\n\nviii. Police files :\n\nWhile Indonesia has argued that secrecy governs the investigations of its national police, it has not provided any documents from other police agencies, such as the Sangatta police.\n\nAdverse inference: The Tribunal may infer that it has obtained the best evidence about Ridlatama's involvement and that the content of the police files would not support Indonesia's case of a \"massive, systematic and sophisticated scheme to defraud the Republic\".313 None of the investigations has led to any prosecution of Ridlatama personnel.\n\nix. State investigations into Messrs. Ishak and Noor :\n\nThe hearing revealed that corruption may have existed at the Regency during the relevant period.\n\nAdverse inference: The production of the Indonesian Corruption Eradication Commission (*Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi* or \"KPK\") files would not have supported \"Mr. Ishak\u2019s credibility as a witness on matters material to the State\u2019s case\".314\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 12(c). In particular, the Claimants point to differences with two items between the copy on record (**Exh. C-479(b)**, pp. 16-17) and the content of the same volume recorded in the BPK Report (**Exh. R-032**, p. 11), namely (i) decree number 169 (additional notation) and (ii) decree number 171 (change of date).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 13.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167; C-PHB1, \u00b6 14.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 15.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 16.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 16, referring to Certification letters (**Exh.

Mr. Zainuddin Aspan: the hearing showed that Mr. Ramadani (who worked in the litigation branch of the Legal Section until 2012) was not involved in processing mining applications during the relevant period, and that Indonesia should instead have presented the head of the Legal Section, Mr. Aspan, since he (i) received draft licenses from the licensing subdivision, (ii) put his coordination initials on the PT RTM and PT RTP draft decrees, (iii) supervised the circulation of the drafts to other sections, and (iv) acknowledged Ridlatama\u2019s Exploration Licenses by signing and stamping them. Had Mr. Aspan been called as a witness by the Respondent, so say the Claimants, \"his evidence would not have supported the State\u2019s forgery/fraud case\".315\n\nii. Mr. Djaja Putra: Mr. Ishak confirmed Mr. Putra\u2019s central role as head of the Mining Bureau in handling mining licenses during the relevant period. Mr. Putra (i) drafted the 2007 Staff Analysis, (ii) co-signed the PT RTM and PT RTP spatial analyses, (iii) initialed the draft PT RTM and PT RTP decrees, (iv) drafted the 2008 Nusantara Staff Analysis, and (v) directly liaised with Mr. Noor. Had Mr. Putra been called as a witness by the Respondent, so say the Claimants, \"his evidence would not have supported the State\u2019s forgery/fraud case\".316\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 37.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 37.\n\n206.\n\nFinally, the Claimants oppose the adverse inferences sought by Indonesia. They did not present Mr. Mazak as a witness, since they offered the most appropriate witnesses to respond to Indonesia\u2019s case on authenticity as it stood prior to the hearing, i.e. that the Claimants were dupes fooled by Ridlatama, not that they were fraudsters as Indonesia now contends.317\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n**2.3. Authorized licenses would prove the validity of all other disputed documents**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nFor the Claimants, if the Tribunal finds that the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses were validly issued, then all other disputed documents bearing the identical signatures would have been validly issued. This applies to the Exploration Licenses, the Payment Requests, the Cooperation Letters and the Legality Letters.318\n\nTr. (Day 1), 129:19-23 and 132:3-6 (Opening, Sheppard).\n\n208.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants acknowledge that a finding that the Re-Enactment Decrees were not authorized would \"add weight to the State's circumstantial case against the other disputed documents\".319\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 67.\n\n**2.4. Good faith and bad faith authorization**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIt is the Claimants' main submission that the Regency authorized the issuance of the disputed documents, in particular of the Mining Licenses.320 In support, the Claimants rely on two alternative theories, good faith and bad faith authorization, both of which lead to the conclusion that the disputed documents were authorized.321\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 4.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 5.\n\n210.\n\nAccording to the first theory of good faith authorization, Mr. Ishak's signature was regularly applied by one of his subordinates (e.g. Mr. Noor or Mr. Putra) using a high-quality stamp \"or some other printing technology\" with Mr. Ishak's knowledge and consent.322 The \"natural progression\" of the application process supports such a finding (i.e., application, staff analysis, spatial analysis, coordination draft, affixation of the chop, entry in Registration Book of Decrees). The hearing also showed that Mr. Ishak authorized his subordinates to \"sign official documents on his behalf\" when he was travelling.323\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 6.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 6.\n\n211.\n\nUnder the second theory of bad faith authorization, some insider in the Regency engaged in a \"design to make the licences being issued to Ridlatama \u2018 *plausibly deniable* '\" so as to be able to \"illegally revoke\" them later once Ridlatama would have found commercially viable quantities of coal.324 In this scenario, Ridlatama and the Claimants are \"victims\" and Indonesia is bound by the licenses it issued.325 Churchill and Planet insist in this context that Indonesia has not established that Ridlatama was aware of any such scheme.326\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 7.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 8.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 54, note 217.\n\n**2.5. The Tribunal should reject Indonesia\u2019s accusations against Mr. Mazak and Indonesia is estopped from further accusing Churchill**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nFor the Claimants, Indonesia\u2019s contentions that new facts emerged at the hearing justifying accusations against Mr. Mazak should be given short shrift. In March and July 2015, Indonesia stated that it had no accusations against Churchill.327 Its own police investigations did not reveal any wrongdoing by Mr. Mazak, thus allowing the Tribunal to \"assume (logically) or infer (adversely)\" that Indonesia knew Mr. Mazak\u2019s role in relation to the disputed documents when it made its statements earlier in 2015.328 In essence, Mr. Mazak is now accused as a result of a process of elimination, since \"he is the only person yet to give evidence\".329 In this context, the Claimants highlight that Indonesia never raised issues about Mr. Mazak prior to the hearing and did not put any of these new accusations to the Claimants\u2019 witnesses during cross-examinations.330\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 6. The Claimants refer to: Respondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal, 23 March 2015, p. 4; R-Comments 2, \u00b6 41.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 8.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 8.\n\n213.\n\nFurthermore, Indonesia\u2019s new allegation that Churchill structured its investment to facilitate the alleged fraud is \"ambush\", as the Claimants prepared their defense on the basis of the record as it stood before the hearing and of the representations which Indonesia made in March and July 2015. In this regard, the Claimants also point to Mr. Ishak\u2019s apparent apology to Churchill at the hearing.331\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 6.\n\n214.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s fresh allegations are baseless and should not be entertained. In light of Indonesia\u2019s prior representations, the Claimants seek a declaration that Indonesia is \"estopped and precluded from pressing these new allegations against the Claimants\".332 In any event, the coordination initials on the draft decrees establish that the applications were processed until the final stages, thus doing away with Indonesia's contention that Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah declined to process the PT RTM and PT RTP applications.333\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 6.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 10.\n\n**2.6. Legal consequences of a finding of forgery**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nFor the Claimants, the question of legal consequences is moot if the disputed documents are found not to be forged or fabricated.334 In the event of a finding of forgery, the Claimants argue that there are distinct legal consequences of forgery or of fraud.335 In any event, the Claimants submit that the legal consequences would be \"very limited\" under both scenarios (forgery and fraud), as the \"vast majority of the Claimants' investments will remain legally valid\".336\n\nReply, \u00b6 202.\n\nReply, \u00b6 202.\n\nReply, \u00b6 203.\n\n216.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants refer to the description of their investments in their Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, where they submit that their investments are composed of (i) shares in PT ICD as well as in PT TCUP; (ii) an indirect interest in Ridlatama's shares in PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR; (iii) contractual and shareholding interests, through PT ICD, in the Ridlatama Companies and the EKCP; (iv) Ridlatama's mining licenses; (v) feasibility studies and other intellectual property tied to the EKCP; (vi) monies invested through PT ICD; and (vii) goodwill in the Indonesian mining services market.337 Thus, even assuming that the licenses were forged, \"the vast majority of these investments will remain legally valid *investments* \",338 with the value of certain components changing.\n\nReply, \u00b6 231, referring to Claimants' Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 294-295.\n\nReply, \u00b6 233.\n\n217.\n\nSpecifically, with the exception of the disputed mining licenses, (i) all shares will remain legally valid securities, although their value might change; (ii) the contractual interests are unaffected, although their value might change; (iii) the feasibility studies and other intellectual property remain legally valid, their value being susceptible to change; (iv) the amounts invested would not change; and (v) the goodwill would also remain, subject to determining its value, if the licenses were forged by someone other than the Claimants.339\n\nReply, \u00b6 233.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Indonesia failed to provide a cogent legal reason why a finding of forgery would lead to the \"drastic conclusion\" of dismissal of the entire case.340 More particularly, they submit the following arguments on the legal consequences of a finding of forgery of the disputed documents:\n\ni. If the Survey and Exploration Licenses are forged or unauthorized, that would not dispose of the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian and international law. Although Indonesia initially contended that a finding of forgery would be dispositive of the claims, it admitted at the hearing that a factual finding of forgery would not determine the legal question of the validity of the disputed licenses, nor of the Exploitation Licenses.341\n\nWhether an exploitation license can be issued if preceding licenses were improper is a question of Indonesian law on which Indonesia presented no arguments or expert evidence.342 As a matter of Indonesian law, the Exploitation Licenses are \"stand-alone administrative acts\" that perfected Ridlatama\u2019s title to the EKCP and superseded all other previous licenses (whether authorized or not).343 Indonesia\u2019s contention that the exploitation licenses are infected with \"procedural deviations\" is ill-founded since Indonesia\u2019s argument rests on an \"established\" procedure within the Regency, which has proven not to exist. Indeed, Indonesia conceded that it lacked \"a well established procedure\" and Mr. Ishak even testified that \"anything can happen\".344\n\nWith respect to the procedural deviations mentioned by Indonesia, the Claimants provide the following responses: (i) the fact that Ridlatama filed multiple applications is irrelevant since Indonesia made no submissions on whether such course of action was possible; (ii) the fact that the upgrades created an overlap with Nusantara's exploration licenses is no proof of deviating procedures in light of Mr. Gunter's testimony that over 5000 overlaps of mining licenses exist in Indonesia, a situation created exclusively by Indonesia and its officials; (iii) Indonesia did not dispute that the Regency drafted and issued the exploitation upgrades and therefore cannot rely on \"unusual language\" therein to cast doubt on their validity; (iv) the fact that the attached maps have some irregularities cannot be used against the Claimants since other maps also have irregularities and Indonesia did not produce a digital database of the Planology Office; (v) the fact that someone outside the Mining and Energy Bureau picked up the upgrades is irrelevant to the existence of deviations in the issuance of the upgrades; and (vi) Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah confirmed that they attended the feasibility study presentation on 28-29 April 2009 \"in circumstances in which they now say Ridlatama did not hold general survey or exploration licenses for the area the subject of the presentation\".345\n\nIn sum, for the Claimants, Indonesia's contention that something went awry in the processing of the exploitation upgrades is unsubstantiated, just like its argument that corruption may be involved.346 In addition, Mr. Noor's refusal to attend the hearing and the exclusion of his evidence dispose of the Respondent's case on the Exploitation Licenses, which leads to the conclusion that these licenses must stand.347\n\nii. With respect to the Legality and Cooperation Letters, Indonesia did not establish the legal consequences which the holder of a mining license incurs in the event that no valid approval has been granted.348 In any event, it never argued that these ancillary documents have any \"direct consequences in terms of dismissal\".349\n\niii. Like the previous category, the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations have \"no direct value as investments\" and no impact on the Claimants' case. As a matter of Indonesian and international law, the absence of borrow-for-use permits, or breaches of forestry law, in no event justify the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses.350 Ms. Nurohmah confirmed this understanding of Indonesian law when she denied having heard of license revocations as a result of lacking borrow-for-use permits.351\n\niv. The same argumentation applies to the Technical Recommendations.\n\nv. Finally, the Re-Enactment Decrees may well have been authorized in a \"bad faith sense\" as part of a scheme of Mr. Noor aiming at denying the validity of the Ridlatama licenses.352 If the Re-Enactment Decrees were forged or unauthorized the only consequence would be that claims for restitution of amounts spent between the re-enactments and the dismissal of the Samarinda court actions would be barred.353 The allegations that Churchill was implicated in the fraud and sought to avoid disclosure before the AIM is \"unbelievable\". Such short-sighted conduct would readily be discovered, put the share value of the Claimants at risk and expose their personnel to criminal liability.354 For the Claimants, the \"more plausible explanation\" is that someone within the Regency wanted to reverse Mr. Noor\u2019s prior mistake of handing the licenses back to Nusantara.355\n\nReply, \u00b6 204(a).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 58; Tr.

The Claimants specify that Indonesia\u2019s reference to three articles in the 2009 Mining Law do not support Indonesia\u2019s proposition, while Law No. 11 of 1967 on the Basic Provisions of Mining, which applied at the time the disputed licenses were issued, contains not a single provision allowing to conclude that the validity of exploitation licenses depends on the validity of prior licenses.

CLA-216**).\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that Indonesia is estopped from disputing the validity of the licenses. Estoppel derives from the facts that the Regency conducted itself \"in a manner that communicated to the Claimants that the Ridlatama licences were valid\" and the Claimants detrimentally and reasonably relied on the licenses to further invest in the EKCP.360 Indonesia failed to exercise due care, management and control over the disputed mining areas and the Claimants \"relied in good faith on the representations and assurances of the Regency and its officials as to the validity of the licences\".361 If only Ridlatama is found to have engaged in forgery or fraud (to the exclusion of the Claimants and of insiders within the Regency), Indonesia would still be estopped from denying rights under the mining licenses or be held to have acquiesced to their validity. On the other hand, if Ridlatama is held to have operated with the assistance of a Regency insider, the Respondent would have breached the FET standard in the BITs (bad faith conduct, lack of transparency, and breach of legitimate expectations).362\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 75; C-PHB2, \u00b6 27.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 75; C-PHB2, \u00b6 27, referring to the various representations listed in the Updated Annex. For the Claimants, the Exploitation Licenses \"must be treated as representations (by a person who unquestionably had \u2018 *competence to speak for the State'*) that were *voluntary, unconditional* and *authorized* \".\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 77.\n\nb) Acquiescence\n---------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants stress that acquiescence and estoppel are not \"the same thing\" although they are often linked.363 Thus, the two claims have independent legal foundations.\n\nReply, \u00b6 215.\n\n223.\n\nFor the Claimants, regardless any *ex post* finding of fraud, Indonesia acquiesced during the relevant period by allowing \"an existing legal or factual situation to continue\", including by accepting rent payments and being aware of the Claimants' exploration activities in circumstances where it could or should have objected. This is in particular so because Indonesia argues that it allegedly \"knew Nusantara was maintaining its title throughout 2007 and 2008\".364\n\nReply, \u00b6 246.\n\nc) Legitimate expectations / FET\n--------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, where an investor invokes estoppel (or acquiescence), there often is a \"concurrent (or consequential) claim\" under the legitimate expectations component of the FET standard. Relying on case law, the Claimants therefore argue that there is \"commonality between the way an FET-backed legitimate expectation is generated and the way an estoppel arises\".365\n\nReply, \u00b6 218.\n\nd) Unjust enrichment\n--------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the FET standard also accommodates \"a number of other general principles of international law\", including unjust enrichment, as *Saluka* and other decisions confirmed.366 They concede that illegality may be a bar to an unjust enrichment claim, but only where the illegality is imputed to the party raising the unjust enrichment claim. To the extent that the Respondent does not allege that the Claimants were involved in the alleged forgery, Indonesia may not oppose an illegality defense to the unjust enrichment.367\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 219-220, referring to: *Saluka Investments BV v.

On this basis, Churchill and Planet argue that Indonesia\u2019s \"pattern of misconduct - including the conduct that underpins the denial of justice claim and the threats of force claim - constitutes a composite internationally wrongful act\".371\n\nReply, \u00b6 222.\n\nReply, \u00b6 225.\n\n**V. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n228.\n\nThis part first deals with preliminary matters (A). The Tribunal thereafter goes into a detailed assessment of the Respondent's allegations of forgery and the existence of a fraudulent scheme (B) and then draws the appropriate legal consequences (C). Wherever appropriate, it first sets out the Parties' positions before going into the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**A. Preliminary issues**\n-------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThis section addresses whether one or two awards should be rendered (1), the scope of this Award (2), the law applicable to this phase of the proceedings (3), the burden and standard of proof (4), adverse inferences (5), and the relevance of previous decisions or awards (6).\n\n**1. One or two award(s)?**\n---------------------------\n\n230.\n\nProcedural Order No. 4 provided that the Tribunal would decide whether to issue one or two awards after further consultation with the Parties. Lacking an agreement on the number of decisions/awards, the Tribunal resolved to issue two decisions on jurisdiction.\n\n231.\n\nFollowing an invitation of the Tribunal to provide their views in relation to the present ruling, the Parties consented on 27 September 2016 to the issuance of a single decision/award. On this basis, the Tribunal renders a single award.\n\n**2. Scope of this Award**\n--------------------------\n\n232.\n\nIn paragraph 5 of PO20, the Tribunal confirmed its prior directions in paragraph 34 of PO15 and paragraph 28 of PO13, in the following terms:\n\n\"Having considered the positions set forth by the Parties at the end of the hearing, the Tribunal confirms that the Parties are to address matters falling within the scope of Procedural Order No. 15 especially paragraph 34. In other words, the Parties shall address (i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or not and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery. Matter (i) includes the question whether, if they were not handwritten, the impugned signatures were affixed with authority. Matter (ii) about the legal position in the event of forgery does not cover the effect of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses on the exploitation licenses\".\n\n233.\n\nAccordingly, this Award deals with (i) the factual aspects of forgery (B) and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery (C). It is structured accordingly.\n\n**3. Applicable law**\n---------------------\n\n234.\n\nWith respect to the law applicable to the merits, the Tribunal must rely on Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable\".\n\n235.\n\nThe Parties have not agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of the Respondent\u2019s Application for Dismissal.372 Consequently, the Tribunal shall apply, in addition to the two BITs, Indonesian law and international law when appropriate. The Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law.373\n\n*See*, for instance: C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 23, 206; R-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 182-185, 189-191.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, \u00b6 179; *Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, \u00b6 117.\n\n236.\n\nWhen applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle *iura novit curia* - or better, *iura novit arbiter* - allows the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not surprise the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could not anticipate.374\n\n*See*, e.g., *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, \u00b6 295 (\"[...] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte*, rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"). *See* also *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case* (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, 25 July 1974, \u00b6 18 (\"[i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL Case, Award, 23 April 2012, \u00b6 141; *Metal-Tech Ltd.* *v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00b6 287 (**Exh. RLA-155**) ; *Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, \u00b6 118.\n\n**4. Burden and standard of proof**\n-----------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants carry the burden of making a *prima facie* showing that the disputed licenses were validly issued. The Respondent further argues that the appropriate standard of proof is the one of balance of probabilities. By contrast, the Claimants reply that the Respondent bears the burden of proving its allegation of forgery. Moreover, for the Claimants, given the seriousness of the allegations, the applicable standard of proof is \"clear and convincing evidence\".\n\n238.\n\nStarting with the burden of proof, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to apply international law to this issue, since the claims brought in this arbitration seek to establish the responsibility of a State for breach of the latter's international obligations.375 It is a well-established rule in international law that each Party bears the burden of proving the facts which it alleges (*actori incumbit onus probandi*).376 Since the Respondent alleges that the Survey and Exploration Licenses and related documents are forged and that the Exploitation Licenses were obtained through deception, the Respondent bears the burden of proving its allegations of forgery and deception.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICISD Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00b6 237 (**Exh. RLA-155**).\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICISD Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00b6 237 (**Exh. RLA-155**). *See* also: *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals* *S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, \u00b6 438 (**Exh. RLA-146**). And further, for instance: *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America)*, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1984, p. 437, \u00b6 101; *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay)*, Judgment, ICJ Reports 2010, p. 71, \u00b6 162; *Marvin Feldman v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, \u00b6 177; *Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA) v.

United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, 25 August 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 8.8-8.9.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal then turns to the standard of proof, about which the Parties disagree as well. The Respondent considers that allegations of forgery and of fraud must be shown on a balance of probabilities. By contrast, the Claimants are of the view that the highest standard of clear and convincing evidence must apply to prove forgery and fraud.\n\n240.\n\nSome tribunals have applied the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence due to the gravity of a finding of forgery or fraud.377 Others, however, have considered that the common law standard of the balance of probabilities or its civil law counterpart of \" *intime conviction\"* is sufficiently flexible to assess an act of forgery or fraud in a commercial setting, it being understood that the evidence must be commensurate with the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the overall context. The *Libananco* tribunal for instance manifested this view as follows:\n\n\"[Allegations of fraud] *may* simply require *more persuasive evidence*, in the case of a fact that is *inherently improbable*, in order for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the burden of proof has been discharged\".378\n\n*See*, for instance: *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, \u00b6 326 (**Exh. CLA-225**) ; *EDF (Services) Limited. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 221 (**Exh. CLA-226**) ; *Dadras International and Per-Am Construction Corporation v. The Islamic Republic of Iran and Tehran Redevelopment Company,* Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Award No. 567-213/215-3, 7 November 1995, \u00b6\u00b6 123-124 (**Exh. CLA-218**) ; *Himpurna California Energy Ltd. (Bermuda) v. PT. (Pesero) Perrusahaan Listruik Negara (Indonesia),* UNCITRAL, Award, 4 May 1999, \u00b6 116 (**Exh. CLA-220**).\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal. *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/7, Award, 2 September 2011, \u00b6 125 (**Exh. RLA-146**).\n\n241.\n\nLord Hoffmann expressed the same idea in an eloquent illustration:\n\n\"[S]ome things are inherently more likely than others. It would need more cogent evidence to satisfy one that the creature seen walking in Regent's Park was more likely than not to have been a lioness than to be satisfied to the same standard of probability that it was an Alsatian. On this basis, cogent evidence is generally required to satisfy a civil tribunal that a person has been fraudulent or behaved in some other reprehensible manner. But the question is always whether the tribunal thinks it more probable than not\".379\n\n*Secretary of State for the Home Department v Rehman* [2001] UKHL 47, [2003] 1 AC 153 (Lord Hoffmann), \u00b6 55. See: Tr. (Day 1), 110:20-111:2 and 111:18-112:7 (Tribunal, Sheppard). *See* also: *In Re B (Children) (FC) Appellate Committee* [2008] UKHL 35 (Lord Hoffmann), \u00b6 72 **(Exh. RLA-225)**.\n\n242.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants assert that the Respondent must prove intent and motive.380 The Respondent rejects this proposition on the ground that there is no general requirement of *mens rea* or intent in investment treaty practice where a party alleges that a document was forged.381\n\n*See*, for instance: Reply, \u00b6 21.\n\n*See*, for instance: R-Answers, \u00b6 189.\n\n243.\n\nWhile intent and motive may be required for a criminal act of forgery or fraud, the present proceedings are not aimed at establishing criminal liability. Here the Tribunal must determine whether the impugned documents are authentic for purposes of an action seeking to engage the international responsibility of a State. In this context, the Respondent is right that motive and intent are not required, but may form part of the circumstantial evidence to be considered in assessing authenticity.\n\n244.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent carries the burden of proving forgery and fraud, which proof will be measured on a standard of balance of probabilities or *intime conviction* taking into account that more persuasive evidence is required for implausible facts, it being specified that intent or motive need not be shown for a finding of forgery or fraud but may form part of the relevant circumstantial evidence. The Tribunal will assess all the available evidence on record and weigh it in the context of all relevant circumstances.\n\n**5. Document production and adverse inferences**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nEach Party requested that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the other Party's failure to produce certain documents contrary to the Tribunal's order or to present witnesses at the hearing. More specifically, the Claimants assert that the Respondent failed to produce a large number of documents. These documents are enumerated in paragraph 204 above, to which the Tribunal refers. The Claimants further seek adverse inferences from the Respondent's failure to present Messrs. Noor, Putra and Aspan as witnesses, as set out in paragraph 205 to which the Tribunal refers.\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent responded to the Claimants' requests by stating that no adverse inferences should be drawn and providing various reasons, including the non-existence of certain documents, poor archiving procedures, and privilege. The Respondent also stated that the Tribunal \"may draw such inferences as it deems appropriate\" from the Claimants' failure to produce a number of \"significant documents that should have been in their possession\" and to call Messrs. Basrewan and Mazak as witnesses.382\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to produce the following documents: PT RTM\u2019s application dated 20 March 2007 for a General Survey License; Ridlatama\u2019s requests for legality explanation letters dated 12 February 2008; Ridlatama\u2019s requests for cooperation letters dated 14 February 2008; Ridlatama\u2019s requests for the September 2010 technical consideration letters dated 27 May 2010; evidence of protests to Mr. Noor following the Revocation Decrees; Ridlatama\u2019s SKIPs; Ridlatama\u2019s 29 October 2009 letter to the East Kutai Police; non-confidential documents from Credit Suisse\". R-Comments 1, \u00b6\u00b6 39-44, 52-60, 69-71; R-Answers, \u00b6 142; R-PHB1, \u00b6 107, note 268.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that Article 34(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules empowers it to order the production of evidence, witnesses or experts at any stage of the proceedings. The first sentence of Article 34(3) further states that the Parties \"shall cooperate with the Tribunal\" in the production of such evidence. Pursuant to the second sentence of Article 34(3), the Tribunal \"shall take formal note\" of a Party\u2019s failure to comply with its obligations in this respect and the reasons provided for such failure. Article 34(3) reads as follows:\n\n\"The parties *shall cooperate* with the Tribunal in the production of the evidence and in the other measures provided for in paragraph (2). The Tribunal *shall take formal note* of the failure of a party to comply with its obligations under this paragraph *and of any reasons given for such failure* \" (emphasis added).\n\n248.\n\nAs the Tribunal interprets this provision, it (i) enshrines a general obligation to cooperate, (ii) and therefore does not aim at particular failures to comply with particularized disclosure requirements, (iii) provides for the opportunity, under certain circumstances to excuse non-compliance, such as the invocation of privilege, and (iv) does not necessarily imply specific consequences in cases of non-compliance, such as the drawing of adverse inferences.\n\n249.\n\nExcept where otherwise stated and considering paragraphs 15.3 and 15.9 of PO1 as well as Article 9 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence, the Tribunal comes to its conclusions on the basis of the evidence on record and does not deem it necessary to draw adverse inferences.\n\n250.\n\nThis being so, for greater clarity, the Tribunal adds that it accepts the invocation of privilege by the Respondent in relation to the police files concerning investigations into the alleged forgery, and in relation to documents concerning investigations into Messrs. Ishak and Noor by the anti-corruption agency KPK, since they are covered by the secrecy of criminal investigations. Moreover, considering the evidence given by Mr. Ramadani regarding the (bad) state of the archives at the Regency of East Kutai (and in particular at the Mining and Energy Bureau),383 the Tribunal appreciates the Respondent's difficulties in locating various documents. As concerns the Planology Office maps, while Mr. Ordiansyah seemed to indicate that his office could produce various maps and a digital database,384 the analysis below will show that the Tribunal primarily aimed at determining the authenticity of the disputed documents by focusing on the signatures, and that it was able to reach its conclusion on the basis of the maps on the record.\n\nTr. (Day 4), 145:3-146:3 (Direct, Ramadani).\n\n*See*, for instance: Tr. (Day 3), 150:8-14 and 163:25-164:4 (Cross, Ordiansyah).\n\n251.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not deem it warranted to draw adverse inferences from the fact that the Respondent did not present certain individuals as witnesses. The fact that Mr. Noor did not appear for questioning resulted in discarding his witness statement (see paragraph 84 above). As regards Mr. Putra, the Tribunal notes that he is no longer employed by the Indonesian Government. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants did not request that Messrs. Putra or Aspan be examined, which they could have done by contacting these persons or asking the Tribunal to do so. The same holds true for the fact that the Claimants did not present Messrs. Basrewan and Mazak as witnesses.\n\n**6. Relevance of previous decisions or awards**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling grounds to the contrary, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject always to the text of the BITs and the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.\n\n**B. Factual aspects of document authenticity**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the authenticity of the 34 documents listed in the Document Table. The Tribunal will review the allegations regarding each disputed document in the following section. This review will lead to the conclusion that the signatures in the disputed documents are not authentic and not authorized. For greater clarity, the Tribunal already notes here the essential reasons for such conclusion.\n\n255.\n\nFirst, all the signatures in the disputed documents were mechanically reproduced when the record establishes that officials at the relevant levels of the Government signed documents of such nature by hand. Second, the record shows that the Government did not use autopens or similarly sophisticated mechanical devices to reproduce signatures. Third, the same technology was used to reproduce the disputed signatures in documents allegedly issued at three different levels of the Government.\n\n256.\n\nFourth, the record contains three different versions of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses of 24 May 2007. The first contains identical signatures of Mr. Ishak most likely reproduced through the use of an autopen; the second comprises \"draft decrees\" with coordination initials but without any signature from Mr. Ishak; and the third comprises copied and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak taken from a previous license belonging to PT Ridlatama Power (\"PT RP\"). The existence of these three different versions of the same documents undermines the Claimants\u2019 argument that the application process for the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses was brought to a successful end. It also casts serious doubt on the validity of the other disputed documents. Finally, the circumstances surrounding the ReEnactment Decrees which contain identical signatures of Mr. Noor and were inexplicably issued ten days after the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses further buttress the Respondent\u2019s case of a scheme to forge documents.\n\n257.\n\nSince the Respondent\u2019s allegations primarily rest on the lack of authenticity of the licenses, the Tribunal will first deal with these (2.1) and address the remaining or ancillary documents thereafter (2.2). Last, the Tribunal will ascertain the Parties' involvement in the authorship of the disputed documents (2.3).\n\n**2. Survey and Exploration Licenses**\n--------------------------------------\n\n2.1. **Main features of the disputed documents**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses and the PT IR and PT INP Survey Licenses separately, because they were issued on different dates and because there are three versions of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses which requires a particular analysis. The Tribunal will deal with certain other particular features (such as the signature blocks and the maps) in the course of its analysis, whenever appropriate.\n\na) The PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses\n----------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses (documents nos. 1-2 in the Document Table) were allegedly issued on 24 May 2007 and bear identical signatures of the then-Regent of East Kutai, Mr. Awang Faroek Ishak. There are three versions of decrees in the record for each license, namely (i) the best copies (and originals inspected during the first document inspection of 29 August 2014) of the licenses originally produced by the Claimants (Exh. C-40 and C-41; Exh. P-18 and P-19), bearing a decree number, signatures identical to those on the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses as well as on the four Exploration Licenses, and the official Garuda seal (chop) partly overlapping with the signatures,385 (ii) the draft decrees without the signature of the Regent but bearing coordination initials (Exh. C-383 and C-384) taken from the so-called Kurniawan archive (see paragraph 74 above) and put on the record in June 2015,386 and (iii) decrees, which bear copied and pasted signatures of the Regent taken from the PT RP Survey License issued on 12 February 2007 (Exh. R-264 and R-265; documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table) and provided by Mr. Gunter to the Claimants on 27 July 2015, a few days before the hearing.387\n\nThe original versions of these decrees were inspected by the Parties' forensic experts during the first document inspection on 29 August 2015. *See* : Epstein ER2, Annex 1, items 1-2.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 83-86; Kurniawan WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43. *See* also: Respondent's e-mail of 15 June 2015.\n\nRespondent's e-mail of 30 July 2015; Claimants' e-mail of 30 July 2015; and Tribunal's e-mail of 30 July 2015.\n\n260.\n\nThe first set, i.e. the versions originally filed by the Claimants (Exh. C-40 and C-41), contain four distinct elements, namely (i) a decision letter granting a General Survey License for a period of one year, (ii) an attachment setting out the obligations of the holder of the mining license, (iii) an attachment specifying the coordinates of the mining concession, and (iv) a map indicating the borders of the concession area and applicable land uses. The decision letters contain a letterhead with the emblem of the Regency, bear a decree number, refer to an application letter of PT RTM and PT RTP respectively, and bear the signature of the then-Regent, which partly overlaps with the Garuda seal. The decree numbers are mainly typewritten, except for the first three numbers which were inserted by hand. Similarly, the date is partly written by hand (day) and otherwise typewritten (month and year). The decree number and date are not added to the attachment containing the map.\n\n261.\n\nThe signatures of the then-Regent are affixed at the end of all four elements and they partly overlap with the Garuda seal. It is undisputed that they are all identical.388 The following is an image of the signature block taken from the decision letter in the PT RTM Survey License:389\n\nStrach ER1, Annex B, Charts 1 and 2.\n\nRTM\u2019s KP General Survey License, Decree 210/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 (**Exh. C-40**).\n\n262.\n\nThe following is the signature block taken from the decision letter in the PT RTP Survey License:390\n\nRTP\u2019s KP General Survey License, Decree 211/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 (**Exh. C-41**).\n\n263.\n\nThe map attached to each license in the first set shows the mining area and the different land uses. The legend column contains five different sections: a general description, an inset showing East Kutai, the legend proper, a signature block containing Mr. Ishak's signature partly overlapping with the official Garuda seal, and the designation of the responsible office in the Regency. All entries are in the Bahasa Indonesian language. The Tribunal will revert to specific features of these maps, and in particular to the \"anomalies\" on the basis of which the Respondent argues that these maps \"have the earmarks of having been produced by a trickster\".391\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 63.\n\n264.\n\nThe second set, namely the draft decrees (Exh. C-383 and C-384), were also allegedly issued on 24 May 2007. They also contain the four elements mentioned above in respect of the first set. The decision letter does not contain a decree number and, in contrast to the original licenses, the date is completely handwritten. In addition, the draft decrees are not signed by the Regent but bear the initials of Mr. Putra next to the Regent's typewritten name. Finally, the decision letter contains a box with the coordination initials of Mr. Putra, the then-Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau, Mr. Zainuddin Aspan, the then-Head of the Legal Section, Mr. Idris Yunus, the then-Assistant 1, Mr. Sjafruddin, the then-Regional Secretary, and Mr. Noor, the then-Deputy Regent.392\n\nTr. (Day 5), 6:19-8:8 (Cross, Ramadani). *See* also: Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 83.\n\n265.\n\nThe following image depicts the box with the coordination initials in the PT RTM draft decree next to the space provided for Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature:393\n\nDraft General Survey Business License for RTM, Decree No. 210/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 (**Exh. C-383**).\n\n266.\n\nAnd the following image depicts the box with the coordination initials in the PT RTP draft decree:394\n\nDraft General Survey Business License for RTP, Decree No. 211/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 (**Exh. C-384**).\n\n267.\n\nThe attachment setting out the obligations of the license holder contains a handwritten decree number, a handwritten date, and the initials of Mr. Putra next to the typewritten name of the Regent, but not the signature of the Regent. The attachment setting out the coordinates of the mining concession contains only a handwritten decree number and date. Both elements bear the same decree number as the licenses analyzed above (i.e., 210/02,188.45/KHK/V/2007 for PT RTM and 211/02,188.45/KHK/V/2007 for PT RTP). Finally, the legend column of the map only has the initials of Mr. Putra, next to the typewritten name of the Regent, but not the Regent's signature:395\n\nDraft General Survey Business License for RTP, Decree No. 211/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 (**Exh. C-384**)\n\n268.\n\nFinally, the third set of licenses found in the Gunter Documents also reproduce the content of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, although they show some important differences. First, in addition to the four elements mentioned above, the documents contain a spatial analysis dated 21 May 2007, prepared by the Planology Office of the Regency, specifying the various land uses in the concession area, and signed by Messrs. Ordiansyah and Putra. Second, the decree number and date are always handwritten. Third, the maps are different in significant respects from the ones attached to the documents analyzed above. In particular, the column on the right of the maps does not contain a legend or a box for the Regent's signature, but contains three signatures (of Messrs. Ordiansyah, Putra and Ishak), one identification number (the NIP of Mr. Ordiansyah), and the official Garuda seal partly overlapping with Mr. Ishak's signature. The following image depicts the signature block next to the map in the version of the PT RTM Survey License provided by Mr. Gunter:396\n\nGunter's General Survey License for RTM (**Exh. R-264**).\n\n269.\n\nAnd the following image depicts the signature block next to the map attached to the version of the PT RTP Survey License provided by Mr. Gunter:397\n\nGunter's General Survey License for RTP (**Exh. R-265**).\n\n270.\n\nIt is undisputed that Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature in these documents is identical to his signature in the PT RP Survey License of 12 February 2007,398 which is depicted in the image below.399\n\n*See*, e.g.: Respondent\u2019s e-mail of 30 July 2015.\n\nRP\u2019s KP General Survey License, Decree 53/02,188.45/HK/II/2007, 12 February 2007, p. 2 of Indonesian version (**Exh. ' C-29**). *See* also: Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Slide 29.\n\n271.\n\nThe following image compares Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature in the PT RP license of February 2007 with his signature as it appears in several places of the PT RTM Survey License received from Mr. Gunter:400\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Slides 3 and 42.\n\n272.\n\nThe following two images compare Mr. Ishak's signature in the PT RP license of February 2007 with his signature in various places of the PT RTP Survey License received from Mr. Gunter:401\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, Slides 4-5 and 43-44.\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimants did not dispute the Respondent\u2019s allegation that these signatures were copied and pasted from the PT RP license.402 The forensic experts from both sides conducted their own examinations prior to the hearing and confirmed this fact.403 Indeed, this appears quite clearly from the version of the PT RTP license where some printed text below Mr. Putra\u2019s name is partly cut off by the overlaying signature block containing Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature and the Garuda seal:404\n\nRP\u2019s KP General Survey License, Decree 53/02,188.45/HK/II/2007, 12 February 2007 (**Exh. C-29**).\n\nTr. (Day 2) 55:13-58:10 (Direct, Epstein); Tr.

Image taken from: Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Slide 4. *See* also: Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Slide 45.\n\n274.\n\nSimilarly, the signature block cuts off a portion of the text in the attachment setting out the obligations of the license holder:405\n\nGunter's General Survey License for RTP, p. 2 of Indonesian version (**Exh. R-265**). Image taken from: Respondent's Opening Statement, Slide 46.\n\nb) The PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses\n---------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses (documents nos. 3-4 in the Document Table) were allegedly issued on 29 November 2007, and bear identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (Exh. C-65 and C-66). The originals were inspected by the Parties' forensic experts during the first document inspection on 29 August 2014.\n\n276.\n\nThe main features of these licenses are similar to those of the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses analyzed above, i.e. they contain four distinct elements (decision letter, attachment with obligations of license holder, attachment with coordinates, and map); bear a decree number of which the first numbers are handwritten; refer to the respective application letters of PT INP (20 November 2007) and PT IR (19 November 2007); bear identical signatures of the Regent which partly overlap with the Garuda seal; and bear a date of which the day is handwritten.406\n\nStrach ER1, Annex B, Charts 3-4.\n\n277.\n\nThe following image depicts the signature block of the decision letter in the PT INP Survey License:407\n\nINP\u2019s KP General Survey License, Decree 247/02,188.45/HK/XI/2007, 29 November 2007 (**Exh. C-65**). Color reproduction taken from: Epstein ER2, Exhibit 3. *See* also: Strach ER1, Annex B, Chart 3.\n\n278.\n\nAnd the signature block in the Survey License of PT IR looks as follows:408\n\nIR\u2019s KP General Survey License, Decree 248/02,188.45/HK/XI/2007, 29 November 2007 (**Exh. C-66**). Color reproduction taken from: Epstein ER2, Exhibit 4. *See* also: Strach ER1, Annex B, Chart 4.\n\n279.\n\nA distinctive feature is the difference in the maps compared to those in the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses. The maps in the PT INP and PT IR licenses are not only aligned in a different direction than the legend (not in landscape format), but appear more rudimentary since they do not specify the land uses.409 In addition, the legend column contains an inset showing all of East Kalimantan, whereas the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses show East Kutai. Finally, the legend is mostly in Bahasa Indonesian language, but the word river appears in English.\n\nThe Claimants did not dispute that the maps are copies of those attached to the PT INP and PT IR application letters, specifically the Application for General Survey License made by Investama Resources of 19 November 2007, p. 4 (**Exh. C-54**) and the Application for General Survey License made by Investmine Persada of 20 November 2007, p. 4 (**Exh. C-55**).\n\nc) The Exploration Licenses\n---------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Exploration Licenses of PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR (documents nos. 15-18 in the Document Table) were allegedly issued on 9 March 2008 and bear identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (Exh. C-99 to C-102 and Exh. P-49 to P-52). The originals were inspected by the Parties\u2019 experts during the first document inspection on 29 August 2014.\n\n281.\n\nThe Exploration Licenses also contain four elements, namely the decision letter, an attachment setting out the obligations of the license holder, an attachment with the coordinates of the mining area, and a section with maps. The first two numbers of the decree number and the day of the date were inserted by hand. The signatures of Mr. Ishak partly overlap with the Garuda seal. It is undisputed that the Regent\u2019s signature in all four Exploration Licenses are identical and that they are identical with those in the four Survey Licenses just described that were originally filed by the Claimants.410\n\nStrach ER1, Annex B, Charts 7-13.\n\n282.\n\nThe following is the signature block of the decision letter in the Exploration License of PT RTM:411\n\nRTM KP Exploration License, Decree 37/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-** **102**).\n\n283.\n\nThe following is the signature block of the decision letter in the Exploration License of PT RTP:412\n\nRTP KP Exploration License, Decree 36/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-101**).\n\n284.\n\nThe following is the signature block of the decision letter in the Exploration License of PT INP:413\n\nINP KP Exploration License, Decree 38/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-** **99**).\n\n285.\n\nThe following is the signature block of the decision letter in the Exploration License of PT IR:414\n\nIR KP Exploration License, Decree 39/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-** **100**). Color reproduction taken from: Epstein ER2, Exhibit 16. *See* also: Strach ER1, Annex B, Chart 12, Doc. 16.\n\n286.\n\nIn contrast to the Survey Licenses above, the Exploration Licenses all contain more than one map, each bearing an identical signature of Mr. Ishak. The PT RTM, PT RTP and PT IR Exploration Licenses have three maps, i.e., a situation map, a topographic map and an outcrop map,415 while the PT INP Exploration License has two maps, there being no outcrop map.416 Consequently, the first three Exploration Licenses bear six and the PT INP Exploration License bear five identical signatures of Mr. Ishak.417\n\nRTM KP Exploration License, Decree 37/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-102**) ; RTP KP Exploration License, Decree 36/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-101**) ; IR KP Exploration License, Decree 39/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-100**).\n\nINP KP Exploration License, Decree 38/02,188.45/HK/IV/2008, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-** **99**).\n\n*Id*. *See* also: Strach ER1, Annex B, Charts 7-13.\n\n287.\n\nGeneral features of the maps attached to the Exploration Licenses are, *inter alia*, that the map and legend are in portrait format, the Regent's signature and the official Garuda seal are below and outside the map, all descriptions are in English, and they use different scales, all of which appear to be different from the one employed in the Survey Licenses.418\n\nThe Claimants did not dispute the Respondent's position that the maps are scaled 1:50,000 instead of 1:250,000 (R-Answers, \u00b6 88). The Tribunal notes, however, that the situation maps in the exploration licenses use a different and larger scale than the one in the topographic and outcrop maps.\n\n**2.2. How were the disputed documents signed?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nIt is undisputed that Mr. Ishak did not sign the Survey and Exploration Licenses by hand.419 Indeed, the Claimants did not challenge Mr. Ishak's testimony that he did not sign those decrees.420 More importantly, the experts agree that all the signatures of Mr. Ishak in these eight documents are identical and are therefore reproductions.421 They also agree that the signatures are high quality reproductions.422 On this basis, the Tribunal cannot but find that Mr. Ishak\u2019s signatures in the Survey and Exploration Licenses were not written by hand, that they were affixed on the documents by some other means, and that the reproductions are of high quality.423\n\nThe Claimants stated that they and \"their expert, Dr. Strach, agree with the State and Mr. Epstein that the signatures on the disputed documents cannot be the product of human handwriting as they are, essentially, identical\". Reply, \u00b6 51. *See* also: Strach ER1, \u00b6 7; Tr. (Day 2) 177:6-11 (Cross, Strach).\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 12.\n\nThe Claimants did not challenge the two \"well-established principles\" put forward by Mr. Epstein that (1) no two people write alike and (2) no one person produces a signature or writing in exactly the same way twice (e.g., Epstein ER2, p. 7). Dr. Strach stated as follow: \"These documents contain ink signatures in the name of H. Awang Faroek Ishak which (other than in some very fine detail) are essentially identical to each other. Individually they lack the variation in pen pressure and associated variation in ink line width and impression that is characteristic of handwritten signatures (the ink lines are almost constant width). Collectively their identical nature indicates that they cannot be the product of human handwriting as people cannot and do no replicate their signature exactly from one signature to another\" (Strach ER1, \u00b6 7).\n\nTr. (Day 2), 177:12-14 (Cross, Strach); Tr. (Day 2), 198:7-9 (Tribunal, Strach).\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 11. *See* also, e.g.: Tr. (Day 2), 158:4-160:2 (Cross, Strach).\n\n289.\n\nThe position is less clear-cut when it comes to establishing what technology or method was used to affix Mr. Ishak\u2019s signatures on the disputed licenses. The Parties have different views on this issue and each expert could not fully rule out the position adopted by the other. The Respondent relied on Mr. Epstein\u2019s evidence to argue that the signatures were affixed through an autopen, while the Claimants relied on Dr. Strach, who was inclined to find that the signatures were produced through a high-quality stamping device. The Claimants also relied on evidence given by Mr. Kurniawan who stated that the Regency was using purple color ink stamps to reproduce the signature of Mr. Ishak, for instance, for \"invitations and announcements\".424\n\nKurniawan WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\n290.\n\nIn his second report, having confirmed that Mr. Ishak\u2019s signatures were not written by hand, Mr. Epstein opined that they were the product of a mechanical process referred to as an autopen signature and defined as follows: \"This process uses a master signature that has been programmed into the autopen through a smart card or flash drive. The signature is then reproduced, in ink, exactly the same way each time\".425 Mr. Epstein concluded that one master signature was used to reproduce Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature in all eight licenses.426\n\nEpstein ER2, p. 8.\n\nEpstein ER2, p. 8.\n\n291.\n\nBy contrast, Dr. Strach considered that \"it is not possible to make a definitive or probabilistic determination of the technology or technologies used to produce these signatures\".427 While Dr. Strach conceded that the signatures present some characteristics of an autopen, such as uniform pen pressure, blunt ends and generally smooth appearing lines,428 he indicated that the use of high quality stamp impressions or other types of printing technology \"are other explanations\" of the origin of the disputed signatures.429\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 12.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 8. Dr. Strach also stated that a \"reduced amount of ink was noted at the ends of some ink lines\", further conceding that \"literature indicates that extra ink at the ends of ink lines is sometimes a characteristic of Autopen writing rather than reduced ink\".\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 11.\n\n292.\n\nIn respect of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, in particular, Dr. Strach observed that certain features speak in favor of stamp impressions or other printing processes rather than autopen: specifically an angular feature at the bottom left of the relatively long rounded feature in the lower center part of the signature (marked as E in the reproductions below), a slight downward protuberance near the right end of the lowest almost horizontal line of the signature (marked as D in the reproductions below), the width of a small spot to the left of the signature which is smaller than the main signature ink lines (marked as C in the reproductions below),430 and strings of faint marks near the top right and lower left of the signature (marked as A and B in the reproductions below).431 The following images depict these features in the PT RTM license:432\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 8 and App. C.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 10.\n\nStrach ER1, App. C, Chart 17. Dr. Strach provides the following explanations: \"The repeating fine features associated with many of the signatures on document 1 to 16 are marked C to E [...]. Strings of faint marks that recur with varying degrees of visibility on eight signatures on pages of documents 1 and 2 are marked A and B\".\n\n293.\n\nDr. Strach further noted that the blue ink of the circular stamp impression (i.e., the Garuda seal) is strongly visible on the back of the signature page, suggesting \"substantial soaking\" into the front of the paper, while the signatures present \"less substantial soaking\".433 He also observed that, at the intersection between the stamp and the signature, the blue ink of the stamp impression \"is either not visible or has substantially reduced visibility\", possibly indicating that the stamps were placed on the documents after the signature.434\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 24.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 24 and App. H.\n\n294.\n\nWith respect to the specific features identified by Dr. Strach, Indonesia responded that protuberances, angular features, voids, width variations, small spots and dots, smudge and faint marks are also associated with autopens.435 In particular, Indonesia argued that Dr. Strach failed to explain \"why the marks associated with the signatures always recur in the same position\" and \"why the marks associated with the circular stamp impressions do not\".436\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 44-47.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 48.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that autopens have been commonly used in the United States for several decades, particularly by government agencies, including to reproduce the signature of the President of the United States such as the one of President Eisenhower.437 By contrast, autopens are much less known in other parts of the world, in particular in South-East Asia and Australia.438 Dr. Strach, who practices in Australia, stated that such devices are rare in his country and that he personally had never come across one.439 Although the Claimants dispute the reliability of Indonesia's witnesses on this point, a matter to which the Tribunal will revert, it notes that all the Indonesian witnesses testified that they never heard of autopens and that such devices were not used by the Indonesian authorities, including the Regency of East Kutai, the Governorship of East Kalimantan, and the MEMR.440 It is also noteworthy that there is no indication in the record whether the Autopen company had sold its devices to the Indonesian Government.441\n\n*See* : Stephen Koschal, Andreas Wiemer, *Presidents of the United States, Autopen Guide* (2nd ed., 2011) (**Exh. R-211**). *See* also: Tr. (Day 2), 23:19-24:7 (Direct, Epstein); Tr. (Day 2), 195:24-196:2 (Tribunal, Strach).\n\nDr. Strach stated the following during cross-examination:  \n \"Q. Are autopens utilized in Australia?  \n A. I don't know the answer to that question.  \n Q. But in your 25 years of working as a document examiner, you haven't run across autopen signatures or documents in your work?  \n A. I haven't directly, both in the UK and in Australia\". Tr. (Day 2), 155, 3-8 (Cross, Strach).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*See*, in particular: Ishak WS1, \u00b6 16; Armin WS, \u00b6 27; Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 37; Djalil WS, \u00b6 16. Mr. Ramadani did not explicitly refer to autopens, but stated that the Regency \"never utilizes an electronic signature, stamp or any mechanical or automated method of affixing the Regent's signature\" (Ramadani WS, \u00b6 17). The Tribunal further notes that the Claimants' witness, Mr. Kurniawan, had not either heard of autopens until the present proceedings and that he did not know whether such devices were used at the Regency (Kurniawan WS1, \u00b6 53).\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Epstein testified that he had not enquired whether the Autopen company had sold its machines to the Indonesian Government (Tr. (Day 2), 115:9-13 (Cross, Epstein)). The Claimants do not appear to have made such inquiry either.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Dr. Strach conceded that the signatures on all eight mining licenses are identical in the sense that the same master signature was used.442 While he opined that the signatures in the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses might have been produced through a different technology than the other disputed signatures of Mr. Ishak as Regent, he also admitted that the recurrent spots and features \"rather strongly\" suggest that one single technology was used.443 Dr. Strach further accepted that the uniform pen pressure, the blunt ends, the smooth lines and extra ink at the end of ink lines are characteristic of autopen technology.444 He also could not rule out that a faulty autopen produced the specific features he identified.445 Because the signatures are of such high quality, Dr. Strach ruled out regular stamp impressions, including self-inking stamp impressions, or pre-inked stamps. Asked about self-inking stamp impressions, he answered as follows:\n\n\"Q. Would they fall within what you would call a self-inking or high quality stamp?\n\nA. In terms of the high quality we\u2019re seeing in these particular signatures, it is a bit hard to reconcile what I\u2019m seeing with these signatures with a regular stamp impression, including a self-inking stamp impression\".446\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 11.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 11. Dr. Strach provided the following explanations at the hearing regarding paragraph 11 of his first expert report: \"In that paragraph 11 I\u2019ve put a hypothesis that documents 1 and 2 [in the Document Table above, i.e., the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses] may have been produced using a different technology used for documents 3 to 18 [in the Document Table above], but then I\u2019ve sort of self-criticized that by saying that the recurrent spot which occurs on all these signatures, and the other features referred to, the detail within those signatures, recurs throughout all these signatures, so that rather strongly suggests that the one technology or device has been used\". Tr. (Day 2), 183:4-12 (Cross, Strach). *See* also: Tr. (Day 2), 203:21-22 (Tribunal, Strach).\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 8. At the Hearing, Dr. Strach stated the following with respect to the disputed signatures:  \n \"Q. At the time you examined the documents in Singapore, what were your initial observations concerning the signatures in terms of their quality and what their provenance might be?  \n A. That they were remarkably similar and uniform, many produced with what appeared to be uniform pen pressure. But one of the first things I also observed was some of these extra marks that have gone into the first report\". Tr. (Day 2), 156:7-14 (Cross, Strach). *See* also: Tr. (Day 2), 160:16-21 (Cross, Strach).\n\nTr. (Day 2), 183:1-2, 185:13-23 (Cross, Strach); Tr. (Day 2), 197:16-18 (Tribunal, Strach). *See* also: Strach ER1, \u00b6 22; Strach ER3, \u00b6 12; Strach ER4, \u00b6 4.\n\nTr. (Day 2), 157:18-24 (Cross, Strach).\n\n297.\n\nAnd Dr. Strach also seemed to rule out pre-inked stamps:\n\n\"There are other forms of stamp impressions. Pre-inked stamps, for example, can produce quite reproducible signature images. But again, from what I've seen, not as reproducible as what I'm seeing with these signatures\".447\n\nTr. (Day 2), 158:2-6 (Cross, Strach).\n\n298.\n\nIt is striking that the Claimants' expert was unable to identify any technology able to generate such high quality reproductions, other than autopen devices.448 After counsel for the Claimants suggested during the crossexamination of Mr. Epstein that metallic stamping devices could possibly be the source of these high quality reproductions, counsel for the Respondent put the same possibility to Dr. Strach, who answered that he was unable to identify any such device and that he was unfamiliar with metallic stamping devices. Dr. Strach could not have been clearer:\n\n\"I've not found anything that reproduces the quality of these particular signature reproductions\".449\n\nAnd further:\n\n\"Q. So my question is, as someone who is very familiar with this area [i.e., stamp impressions], can you identify today a high quality stamp that would produce a signature with this quality?\n\nA. I can't specifically state which make of stamp could produce this quality\".450\n\n*See*, e.g.: Tr. (Day 2), 176:25-177:2 (Cross, Strach).\n\nTr. (Day 2), 158:4-160:2 (Cross, Strach). *See* also: Tr. (Day 2), 197:6-8 (Tribunal, Strach).\n\nTr. (Day 2), 158:23-159:2 (Cross, Strach). And Dr. Strach added: \"So, I mean, there are so many varieties of print technology that all such print technologies would have to be considered. And print technology can reproduce in fine detail aspects of an original image, but I can't be more specific as to what technology\". Tr. (Day 2), 163:6-10 (Cross, Strach). *See* also: Tr. (Day 2), 49:18-23 (Direct Epstein).\n\n299.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is of the view that there are insufficient elements in the record to follow Dr. Strach when he sought to discard an autopen signature based on the fine outline marks. Indeed, Indonesia pointed to literature demonstrating that the autopen signatures of U.S. Presidents also contain similar fine detail, including reduced amount of ink at the ends of some ink lines, protuberances, angular features, voids, smudge marks, faint marks, spots and dots, and width variation.451 For instance, the following reproduction of the autopen signature of former President Richard Nixon features protuberances, angular features and voids in the letter R, and smudge or faint marks near the letter N:452\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. The literature referred to by the Respondent states the following: \"There are many reasons why \u2018variants' can be produced from the same matrix. Minute differences will appear from the same pattern when the operator moves the paper or item placed on the Autopen. If the pen is not placed tightly in the machine or when a pen runs out of ink, and a different type of pen replaces the old one a \u2018variant' type of signature will be produced\". Stephen Koschal, Andreas Wiemer, *Presidents of the United States, Autopen Guide* (2nd ed., 2011), p. 8 (**Exh. R-211**).\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 45, referring to Stephen Koschal, Andreas Wiemer, *Presidents of the United States, Autopen Guide* (2nd ed., 2011), p. 34, Autopen Signature of Richard Nixon, # 6 (**Exh. R-211**).\n\n300.\n\nSimilarly, the following two signatures illustrate variants between the autopen signature of former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the second one features additional spots and dots:453\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 47, referring to Stephen Koschal, Andreas Wiemer, *Presidents of the United States, Autopen Guide* (2nd ed., 2011), pp. 16-17, Autopen Signatures of Dwight Eisenhower, ## 6 and 7.a-variant (**Exh. R-211**).\n\n301.\n\nFinally, when assessing the weight of expert evidence, the Tribunal also takes into consideration the knowledge and experience of each expert. While Mr. Epstein\u2019s second report identified an autopen as the source of the disputed signatures, Dr. Strach had no prior expertise in autopens and did not conduct research into autopens.454 In contrast, Mr. Epstein was confronted throughout his career with autopens, in particular as the Chief Forensic Document Examiner at the Forensic Document Laboratory of the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the United States of America between 1980 and 2000. In that capacity, he regularly reviewed fraudulent signatures that should have been generated by autopens but were instead signed by hand. **455** It is true that he has not kept up with developments in the autopen technology since he left the U.S. Immigration Service. In light of his experience and expertise and considering that there appear to have been no new developments, this is not susceptible of affecting the weight of this evidence. Indeed, Dr. Strach confirmed that most of the scientific literature on autopen was \"definitely older\", meaning pre-dating the year 2000.456\n\nDr. Strach stated the following during cross-examination:  \n \"Q.[\u2026] did you perform any field research, if you will, to talk to people in the industry?  \n A. The autopen industry? No, I didn't.  \n Q. Did you conduct any tests of autopens to see how autopens functioned?  \n A. No, I've never had access to an autopen machine.  \n Q. Have you seen an autopen machine?  \n A. Well, you asked that before. No, I haven't physically seen - I've seen online images of autopens and moving images of autopen devices working.  \n Q. Do you know how they actually operate?  \n A. Not in precise detail [\u2026]\". Tr. (Day 2), 154:12-24 (Cross, Strach). *See* also: Tr. (Day 2), 196:3-13 (Tribunal, Strach).\n\nMr. Epstein's experience as forensic document examiner dates back to 1967. Tr. (Day 2), 21:17-24:15 (Direct, Epstein); Epstein ER1, p. 8.\n\nTr. (Day 2), 161:20-22 (Cross, Strach).\n\n302.\n\nIn sum, on the basis of the facts and evidence in the record and having assessed the weight of the expert evidence before it, the Tribunal gives the preference to Mr. Epstein's expert opinion according to which Mr. Ishak's disputed signatures on the Licenses were most likely reproduced by an autopen or similarly sophisticated devices. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal is mindful that Mr. Epstein indicated a 70% probability that an autopen had been used and that, therefore, no 100% certainty can be asserted.457 Yet, having pondered all the circumstances, the Tribunal has no hesitation concluding in favor of the view of the Respondent\u2019s expert, which it finds clearly more reliable and robust than the evidence of the Claimants\u2019 expert.\n\nTr. (Day 2), 124:10-18 (Tribunal, Epstein). Mr. Epstein did not exclude the possibility of a fine stamp, although he could not identify any technology able to reproduce such high quality impressions. Tr. (Day 2), 114:18-23 (Cross, Epstein). The Tribunal further notes the following statement of Dr. Strach at the hearing: \"Here I have a bit of an inclination one way, but I'm not comfortable saying that it's probably not an autopen\". Tr. (Day 2), 183:1-2 (Cross, Strach).\n\n**2.3. Was the signature of the disputed licenses in Mr. Ishak\u2019s name authorized?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s primary case that forgery is established by the very fact that the disputed licenses were not signed by hand. Therefore, so Indonesia contends, the question does not even arise whether there was authority to mechanically reproduce Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature. In any event, the Respondent relies on witness evidence to argue that there was no such authority. It also submits that the elements of process highlighted by the Claimants do not support a finding of authorization.\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimants argue that authorization is the key question in the present context. For them, the record shows that the application process for the Survey and Exploration Licenses was brought to a successful end, and that Mr. Ishak authorized the issuance of the licenses and the mechanical reproduction of his signature (good faith authorization). In the alternative, the Claimants submit that someone within the Regency (possibly Mr. Putra and/or Mr. Noor) conspired to generate fake or \"plausibly deniable\" licenses in order to preserve the possibility of auctioning off the mining area in favor of a higher bidder once mining deposits would be discovered (bad faith authorization). In particular, the Claimants argue that Mr. Noor was playing off Ridlatama against the Nusantara companies, and vice-versa, so as to obtain the best bargain from the highest bidder for the vast newly discovered coal reserves.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the practice of signing mining licenses by hand (a) and then review whether the signature of such licenses in the Regent\u2019s name was authorized (b), including the elements of process invoked by the Claimants to support their contention that there was authorization (c).\n\na) The practice of signing mining licenses by hand\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nMr. Ishak gave evidence that, as Regent of East Kutai, he always signed decrees by hand, and that he did not authorize anyone to sign the disputed licenses in his stead.458 Mr. Armin, member of the staff of the Licensing Subdivision of the Mining and Energy Bureau,459 and Mr. Ordiansyah, Head of the Planology Office,460 confirmed that Mr. Ishak always signed decrees by hand. They also testified that the Regency did not use mechanical devices to reproduce the Regent's signature.461\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.\n\nMr. Armin joined the Mining and Energy Bureau of the East Kutai Regency in 2004, as staff of the Licensing Subdivision of the General Mining Division. He was appointed Head of the Licensing Subdivision in 2013. Armin WS, \u00b6 5.\n\nMr. Ordiansyah joined the Directorate of Geographic Information System (\"SIG\") of the Information System Agency of the East Kutai Regency in 2001. From 2006 to 2007, he was the Acting Head of Spatial Layout and Land Utilization Bureau at the Regional Development Planning Board, as well as the coordinator of the SIG. He was appointed on 30 May 2007 as Head of the Planology Office, which took over the functions and databases of the SIG. Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 9.\n\nArmin WS, \u00b6 27; Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 37. Although at the relevant time (between 2007 and 2008), Mr. Ramadani was working as a lawyer in the Legal Assistance Subdivision of the Legal Section of the Regency Secretariat and dealing mainly with disputes rather than with the approval process for decrees (he only became Head of the Legal Section in 2012), he too gave evidence that the \"Regent would sign the originals [i.e., the three versions of final draft decrees of each mining license] by hand\". He further stated that the Regency \"never utilizes an electronic signature, stamp or any mechanical or automated method of affixing the Regent's signature\". Ramadani WS, \u00b6 17. With respect to signature stamps, *see* also: Tr. (Day 4), 147:1-5 (Direct, Ramadani).\n\n307.\n\nIn his witness statements, Mr. Ishak referred to the \"Regulation of Minister of Domestic Affairs Number 3 Year 2005\", which provides that Regency documents must be signed by the Regent or a duly authorized official,462 and testified that: \"[m]y understanding, and the understanding of all other officials with whom I have dealt in my capacity as Regent of East Kutai, has always been that this regulation requires official documents to be signed by hand\".463\n\nArticle 8 reads as follows: \"An Official Document in the Sphere of Regency/Municipality Governments shall be signed by Regent/Mayor, Deputy Regent/Deputy Mayor, Head/Deputy of People's Legislative Council as well as official in the Sphere of Regency/Municipality Governments which is authorized [to sign]\". Regulation of Minister of Domestic Affairs Number 3 Year 2005, concerning Governance Guidelines of Official Document in Regency/Municipality Governments (**Exh. RLA-158**).\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 13.\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimants' witnesses Benjamin and Gunter also stressed the importance of signing mining licenses by hand. Mr. Benjamin said that he would have been \"concerned\" had he known that the mining licenses were not signed by hand.464 Mr. Gunter, for his part, called the signature the \"last bastion of power\".465 Questioned by the Tribunal, he responded that \"a physical signature is [...] the only way it would happen\":\n\n\"Q. In your experience, and what I see from your GMT you have lots of experience in Indonesia, in this type of licensing, have you ever seen a license signed by a Bupati, or another official, not in handwriting but by a stamp or some other means?\n\nA. Unfortunately, I only deal with photocopies [\u2026] But I know that a signature, a physical signature is, I would think would be the only way it would happen. I\u2019ve never heard of stamps being used and I\u2019ve never heard of any other reproduction techniques used by the Bupati himself, because he is presented with a document for signing\".466\n\nTr. (Day 7), 97:1-19 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 35:11 (Cross, Gunter).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 57:20-58:8 (Tribunal, Gunter).\n\n309.\n\nThe evidence of Mr. Ishak, Regent of East Kutai at the relevant time and presently Governor of East Kalimantan, deserves a mention. While he was clear on the fact that he signed documents by hand, he appeared at times confused about dates and chronology of events during his crossexamination. For instance, he first stated that \"at the [relevant] time I was not the Regent\" and thereafter that \"[t]here must have been something that might have prevented me from signing\" the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses.467 The Tribunal does not consider that this diminishes the value of this evidence on his signing practice. That evidence is largely corroborated by other witnesses as just described. Moreover, it is recalled that Mr. Ishak attended the hearing while still recovering from a stroke, which may explain his difficulties of situating himself in time and remembering details.468\n\nTr. (Day 3), 15:15 and 16:2-3 (Direct, Ishak). *See* also: C-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\nTr. (Day 3), 17:15-16 (Direct, Ishak). At times, Mr. Ishak also had difficulty remembering the dates of his different offices, stating at one point that he \"withdrew from being Regent in 2003, while the licensing and permit was only processed in 2008, if I\u2019m not mistaken\", and then later on when confronted with the draft decrees for PT RTM and PT RTP: \"How is it possible that - wait a second - 24 May 2007, I signed the document? Because at the time I was not the Regent. That would be impossible. I was already governor. How would it be possible for me to sign a decree based on my position as a Regent?\" Tr. (Day 3), 12:6-8, 15:13-18 (Direct, Ishak). According to the information provided in Mr. Ishak\u2019s first witness statement, he was Regent of East Kutai for a first term between 1999 and 2003 and for a second term between late 2005 and December 2008, when he was elected Governor of East Kalimantan for a first term. He was reelected for the 2013-2018 term and presently still holds that office. Ishak WS1, \u00b6 6.\n\nb) The scope of delegated authority to issue decrees\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nSince the licenses bear Mr. Ishak's signature and it is established that Mr. Ishak signed documents by hand, the question arises whether Mr. Ishak authorized someone to sign his name in his stead.\n\n311.\n\nIt is common ground that duly authorized officials at the Regency could sign official documents. It is also common ground that, during Mr. Ishak's absence, his deputy, Mr. Noor, would sign official documents such as mining licenses. In this context, the Claimants point to Mr. Ishak's frequent travels during his campaign for the position of Governor of East Kalimantan between 2006 and 2008.\n\n312.\n\nNothing in the record shows that Mr. Noor, as Deputy Regent, would have signed on behalf of Mr. Ishak using Mr. Ishak's name and signature. Mr. Ishak was clear that Mr. Noor was only authorized to sign official documents using his own signature:\n\n\"Q. The question is not what he did. The question is whether he had the authority to sign. [Unclear - simultaneous speaking]\n\nA. He had the authority as deputy, yes, he could.\n\nQ. How would he sign? Would he sign \"Isran Noor\" or would he sign something else?\n\nA. As Deputy Regent. As Deputy Regent.\n\nQ. He would sign his name?\n\nA. As Deputy Regent, Isran Noor.\n\nQ. He would not have authority to sign your name?\n\nA. Not possible. Not possible\".469\n\nTr. (Day 3), 83:23-84:8 (Tribunal, Ishak).\n\n313.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the Tribunal specifically asked the Parties what evidence showed that the issuance of the impugned documents was authorized or not.470 The Claimants put forward the following elements: (i) Mr. Ishak authorized his subordinates to sign official documents on his behalf, in particular when he was away campaigning for the Governorship of East Kalimantan between 2006 and December 2008; (ii) his deputy at the time, Mr. Noor, was \"automatically responsible\" during his absence to look after the affairs of the Regency and Mr. Noor had authority to make and sign decrees; (iii) although Mr. Ishak testified that Mr. Noor would sign as Deputy Regent, Isran Noor, \"the scope of Mr. Noor\u2019s authority as Deputy Regent is not clear\",471 especially since Mr. Ishak was evasive on that point; and that therefore (iv) \"it seems possible that, in his second term as Regent (which included the Relevant Period), Mr. Ishak was more preoccupied with his campaign than serving as Regent, and that he delegated a significant amount of authority to Mr. Noor\"; or (v) that Mr. Noor exceeded his delegated authority \"when he saw opportunities for personal gain\", which would explain his wealth and estrangement from Mr. Ishak.472\n\nProcedural Order No. 20, \u00b6 6(d).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45; C-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45. *See* also: C-PHB2, \u00b6 18.\n\n314.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, none of these elements show that Mr. Ishak authorized Mr. Noor to issue official documents by reproducing Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature or that Mr. Noor exceeded his delegated authority, by affixing Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature on the disputed documents. While Mr. Ishak may well often have been away on his election campaign, the record does not show that he was absent at the relevant time, i.e. on 24 May 2007 for the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, on 29 November 2007 for the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses, and on 9 April 2008 for the Exploration Licenses. More importantly, the Tribunal sees no reason to doubt Mr. Ishak\u2019s testimony that, during his absence, Mr. Noor would sign official documents using his own name, not that of Mr. Ishak. There is also nothing in the record suggesting that, in respect of the disputed PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, Mr. Noor exceeded his authority by mechanically reproducing Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature. The only evidence in the record showing Mr. Noor\u2019s involvement with the disputed PT RTM and PT RTP licenses are his initials affixed, in his capacity as Deputy Regent, in the last line of the coordination box on the draft decrees (see image in paragraphs 265 and 266 above). If anything, this would show that he used his own name or initials rather than the Regent\u2019s. The Tribunal notes in this context that the initials of Mr. Putra, not Mr. Noor, appear next to the printed name of Mr. Ishak (see image in paragraph 267 above).\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimants invited the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from the fact that the Respondent only produced 22 mining licenses issued in 2007 and 2008. According to the Claimants, \"it is impossible to confirm whether Mr. Ishak regularly authorized his subordinates to issue decrees on his behalf, but the adverse inference to be drawn is that, if these documents were produced, they would indicate that such a procedure was common at the Regency\".473 The Tribunal is unable to draw such adverse inference in the absence of any indication that Mr. Noor would mechanically reproduce Mr. Ishak's signature instead of signing decrees on behalf of the Regent.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 45, note 146.\n\n316.\n\nIn fact, the experts concur that all the licenses produced by the Respondent for purposes of comparison bear non-identical handwritten signatures of Mr. Ishak, as opposed to identical mechanically reproduced signatures such as the ones at issue here. There are two exceptions, however, namely two licenses granted to a company by the name of Swasembada, which is controlled by Ridlatama, a fact to which the Tribunal will revert (see paragraphs 363-364).474 Dr. Strach examined a total of 2,849 pair comparisons of Mr. Ishak's signature (both on originals and copies) and came to the conclusion that \"[n]o further examples of repeating signatures were found in the numerous pair comparisons I have made\".475\n\nStrach ER2, \u00b6 7.\n\nStrach ER2, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.\n\nc) Elements of process\n----------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimants rely on several elements of process both predating and postdating the issuance of the licenses to support the contention that the licenses were issued with proper authorization. These include the Ridlatama applications for mining licenses, staff analyses prepared by the Mining and Energy Bureau, spatial analyses prepared by the Planology Office, draft decrees with coordination initials, register books, actual survey and exploration activities on the ground, compliance with reporting obligations, dead rent payments, various acknowledgments of receipt, and other subsequent conduct of Indonesian officials.476\n\n*See*, e.g., Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 79-90.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal will primarily focus on the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, since most of the allegations and evidence of process relate to these licenses. Thereafter, it will review the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses and the Exploration Licenses. In view of the fact that the same master signature of Mr. Ishak was employed in all cases, a finding of authorization (or lack thereof) with respect to the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses is likely to apply equally to the other disputed licenses. Before turning to the elements of the licensing process invoked by the Claimants, it is useful to set out the main steps of such process.\n\n(i) The licensing procedure in the Regency of East Kutai\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nA mining application is usually submitted to the Regent, with a copy to the Mining and Energy Bureau, or directly to the Mining and Energy Bureau, in which case it will forward the application to the Regent. A mining application addressed to the Regent is first received by the General Affairs Bureau,477 which Mr. Ramadani accepted to describe as the Regency\u2019s mailroom managing the \"circulation of destination of letters\".478 The General Affairs Bureau registers the incoming letter in the register book479 and then forwards it to the Regent,480 without, however, opening the letter.481 The General Affairs Bureau only provides a stamped receipt if the applicant so requests.482\n\nTr. (Day 4), 154:1-10 (Cross, Ramadani).\n\nTr. (Day 4), 157:10 (Tribunal, Ramadani). Mr Armin specified that if the application was addressed to the Mining and Energy Bureau, it would forward the application to the Regent \"for his instruction (*disposisi*)\". Armin WS, \u00b6 10.\n\nTr. (Day 4), 159:6-13 (Cross, Ramadani); Ramadani WS, \u00b6 13.\n\nTr. (Day 4), 156:1-9 (Tribunal, Ramadani).\n\nTr. (Day 4), 157:20-158:5 (Tribunal, Ramadani).\n\nTr. (Day 4), 155:8-25 (Tribunal, Ramadani).\n\n320.\n\nUpon receipt of the application, the Regent writes by hand his instructions (*disposisi* in Indonesian) on the application for the attention of the Mining and Energy Bureau.483 The Head of the Licensing Subdivision of the Mining and Energy Bureau reviews the documentation accompanying the application and coordinates with the Planology Office to verify, through a spatial analysis, any potential overlap with preexisting mining areas and the specific land uses in the area for which the license is applied.484\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 9. Mr. Armin provided the following details: \"Upon receipt of the application and the Regent\u2019s instruction (*disposisi*), which is usually hand-written on the application itself (it is rarely contained in a separate letter)\". Armin WS, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12.\n\nArmin WS, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 15.\n\n321.\n\nA staff analysis by the Mining and Energy Bureau is prepared if a specific issue requires the Regent\u2019s attention.485 If there is no such issue and the application fulfills all the requirements, the Licensing Subdivision of the Mining and Energy Bureau prepares a draft decree,486 while the Planology Office issues a new map that is initialed by the Head of the Planology Office.487 The draft decree is then passed on to the Legal Section.\n\nArmin WS, \u00b6 16.\n\nTr. (Day 5), 2:9-13 (Cross, Ramadani); Ramadani WS, \u00b6 15. *See* also: Armin WS, \u00b6 16.\n\nFor instance, Mr. Ordiansyah provided the following explanations with respect to instructions of the Regent to generate a map: \"Q. So you said you will develop a new map when the license is granted? A. Yes, if the Regent gave me an order to do that. After our input on the spatial matters, the Regent gives an order whether or not we should follow up on the issuance of the permit. If it is issued, it means that we will develop a new map, where there is a column for the Regent, and I just provide my initials. Q. When you say an order from the Regent, do you mean a disposisi, you will have to receive a disposisi from the Regent to then produce the map? A. Yes. If I'm ordered to do that and have a disposisi to issue the license\". Tr. (Day 3), 134:1-15 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n322.\n\nTogether with the application and related documents, the draft decree is received by the Head of the Legal Section, who passes it on to the Laws and Regulations Subdivision.488 The latter reviews the legal aspects of the draft decree.489 If the draft is approved and finalized (dated and numbered), the Head of the Laws and Regulations Subdivision prepares \"several originals as required and/or necessary\".490 Mr. Ramadani actually explained that this office prepares three originals. The last page of the decision letter or decree of the first original contains a box for the coordination initials of various departments within the Regency,491 and is ultimately kept in the archives of the Legal Section.492 The Secretariat of the Mining and Energy Bureau registers the receipt of the remaining two originals and keeps one of them in the archives of the Mining and Energy Bureau.493 The third original is delivered to the applicant.494\n\nTr. (Day 5), 2:14-20 (Cross, Ramadani).\n\nTr. (Day 4), 161:23-162:4 (Cross, Ramadani). When asked whether the Legal Assistance Subdivision was at all involved, Mr. Ramadani answered that it could be involved, if the draft decree \"related to matters that have been handled by legal assistance subdivision as the lawyer of the regional government\". Tr. (Day 4), 162:5- 1 4 (Cross, Ramadani). In this context, Mr. Ramadani explained that the Legal Section comprises three subdivisions, the Legal Documentation Subdivision, the Laws and Regulations Subdivision and the Legal Assistance Subdivision (Ramadani WS, \u00b6 11; Tr. (Day 4), 159:25-160:8 (Cross, Ramadani)).\n\nTr. (Day 5), 3:24-4:8 (Cross, Ramadani). *See* also: Armin WS, \u00b6 17.\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 10. *See* also: Armin WS, \u00b6 17.\n\nTr.

Once the heads of all these departments have approved the decree by affixing their initials in the coordination box, the three originals are presented to the Regent who signs them, starting with the first original which contains the coordination box. Mr. Ramadani provided the following descriptions of this particular process in this respect:\n\n\"After all the coordination initials are complete, then Mr. Aji Rahida, as head of the laws and regulations subdivision, would directly bring the three bundles to the Regent for signing. The coordination initials is on the top. Therefore, if the Regent signs a documents [sic], the first one which is signed by the Regent is the coordination initials, then the second original then the third original. It would be that way\".496\n\nTr. (Day 5), 5:1-6 (Cross, Ramadani).\n\nTr. (Day 5), 9:22-10:6 (Cross, Ramadani).\n\n324.\n\nFollowing signature by the Regent, the three originals are returned to the Legal Section where they are stamped with the official Garuda seal.497 The decree is then entered in the register book of the Legal Section.498 Finally, the third original is handed over to the successful applicant by an official of the Regency, but not by way of an official handover ceremony where the Regent is present.499\n\nTr. (Day 5), 9:14-10:10 (Cross, Ramadani). Mr. Ramadani gave evidence that the Legal Section keeps two Garuda seals, one at the Laws and Regulation Subdivision and the other at the Documentation Subdivision. Tr.

(Day 5), 9:9-13 (Cross, Ramadani). Contrary to Mr. Quinlivan\u2019s testimony that Mr. Ishak delivered the Survey and Exploration Licenses to Mr. Kurniawan during official handover ceremonies, Mr. Kurniawan stated that Ridlatama officials collected these licenses from the Mining and Energy Bureau.

Churchill and Planet finally invoke a letter sent by the Mining and Energy Bureau to PT RTM and PT RTP \"\u2018welcoming' them to East Kutai and inviting them to coordinate with relevant government agencies\".505\n\n*See*, e.g., Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 79-88.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90 and Extracts from the 2007 register book of the Legal Section of the Regency of East Kutai (**Exh.

C-52** Resubmitted).\n\n327.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of these elements demonstrate that the impugned PT RTM and PT RTP licenses were authorized. In particular, the Respondent relies on evidence given by Messrs. Ordiansyah and Armin that they never processed the general survey applications of PT RTM and PT RTP, since the requested mining areas overlapped with the mining licenses of the companies Nusantara Wahau Coal and Kaltim Nusantara Coal.506 For Indonesia, the spatial analyses prepared by Mr. Ordiansyah supports this conclusion, considering that the abbreviation \" *Eks.* \" preceding the names of the Ridlatama companies means *eksplorasi*, or exploration, and does not mean \"former\" as the Claimants erroneously argue (see also paragraph 335 below).507\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 30; Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 26; Armin WS, \u00b6 21; Tr. (Day 3), 144:4-14 (Direct, Ordiansyah); Tr. (Day 4), 131:12-132:5 (Tribunal, Armin).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 30; Tr. (Day 3), 136:8-17 (Direct, Ordiansyah) and 173:1-175:10 (Cross, Ordiansyah).\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the applications for the Survey Licenses of PT RTM and PT RTP were processed within the Regency and reached the penultimate stage in the process, all the relevant departments having approved the licenses. This being so, for the following main reasons, these facts do not prove that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were affixed on the disputed licenses with his approval.\n\n329.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the most relevant elements of process in this context are the 26 February 2007 staff analysis, the 21 May 2007 spatial analyses, and the three versions of licenses in the record. The *staff analysis dated 26 February 2007* was prepared by the then-Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau, Mr. Djaja Putra.508 It analyzes whether the concession areas requested by PT RTM and PT RTP overlap with the mining areas conceded to Nusantara and reaches the following conclusions: (i) the concession areas requested by PT RTM and PT RTP overlap to 100% with \"previous\" locations of the mining areas of the two Nusantara companies KNC and NWC, respectively;509 (ii) the KNC and NWC exploration licenses expired on 9 March 2006;510 (iii) Nusantara sent its first requests for extensions on 20 November 2006 which were received on 29 November 2006;511 and (iv) the Nusantara extension applications were \"eight months and 26 days late from the expiry of the IUP which is 7 March 2006\".512 On that basis, Mr. Putra reached the conclusion that the KNC and NWC licenses had \"expired\", that \"the concession areas become open to other companies\", and that the Regent had \"the authority to make any decisions on locations\".513\n\nStaff Analysis from the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau at the Regency of East Kutai, 26 February 2007 (**Exh. C-34**).\n\n*Id*., items A.1 and B.1.\n\n*Id*., items A.2.d and B.2.d.\n\n*Id*., items A.2.e and B.2.e.\n\n*Id*., items A.2.g and B.2.g.\n\n*Id*., p. 2.\n\n330.\n\nAssuming the content of the staff analysis to be correct, the latter only shows that the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau did assess potential overlaps of the requested mining areas with other concessions. His assessment supports the Claimants\u2019 contention that the mining areas in question were \"open\" at the relevant time and that they could apply for a mining license. It does not show that Mr. Ishak\u2019s non-handwritten signature on the decrees was authorized. It does so even less if one considers that the staff analysis specified that the ultimate decision to grant a mining license rested with the Regent. Moreover, there is no indication in the analysis that Mr. Putra coordinated his analysis with Mr. Ordiansyah from the Planology Office (at the time called the Geographic Information System), which coordination was necessary to verify the existence of potential overlaps. In fact, Mr. Armin, the staff member in the Licensing Subdivision of the Mining and Energy Bureau who was in charge of processing the Ridlatama applications,514 gave evidence that he was not involved in the preparation of the staff analysis, and was unable to find the original or a copy of this analysis.515 In addition, the staff analysis does not contain any instructions (*disposisi*) from the Regent, and Mr. Ishak denied having seen this analysis.516\n\nArmin WS, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nArmin WS, \u00b6 22.\n\nMr. Ishak stated: \"I do not recall receiving that Staff Analysis when I was Regent. I also note that the 26 February 2007 Staff Analysis does not have my instruction (*disposisi*) for the relevant bureau to follow up [\u2026]\". Ishak WS1, \u00b6 26. *See* also: Tr. (Day 3), 104:16-21, 107:25-108:2 (Cross, Ishak).\n\n331.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent questioned the fact that the Claimants were in possession of an internal Regency document. Messrs. Benjamin and Kurniawan testified that Regency officials routinely shared internal documents with applicants in order to keep them informed about the progress of this application. Hence, the Tribunal attaches no particular significance to this point.517\n\nBenjamin WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40; Kurniawan WS1, \u00b6 40.\n\n332.\n\nAs a last point in respect of the staff analysis, the Respondent argued that its reference to the MEMR letter of 23 March 2007 casts doubt on the reliability of the staff analysis which is dated from 26 February 2007. While there may be explanations,518 it is true that this discrepancy is odd. However, the Tribunal does not see what can be inferred from this oddity for present purposes.\n\nFor instance, a clerical error in the date of the staff analysis, which could date from 26 March 2007 instead of 26 February 2007.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the *spatial analyses of 24 May 2007* prepared by the Head of the Planology Office, Mr. Ordiansyah. These analyses were prepared in respect of the PT RTM and PT RTP applications and are attached to the versions of such licenses contained in the Gunter Documents.519 Mr. Ordiansyah explained that a spatial analysis is an internal document drawn up for the Regent and the Mining and Energy Bureau, which always consists of a table and a map.520 The table contains five columns that determine (i) the status of the forest area, (ii) the status of the land, (iii) the forest concessions, (iv) the location of permits for plantation, and (v) the location of mining permits.521 Mr. Ordiansyah further specified that the map is not the one that is ultimately attached to a mining license, when an application is ultimately approved by the Regent.522\n\nGunter's General Survey License for RTM (**Exh. R-264**) ; Gunter's General Survey License for RTP (**Exh. R-265**).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 131:13-17, 131:24-132:1 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 128:11-129:3 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\nTr. (Day 3) 128:18-23 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n334.\n\nMr. Ordiansyah confirmed at the hearing that he had prepared the analyses. In these documents, he concluded that the mining areas for which PT RTM and PT RTP had applied overlapped with the exploration licenses of the two Nusantara companies KNC and NWC.523 These two spatial analyses are signed by Mr. Ordiansyah, Head of the Planology Office, and Mr. Putra, Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau.524\n\n*See*, with respect to PT RTP: Tr. (Day 3) 135:25-136:7 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n**Exh. R-264, R-265**. *See* also: Tr. (Day 3), 128:7-10 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n335.\n\nMr. Ordiansyah pointed in particular to the abbreviation *\"Eks\"* (with a dot) which precedes the names of the Nusantara companies (see also paragraph 327 above). He explained that \" *Eks.* \" was the abbreviation used by the Planology Office to signal the existence of an exploration license. He added that an abbreviation was needed because \"the column is so small\".525 By contrast, the Claimants understand \" *Eks* \" as meaning \"former\" in reliance on a Bahasa Indonesian dictionary definition without corroborating evidence of actual practice. Faced with these two meanings, the Tribunal is inclined to accept Mr. Ordiansyah\u2019s explanation that the term \" *Eks.* \" within the Planology Office was used as an abbreviation for exploration. The spatial analyses therefore confirm Mr. Ordiansyah\u2019s evidence that \"[d]ue to the overlapping issue, the Planology Office never issued any maps for RTM [and] RTP [\u2026] as we understood that general survey licenses would not be approved for those Ridlatama companies\".526\n\nMr. Ordiansyah provided the following explanation: \"Q. So is that correct if I say the \u2018Eks.\u2019 stands for \u2018eksplorasi\u2019; that\u2019s what you are saying? A. Yes, it\u2019s because the column is so small and we cannot write down the full word, so we tried to abbreviate it, \u2018exploration\u2019, in accordance with the latest status of PT Nusantara Wahau Coal whose license we have in our database. So - it\u2019s because the column is too small and won\u2019t fit if I wrote down that entire word. So there is a dot there, and that means that it is an abbreviation of the work \u2018eksplorasi\u2019\". Tr. (Day 3), 136:8-17 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\nOrdiansyah WS, \u00b6 26.\n\n336.\n\nIn contrast to the table in the spatial analyses which, in addition to the signature of the Head of the Planology Office, is co-signed by the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau, Mr. Ordiansyah gave evidence that only the Head of the Planology Office was supposed to sign the map attached to a spatial analysis.527 He therefore signified his perplexity when seeing that the signatures of both Mr. Putra and Mr. Ishak appeared on the maps of his spatial analyses.528 It should be mentioned here that the signatures of Mr. Ishak are copy-pasted from another document, i.e. the PT RP General Survey License of 12 February 2007 (see paragraphs 268-270 above).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 132:6-9 (Direct, Ordiansyah). Mr. Ordiansyah further stated that \"this is my analysis and only I can sign it, and there will not be a signature of the head of mining bureau and the Regent\u2019s signature. So this is solely my report, the result of our analysis for the Regent; so if it is from me, there shouldn\u2019t be a signature from the head of the mining bureau as well as the Regent\". Tr. (Day 3), 132:15-22 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 133:1-11, 137:1-12 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n337.\n\nMr. Ordiansyah further expressed his skepticism about the fact that the spatial analyses had been provided to the Ridlatama companies and the Claimants. Mr. Ordiansyah explained that a new map is generated within the Planology Office if the Regent decides to approve a mining application, which map would then be attached to the original licenses:\n\n\"After the analysis has been submitted to the Regent and carbon copied to the head of mining bureau, then there will be an order from the Regent, whether or not it will be followed upon the form of license, then we will make another map for license\".529\n\nTr. (Day 3), 133:20-25 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that he prepared the maps attached to the two spatial analyses in the Gunter Documents.530 The Tribunal has no reason to question Mr. Ordiansyah's evidence that only the Head of the Planology Office was meant to sign these maps. Accordingly, the fact that these maps additionally bear the signatures of Messrs. Ishak and Putra and that Mr. Ishak's signatures are copied and pasted tends to show that these maps were doctored.\n\nMr. Ordiansyah stated the following: \"So this map, if [sic] from our side, from my office, planology office, and together with the table, only I can sign the map. You can see my signature there. And that is the one that I sent to the mining bureau and the Regent's office. Only my signature will be there, because this is an analysis and it is part of my duties - the one that is responsible for the spatial matters to the Regent. And I sent it to the mining bureau and also to the office of the Regent\". Tr. (Day 3), 132:1-10 (Direct, Ordiansyah).\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the *three versions of mining licenses* PT RTM and PT RTP, namely (i) the Survey Licenses which bear identical signatures of the Regent affixed, as was seen earlier, by an autopen or other similarly sophisticated mechanical device (see paragraph 302 above),531 (ii) the so-called draft decrees provided by Mr. Kurniawan, which bear no signature of the Regent,532 and (iii) the Gunter Documents, which bear identical signatures of the Regent that were copied and pasted from the PT RP mining license of 12 February 2007.533\n\nDocuments nos. 1-2 in the Document Table.\n\nDraft General Survey Business License for PT RTM, Decree No. 210/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 (**Exh. C-383)** ; Draft General Survey Business License for PT RTP, Decree No. 211/02,188.45/HK/V/2007, 24 May 2007 **(Exh. C-384**).\n\nDocuments nos. 33-34 in the Document Table. *See* also: General Survey Business License for Ridlatama Power, Decree No. 53/02,188.45/HK/II/2007, 12 February 2007 (**Exh. C-29**).\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal is troubled by the co-existence of these three different versions of the same licenses for which no cogent explanation is offered. It is true that Mr. Gunter stated that he frequently saw different versions of the same licenses. However, his statement did not extend to circumstances like the present, where none of the licenses contain a handwritten signature of the Regent. He indeed confirmed that he assumed that his documents contained the handwritten signature of the Regent (something he could not verify since Mr. Mazak from Churchill only provided him photocopies).534\n\nTr. (Day 7), 23:1-24:3 (Cross, Gunter). *See* also: Gunter WS, \u00b6 65.\n\n341.\n\nFurther, as was discussed in connection with the approval process, Mr. Ramadani explained that, once the first original license with the coordination box is returned to the Legal Section, the Regent is presented with three originals. He signs all three starting with the first original containing the coordination box. In the draft decrees provided by Mr. Kurniawan, the coordination boxes do appear but they feature no signature of the Regent. Next to the latter\u2019s printed name, one only finds the initials of Mr. Putra. If Mr. Ishak had authorized the reproduction of his signature, the process was such that it would first have been applied to the first original.\n\n342.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Armin, who had worked on the Ridlatama applications of PT RP and PT Ridlatama Steel (\"PT RS\"), gave evidence that he did not prepare the draft decrees.535 Similarly, Mr. Ordiansyah indicated that the maps attached to the draft decrees were not issued or approved by the Planology Office.536\n\nTr. (Day 4), 68:11-16, 69:7 (Direct, Armin).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 144:2 (Direct, Armin). *See* also: R-PHB1, \u00b6 34.\n\n343.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants\u2019 explanation that these draft decrees were provided to Ridlatama to verify the coordinates of the mining area is not convincing. The Tribunal does not question the Claimants\u2019 statement that internal documents of the Regency were provided to Ridlatama staff. What is questionable, however, is the fact that the draft decrees are dated 24 May 2007, the day when the disputed licenses were supposedly signed by the Regent. It is implausible that the following steps all occurred on the same day: (i) the issuance of draft decrees, (ii) their unofficial transmittal to Ridlatama staff to verify the coordinates of the mining areas, and (iii) the formal signing of the original mining licenses, which would normally occur once the verification was completed. The Tribunal also notes that Mr. Benjamin stated that he had no knowledge of these draft decrees, and had never seen them prior to the hearing.537\n\nTr. (Day 7), 106:9-21 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\n344.\n\nAs a further troubling aspect, the forensic experts confirmed that the signatures of Mr. Ishak in the Gunter Documents were copied and pasted from the PT RP license of 12 February 2007.538 The Gunter Documents also comprise the spatial analyses of Mr. Ordiansyah mentioned above. These include maps with copied and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak, as well as the signature of Mr. Putra, when Mr. Ordiansyah explained that none of these signatures should be there in a normal process.\n\nTr. (Day 2), 55:13-58:10 (Direct, Epstein); Tr. (Day 2), 180:9-18 (Cross, Strach), 194:12-15 (Tribunal, Strach).\n\n345.\n\nAdditionally, the originals inspected by the forensic experts of both Parties show additional troubling oddities. In particular, the maps attached to the disputed PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses do not contain Mr. Ordiansyah's initials; they are not registered in the database of the *Sistem Informasi Geografis* (which was the former name of the Planology Office); and they are not in the format of the 2007 official maps of the Regency (Mr. Ordiansyah pointed in particular to the absence of graticules on all four sides of the map).539\n\nOrdiansyah WS, Annex, items 1-2.\n\n346.\n\nIn other words, the existence of three different versions of licenses casts serious doubt on the authenticity of the licenses on which the Claimants now seek to rely. To these considerations one must add the evidence of Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah, who testified that they never processed the mining license applications of PT RTM and PT RTP, except for Mr. Ordiansyah's spatial analyses concluding that the mining areas overlapped with Nusantara's exploration licenses.\n\n347.\n\nTo summarize, if the approval process had been completed, there would have been two original decrees within the Regency (the first original in the archives of the Legal Section and the second original in the archives of the Mining and Energy Bureau). The third original would have been provided to the applicant. In the present case, the Respondent stated that it could not find the two originals in its archives, be it in the Legal Section or the Mining and Energy Bureau. More importantly, the Claimants should be in possession of only one original of each license, when they produced three different versions. The first versions (the Gunter Documents) contain copied and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak, and are therefore clearly doctored; the second versions contain the signature of Mr. Ishak most likely reproduced with an autopen; and the third versions containing the coordination box show no signature of Mr. Ishak. These elements, together with other oddities identified in the three versions, lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses are not authentic, and that their issuance was not authorized.\n\n348.\n\nIn contrast to the elements of process assessed above, the Tribunal does not attach much importance to the PT RTM and PT RTP *mining application letters*, since they merely show that Ridlatama started the application process. That said, the Tribunal notes that the application letters bear the date of 27 February 2007, while the disputed licenses refer to application letters of 20 March 2007.540 The Tribunal further notes that the coordinates for the applied mining areas do not completely overlap with those set out in the mining licenses.541 Finally, the Tribunal also notes that the application letters do not bear any instructions (*disposisi*) from the Regent.542\n\nCompare the PT RTP and PT RTM applications for General Survey Licenses dated 23 February 2007 (**Exh. C-32, C-33**) with the disputed General Survey Licenses dated 24 May 2007, p. 1 (**Exh. C-40, C-41**).\n\n*Id.,* p. 4 (Indonesian version) (**Exh. C-40, C-41**).\n\nThe Tribunal draws nothing from this observation, since these may be copies of the applications as they were filed by Ridlatama with the Regency.\n\n349.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal does not attribute much relevance to the *MEMR letter of 23 March 2007*. This letter was sent to Ridlatama in response to a request dated 20 March 2007 for a confirmation of the availability of a general survey concession area. In that letter, the MEMR indicated that the status of the mining area contemplated by the two Ridlatama companies would become \"open\" and could be applied for \"if the Concession Area of Exploration held by PT. Nusantara Kaltim Coal of PT. Nusantara Wahau Coal has expired, and no extension [has been] requested by them\".543 It therefore does not support an interpretation that the mining areas in question were open at the relevant time. For present purposes, it merely shows that Ridlatama was interested in obtaining mining rights in the EKCP, but it is otherwise irrelevant to the assessment of whether the disputed licenses were issued with authorization or not.\n\nLetter of 23 March 2007 of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (**Exh. C-37**).\n\n350.\n\nThe fact that the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses were registered in the *Register Book of the Legal Section* does not change the Tribunal\u2019s assessment. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that \"[r]egistration of fictitious or falsified documents does not make them authentic\".544 In any event, the Tribunal cannot follow the Claimants' argument that registration \"points very strongly to the affixation of the Bupati signature and the stamp was authorized\".545 In this regard, Mr. Ramadani testified that the registrar told him that Mr. Putra requested the registration, and that he promised that he would thereafter deliver the signed original license with the coordination box. While the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this evidence is \"aged hearsay\", it is a plausible explanation that would rather confirm that the disputed licenses were not signed.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 43.\n\nThe Claimants stated the following: \"I would put most weight on the register, that if there is a document that is recorded in the register on the Regency, even though we can't answer how and who, one can nevertheless conclude that in all the circumstances, the circumstantial evidence points very strongly to the affixation of the Bupati signature and the stamp was authorized\". Tr. (Day 7), 175:11-18 (Closing, Sheppard).\n\n351.\n\nNeither does the *subsequent conduct* of Indonesian officials change the Tribunal's assessment of the facts. This is particularly so with respect to the ancillary documents whose authenticity is also disputed by the Respondent and which contain signatures identical to the ones in the disputed licenses, such as the payment letters, for instance. The acknowledgements of receipt by different government agencies at various levels are equally incapable of rendering the mining licenses authentic, since they were issued on the (presumably misguided) assumption that the licenses were authentic.\n\n352.\n\nFinally, the Parties extensively argued whether the coordinates of the areas granted in the disputed mining licenses overlapped with the mining areas of two Nusantara companies. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to delve into this issue in any detail, since it is immaterial to resolve the issue of document authenticity, that is the question whether the signatures in the disputed licenses were affixed with authorization or not. Even assuming, *arguendo*, that the Nusantara licenses had expired at the relevant time and that the mining area called EKCP was \"open\" and available for other applicants such as Ridlatama, this would still provide no convincing proof that the disputed documents are authentic. At any rate, as will be seen further below, the disputed PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses created an overlap with two mining areas of another Indonesian company named Bara Energi Makmur (\"BEM\"), a fact which the Claimants did not address at all in their submissions and therefore further undermines their case.\n\n353.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the disputed Survey Licenses of PT RTM and PT RTP are not authentic, and that Mr. Ishak did not authorize the reproduction of his signature through mechanical means.\n\n(iii) The PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses\n------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nIn light of the fact that the disputed PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses (documents nos. 3-4 in the Document Table) contain the same signatures of Mr. Ishak as the ones reproduced in the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, the analysis conducted and the conclusions reached above apply equally here. To reach this conclusion in the present context, the Tribunal reviewed the following additional elements.\n\n355.\n\nFirst, there is nearly no paper trail regarding the application process of these licenses. The application letter of PT INP is dated 20 November 2007 and that of PT IR 19 November 2007. The Survey Licenses were allegedly issued on 29 November 2007. There is no evidence of any staff analysis or spatial analyses, and Mr. Ramadani stated that he did not locate the originals in the archives of the Legal Section. Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah indicated that they never processed any aspect of these applications.\n\n356.\n\nSecond, the maps attached to the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses were not generated by the Planology Office, but were copied and pasted from the application letters.546 In addition, these maps were not signed by hand by Mr. Ishak but contain the same disputed signature of Mr. Ishak that appears on the other challenged licenses.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 37; R-Answers, pp. 32, 34-35.\n\n357.\n\nThird, Mr. Ramadani indicated that the decree numbers on the licenses pertain to other decrees issued in June 2007 and confirmed that the maps are not registered in the Planology Office\u2019s database and do not comport with the format of the 2007 official maps.547 In addition, the Respondent pointed to the fact that the licenses were only registered on 28 December 2007 in the Register Book of the Legal Section and with a different decree number.548 The Respondent further explained that the \"improper registration\" of these two licenses \"cannot be chalked up to incompetence or mere mistake\", since \"[t]heir decree numbers did not correspond at all to the registration entries and the date of registration (28 December 2007) was more than a month after their supposed issuance (29 November 2007)\".549\n\nRamadani WS, Annex, item 4.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 81; R-PHB2, note 56. The decree number of the PT INP license is 247/02,188.45/HK/XI/2007, but it is registered under the number 753/02,188.45/HK/XII/07; and the decree number of the PT IR license is 248/02,188.45/HK/XI/2007 and registered under the number 754/02,188.45/HK/XII/07. *See* : Registration of General Survey Licenses for INP and IR in the 2007 Registration Book of the Legal Section of the Regency of East Kutai, p. 3 (**Exh. C-456**).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 42.\n\n358.\n\nFourth and importantly, the mining areas allegedly granted to PT INP and PT IR in November 2007 partly overlap with the mining area of the company BEM, which obtained its Exploration License in October 2007.550 Therefore, the disputed licenses created an overlap with existing licenses that had been issued shortly before. The Claimants focused on the partial overlap of the PT INP and PT IR mining areas with those of the Nusantara companies BNK and NWC, but kept silent on the BEM licenses. The lack of plausible explanation for this overlap is an additional element pointing towards a fraud.\n\nDecree of Regent of East Kutai concerning Mining Undertaking License for Exploration of PT Bara Energi Makmur dated 31 October 2007 (**Exh. R-171**). *See* also: R-Comments 1, \u00b6 66.\n\n359.\n\nOn this basis and taking into account the main features of the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses described above (see paragraphs 275-279), the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the licenses under scrutiny are not authentic and that the reproduction of Mr. Ishak's signature was not authorized.\n\n(iv) The Exploration Licenses\n-----------------------------\n\n360.\n\nFor essentially the same reasons, the Tribunal also reaches the conclusion that the signatures of Mr. Ishak in the disputed Ridlatama Exploration Licenses of 9 April 2008 (documents nos. 15-18 in the Document Table) were mechanically reproduced without his authorization.551 Indeed, the four Exploration Licenses bear the same non-handwritten signature of Mr. Ishak.552 This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Exploration Licenses were not registered in the register book of the Legal Section and that there is no paper trail at all regarding the application process.553\n\n**Exh. C-99 to C-102**.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 7.\n\nLegal Section Register Book 2008 (**Exh. C-479(b)**). *See* further: Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 99-101; C-PHB1, \u00b6 48; R-Answers, \u00b6 156; R-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 106(2); R-PHB2, \u00b6 20(1).\n\n361.\n\nIn addition, it is noteworthy that the Exploration Licenses contain three different maps generated by GMT (a situation map, a topographic map and an outcrops map), instead of a single map prepared by the Planology Office.554 In this context, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Gunter stated that the maps attached to the Exploration Licenses were generated by Mr. Harahap, who was the supervisor of GIS systems at GMT. Mr. Gunter further testified that never before had he seen GMT maps being attached to mining licenses:\n\n\"Q. Just to make sure we understand your answer, you have not seen it before that your maps are attached to permits issued by the Regency? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\n\nA. Yes, that\u2019s correct. Our maps may be used as a support to the application, but should not normally [be] included [in] a kabupaten [i.e. Regency] document\".555\n\nR-Answers, p. 45; R-PHB1, \u00b6 38.\n\nTr. (Day 7), 52:14-20 (Tribunal, Gunter).\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent called attention to the following other oddities in these maps: they were compiled on 11 June 2007 and are copyrighted; they do not show forestry areas; the legends are in English, instead of Bahasa Indonesian; the Regent\u2019s signature is located outside the maps, instead of inside the legend column; the graticules are only on two sides instead of all four; the maps are improperly oriented in portrait format instead of landscape format; there is an inset of East Kalimantan although maps from 2008 did not have insets; the source of the maps is different from the source of official Regency maps produced by the Respondent; and they are in a different scale (1:50000 instead of 1:250000).556\n\nR-Answers, pp. 42-48, \u00b6 88 and Images 10-11.\n\n363.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the disputed signature of Mr. Ishak that appears on the Exploration Licenses is also reproduced on the mining licenses granted on the same day to two other companies, namely Swasembada Energy and Swasebada Bara.557 In this connection, the Claimants argue that \"[t]he existence of identical signatures on mining licenses granted to unrelated parties on the same day\" supports the Claimants\u2019 view that \"the method of application of the signatures on Ridlatama's Exploration Licenses was not irregular\".558 The Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants' contention, because the Swasembada companies are related to Ridlatama. Indeed, Mr. Mujiantoro, the Managing Director of the four Ridlatama companies under scrutiny here, is a shareholder and director of the two Swasembada companies.559\n\nMining Undertaking License for General Survey of PT Swasembada Energy, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-512**) ; Mining Undertaking License for General Survey of PT Swasembada Bara, 9 April 2008 (**Exh. C-513**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 111.\n\nThe Respondent further pointed out that Mr. Wirmantoro was also a director of PT IR, while at the same time being shareholder and director of the two Swasembada companies. R-Answers, \u00b6 94. *See* also: Company Data - PT Swasembada Energy (**Exh. R-215**) ; Company Data - PT Swasembada Bara (**Exh. R-216**).\n\n364.\n\nTaking into consideration that no other third party mining licenses in the record contain the same non-handwritten signature of Mr. Ishak, the fact that the two Swasembada companies are related to Ridlatama, that the Swasembada licenses were allegedly issued on the same day as the disputed Exploration Licenses, and that they contain the same identical signatures of Mr. Ishak, the Tribunal finds that these are further significant elements corroborating that the reproduction of Mr. Ishak's signature was not authorized.\n\n365.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that the reproduction of identical signatures appearing in the disputed mining licenses was not authorized by Mr. Ishak and that therefore these licenses are not authentic, the Tribunal now turns to the authenticity of the remaining disputed documents, namely the ancillary documents.\n\n2.4. The ancillary documents\n----------------------------\n\n366.\n\nThe ancillary documents contain disputed signatures issued at three levels of the Indonesian Government, the Regency of East Kutai, the Province of East Kalimantan, and the central Government in Jakarta. More specifically, the ancillary documents comprise: (i) the Payment Letters issued at the Regency level (see from paragraph 369 below); (ii) the Cooperation and Legality Letters issued at the Regency level (see from paragraph 369 below); (iii) the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations issued at the provincial level (see from paragraph 383 below); (iv) the Technical Considerations issued by the MEMR at the level of the central government (see from paragraph 409 below); and finally (v) the Re-Enactment Decrees issued at the Regency level (see from paragraph 427 below).\n\n367.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants did not address these documents during the hearing in the same detail as the others. They observed, however, that if the Tribunal were to find that the mining licenses were validly issued \"then the style of signature that one finds in the ancillary documents, was very likely authorized as well\".560 They also confirmed that the reverse would be equally applicable:\n\n\"Q. If we find that those documents here which are called ancillary documents were forged, that we may then also conclude that the survey license and the exploration license are also forged?\n\n[...]\n\nA. [I]f you felt that the same style of signature, that however it was affixed, had been affixed by a forger, without authorization on the ancillary documents, that would be a factor that you might give serious consideration to when you came back to look at the licenses. And the reality is that that is an argument that is made against us. They are the same signatures, and you have heard the evidence of Bupati Ishak, something you obviously have to give some weight to [\u2026]\".561\n\nTr. (Day 1), 154:5-13 (Opening, Sheppard). During Closing Statements, counsel for the Claimants similarly stated the following: \"If we then turn to the ancillary documents. These are not relied on as establishing the claimants\u2019 rights, but they are relied on by the respondent as evidence of a fraudulent scheme. There are the requests for seriousness bond payments, the certification letters, the certificates of legality. I don\u2019t have time to go through those in the same detail, and indeed there is not the same amount of evidence for and against in relation to them. If you find that the general survey licenses and the exploration licenses were validly issued, then it\u2019s very likely that these documents were validly authorized as well\". Tr. (Day 7), 185:17-186:4 (Closing, Sheppard).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 186:7-187:24 (Tribunal, Sheppard).\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal will first assess the authenticity of the documents issued at the Regency level (a), followed by those at provincial level (b) and at the level of the central Government (c). Finally, it will turn to the Re-Enactment Decrees (d).\n\na) Ancillary documents at the Regency level\n-------------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nThe ancillary documents bearing the signature of Mr. Ishak as Regent comprise the Payment Letters, Cooperation Letters and Legality Letters. After briefly setting out the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal sets out the main features of these disputed documents and concludes on their authenticity.\n\n(i) Parties' positions\n----------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the forged documents also include (i) two Payment Letters dated 4 December 2007 for PT INP and PT IR;562 (ii) four Cooperation Letters dated 8 April 2008 for PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR;563 and (iii) four Legality Letters dated 8 April 2008 for PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR.564\n\nLetter from the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 11 March 2015, p. 5.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 26(i).\n\nApplication, \u00b6 26(ii).\n\n371.\n\nThe Respondent pointed to the following evidence of forgery. First, Mr. Ishak did not sign the documents \"or otherwise authorize them\".565 Second, none of these documents are entered into the Regency Registration Books of Decrees.566 Third, none contain a unique decree number.567 Fourth, Mr. Ishak testified that he never issued any Payment or Legality Letters.568 Fifth, Ridlatama created these ancillary documents \"to appease Claimants\", in particular because the Legality Letters \"were needed because of the cooperation agreements\", as the Claimants admitted.569\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 52, item 1.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 52, item 2.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 52, item 2.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 52, item 3; Ishak WS1, \u00b6 20; Ishak WS2, \u00b6 11; Tr. (Day 3), 23:4-10 (Cross, Ishak).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 52, item 4, referring to: Tr. (Day 1), 155:10-11 (Opening Statement of Mr. Sheppard).\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimants reply that there is necessarily less evidence of authorization because the ancillary documents are not licenses.570 With respect to the Payment Letters, the Claimants submit that the \"main evidence\" that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were authorized is that they also bear the official Garuda seal.571 Since the Respondent did not provide the original of the register book of the Legal Section, the Claimants further argue that \"it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether the payment request letters were recorded or not\".572 With respect to the Legality and Cooperation Letters, the Claimants call attention to the fact that the Respondent failed to produce comparator documents, and thus invite the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference from that failure. More specifically, the Claimants stress that these letters bear the official Garuda seal, and that the Legality Letters \"were received and acknowledged a total of 38 times by three levels of government\".573\n\n*See*, for instance: C-PHB1, \u00b6 51.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 47.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 47.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 51.\n\n(ii) Main features of the disputed documents\n--------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nWith respect to the Payment Letters (documents nos. 5-6 in the Document Table), the Respondent disputes the authenticity of the letter dated 4 December 2007, with decree number 173/02,188.45/XII/2007, requesting from PT IR the payment of \"provisioning of territory\", a fixed contribution of general survey and a seriousness security.574 The Respondent also challenges the authenticity of another letter of 4 December 2007, with decree number 174/02,188.45/XII/2007, requesting the same payments from PT INP.575 Both these letters are on letterhead with the emblem of the Regency of East Kutai with the date just below that letterhead. They bear the signature of Mr. Ishak, which partly overlaps with the official Garuda seal. The following depicts the signature in the PT IR Payment Letter:576\n\n**Exh. C-92**.\n\n**Exh. C-93**.\n\nImage taken from: Strach ER4, Annex A, p. 8.\n\n374.\n\nAnd the following shows the signature in the PT INP Payment Letter:577\n\nImage taken from: Strach ER4, Annex A, p. 9.\n\n375.\n\nThe Legality Letters (documents nos. 11-14 in the Document Table) addressed to the four Ridlatama companies are dated 8 April 2008. They refer to letters sent by Ridlatama of 12 February 2008 requesting certificates of legality. They are all on letterhead with the emblem of the Regency, bear a decree number, a date below the letterhead, and the signature of Mr. Ishak partly overlapping with the official Garuda seal.\n\n376.\n\nFinally, the Cooperation Letters (documents nos. 7-10 in the Document Table) are also dated 8 April 2008 and refer to the Ridlatama application letters of 14 February 2008 regarding the implementation of cooperation between the four Ridlatama companies and PT ICD, the local investment vehicle of the Claimants.578 It is noteworthy that the letterhead does not show the emblem of the Regency, and that the date is not below the letterhead but above the signature of Mr. Ishak. They contain a decree number. The signature of Mr. Ishak again overlaps with the official Garuda seal.\n\n**Exh. C-350 to C-353**.\n\n(iii) Assessment\n----------------\n\n377.\n\nFor essentially the same reasons as for the mining licenses, the Tribunal is of the view that the reproduction of Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature was not authorized.\n\n378.\n\nFirst, similar to their findings on the disputed mining licenses (see above paragraphs 288-302), both forensic experts agree that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were not handwritten. They further agree that they are high quality reproductions. The experts also agree that the signatures are identical and were reproduced using the master signature for the mining licenses. The Tribunal has therefore no hesitation to find that these signatures were reproduced with the same device as the signatures on the mining licenses.\n\n379.\n\nSecond, Mr. Ishak confirmed that he never signed or authorized his signature to be placed on these documents.579 More specifically, he stressed that he never issued any payment letters or legality letters:580 \"While I was Regent, I never provided instructions to mining companies to pay a seriousness bond or other payment obligation in a mining area. The holder of a mining license is under an obligation to comply with any payment obligations. The Regent does not separately instruct them to comply with these obligations\".581 This was corroborated by the Claimants' witness, Mr. Benjamin, who stated that payment letters were usually sent by the Mining and Energy Bureau, and that he never saw such letters being issued by the Regent.582\n\nIshak WS2, \u00b6 10.\n\nIshak WS1, \u00b6 20; Ishak WS2, \u00b6 11; Tr. (Day 3), 23:4-10 (Cross, Ishak). *See* also: R-PHB1, \u00b6 52, item 3.\n\nIshak WS2, \u00b6 11.\n\nTr. (Day 7), 109:10-24 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\n380.\n\nThe record indeed contains payment letters signed by Mr. Putra, the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau,583 thus confirming the evidence above. There is no explanation why the Regent himself would have sent similar requests to Ridlatama. In addition, the Payment Letters of 4 December 2007 are not registered in the Registration Book of Decrees and the entries for that date show a different sequence of decree numbers.584\n\n*See*, for instance: Letter dated 3 March 2008 from the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau of the Regency of East Kutai to PT INP and PT IR regarding Payment of Provisioning of Territory Fixed Contribution and Capability Security, pp. 2-3 (**Exh. C-** **92**).\n\nThe decree numbers of the Payment Letters addressed to PT INP and PT IR are 173/02,188.45/XII/2007 and 174/02,188.45/XII/2007, respectively. The Registration Book of Decrees shows for the date of 4 December 2007 a numbering sequence going from 659/02,188.45/HK/XII/07 to 674/02,188.45/HK/XII/07. Furthermore, the Respondent provided a photograph of page containing a \"large blank space\" around 4 December 2007, confirming that there were no entries other than the numbers 655 to 658, which otherwise do not correspond to the numbers of the impugned payment letters. *See* : R-PHB2, note 56 and Annex B, p. 3; Resubmitted Pages from Regency Registration Book of Decrees - 4 December 2007 (**Exh. C-478**).\n\n381.\n\nThird, the oddities described above, in particular the fact that the Cooperation and Legality Letters issued on the same date by the same Regent's office use different letterheads, buttress the finding that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were not placed on these documents with his authorization.\n\n382.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the ancillary documents at the Regency level, namely the Payment Letters of 4 December 2007, the Cooperation Letters of 8 April 2008 and the Legality Letters of 8 April 2008, are not authentic. Mr. Ishak did not sign them nor authorize anyone to place his signature on them.\n\nb) Ancillary documents at the level of the Province of East Kalimantan\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nThe ancillary documents bearing Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature when he was Governor of East Kalimantan are constituted of six Borrow-for-Use Recommendations, two of December 2009585 and four of March 2010.586\n\nDocuments nos. 19-20 in the Document Table.\n\nDocuments nos. 21-24 in the Document Table.\n\n(i) Parties\u2019 positions\n----------------------\n\n384.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a borrow-for-use permit must be obtained from the Ministry of Forestry if a mining area falls within a production forest area.587 The related application for a mining area in East Kutai must include a recommendation letter from the Governor of the Province of East Kalimantan and a technical consideration letter from the Director General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal of the MEMR.588\n\nR-Comments 1, \u00b6 12. *See* also: Nurohmah WS1, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 21; Ordiansyah WS, \u00b6 22; Sianipar WS, \u00b6 22.\n\nR-Comments 1, \u00b6 12. *See* also: Nurohmah WS2, \u00b6 8. *See* further: Regulation of the Minister of Forestry No. P.43/Menhut-II/2008, dated 10 July 2008 concerning Guidelines on Borrow-for-Use of Forest Area, Article 9(4)(c), (h) (**Exh. RLA-167**).\n\n385.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent signals that the Ridlatama companies submitted two sets of applications to the Ministry of Forestry. The first was filed on 9 September 2009, and did not contain any recommendation letter from the Governor or a technical consideration from the Director General at the MEMR.589 The second was filed in March 2010 with copies of the March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations, but without technical consideration letters.590\n\nR-Comments 1, \u00b6 20; Nurohmah WS1, \u00b6 13; Nurohmah WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 14.\n\nR-Comments 1, \u00b6 21; Nurohmah WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14.\n\n386.\n\nFor the Respondent, the March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations are forged, since they contain identical signatures of Mr. Ishak. The Respondent also points to two other Borrow-for-Use Recommendations dated 29 December 2009, which are essentially identical to the March 2010 letters, and which, too, contain forged signatures of Mr. Ishak.\n\n387.\n\nThe Respondent sees the following indications of forgery. First, Mr. Ishak testified that he did not sign or authorize that his signature be affixed on these documents.591 Second, Mr. Epstein determined that the signatures in these documents are identical, that they were reproduced using the same master signature, different from the one used to reproduce the disputed documents analyzed above and issued at the Regency level, and that they are the product of an autopen.592 Third, the additional strokes next to the signature are another indication that Mr. Ishak did not sign these documents, since they are \"more consistent with the behavior of a person forging a signature than an official properly utilizing \u2018high quality stamp impressions'\".593 Fourth, the December 2009 and March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations are \"essentially identical\",594 and Ms. Nurohmah stated that there is no copy of the 2009 Recommendations in the archives of the Directorate of Utilization of Forest Area in the Ministry of Forestry.595\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 1; Ishak WS1, \u00b6 15.\n\nEpstein ER2.\n\nR-Answers, \u00b6 50.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 2.\n\nNurohmah WS2, \u00b6 7.\n\n388.\n\nFor the Claimants, the recommendation letters are not forged. The Claimants' witness, Mr. Benjamin, stated that Churchill and PT ICD requested that Ridlatama apply for borrow-for-use permits \"out of any [sic] abundance of caution\".596 The Claimants note that the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations bear the seal of the Governor of East Kalimantan.597 In addition, they argue that Mr. Epstein's failure to address additional ink strokes added at the end of the signature lines, and which Dr. Strach addressed in his reports, \"casts doubt on the reliability\" of Mr. Epstein's methods and his conclusion that the signatures are the product of an autopen.598\n\nBenjamin WS1, \u00b6 131.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\nReply, \u00b6 63.\n\n389.\n\nThe Claimants believe that there are two possible explanations for the identical signatures on these documents. First, \"officials at a number of levels within the Indonesian government used some form of mechanical process to apply signatures to documents\", thus supporting the Claimants\u2019 good faith authorization theory.599 Second, these documents are the product of a \"scam\" orchestrated within the Regency \"as a means of making Ridlatama think they were progressing\".600 This would have been possible, so say the Claimants, because Regency officials had access to a master signature of Mr. Ishak, since many documents issued by the Governor\u2019s office were copied to the Regency.601\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53, referring to: Tr. (Day 5), 70:13-24 (Cross, Setiawan).\n\n(ii) Main features of the disputed documents\n--------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe December 2009 and March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations relate to the applications for the Ridlatama companies for borrow-for-use permits. Two recommendation letters dated 29 December 2009 concern PT RTM and PT RTP.602 Two further letters dated 11 March 2010 were issued in respect of PT INP and PT IR.603 In addition, two letters concerning PT RTM and PT RTP are dated 22 March 2010.604\n\nRecommendation No. 522.21/5213/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of Forestry, dated 29 November 2009, regarding Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (**Exh. R-144**) ; Recommendation No. 522.21/5214/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of Forestry, dated 29 November 2009, regarding Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Powerindo (**Exh. R-145**).\n\nRecommendation No. 522.21/3193/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Mininster of Forestry, dated 11 March 2010, regarding Forest Area Lease in the name of PT Investment Nusa Persada (**Exh. C-220**) ; Recommendation No. 522.21/3192/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Mininster of Forestry, dated 11 March 2010, regarding Forest Area Lease in the name of PT Investama Resources (**Exh. C-220**).\n\nRecommendation No. 522.21/3219/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Mininster of Forestry, dated 22 March 2010, regarding Forest Area Lease in the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (**Exh. C-220**) ; Recommendation No. 522.21/3217/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Mininster of Forestry, dated 22 March 2010, regarding Forest Area Lease in the name of PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (**Exh. C-220**).\n\n391.\n\nThe 29 December 2009 recommendation letter in connection to PT RTM contains the letterhead with the emblem of the Governorship on the first page. The decree number and the date are below the letterhead, and are partly inscribed by hand. The signature of Mr. Ishak is found on the last page; it partly overlaps with the official seal of the Governorship. The following image depicts the disputed signature:\n\n392.\n\nThe same features characterize the 29 December 2009 recommendation letter with respect to PT RTP. The following image depicts the disputed signature in that letter:\n\n393.\n\nThe 11 March 2010 recommendation letters regarding PT INP and PT IR also show the same main characteristics. The following image depicts the disputed signature in the letter concerning PT INP:\n\n394.\n\nAnd the following image reproduces the disputed signature in the letter concerning PT IR:\n\n395.\n\nThe 22 March 2010 recommendation letters in respect of PT RTM and PT RTP have the same main characteristics. The following image shows the signature in the letter concerning PT RTM:\n\n396.\n\nAnd the following image depicts the signature in the letter concerning PT RTP:605\n\nImage taken from: Strach ER4, Annex A.\n\n(iii) Assessment\n----------------\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both experts agree that these signatures were not handwritten, and are the product of some mechanical reproduction. They also agree that the signatures are essentially identical to each other, but differ from the signatures of Mr. Ishak in the licenses and ancillary documents dating from the time when Mr. Ishak was Regent of East Kutai.606 But while Mr. Epstein concluded that the signatures are the product of an autopen, Dr. Strach expressed the view that \"a machine driven fluid ink pen would be unlikely to replicate such fine detail\", signaling the greater width variation of the main ink lines of the signatures and some edge detail, small spots and smudge marks that are replicated on the signatures of the March recommendation letters.607\n\nStrach ER1, p. 4.\n\nStrach ER1, p. 5.\n\n398.\n\nThe following image depicts the fine detail identified by Dr. Strach in the March 2010 recommendation letters:608\n\nStrach ER1, Annex D. Dr. Strach provides the following explanations: \"The repeating fine features (except where obscured by text) associated with the signature lines on documents 17 to 20 are marked A, B, C and E. The repeating spot is marked D on each signature image. Smudge marks adjacent to the signature on document 20 (only) are marked F\".\n\n399.\n\nDr. Strach further called attention to the presence of several ink lines added to the ends of the \"lowest, almost horizontal strokes of the signatures, and which are not identical in form to each other and are in a different ink than the one appearing on the rest of the signature\".609 The following images show the added strokes on the March 2010 recommendation letters compiled by Dr. Strach:610\n\nStrach ER1, p. 5.\n\nStrach ER1, Annex E. Dr. Strach provides the following explanations: \"The added ink lines occur at the left and right extremities of the lowest almost horizontal features of the signatures on documents 17, 19 and 20 and the right extremity only of this feature of the signature on document 18\". *See* also: Strach ER1, \u00b6 15.\n\n400.\n\nAccording to Dr. Strach, the smoothness of the slight curves and tapered ends suggests that these strokes were written with \"some fluency\" (to the exception of the left side of the signature on document 19 (in the image above) \"which appears to have been written more hesitantly (from its nonsmooth shape)\".611 For the expert, these additional strokes suggest \"a degree of attention to fine detail in the final appearance of the signatures\". He was, however, unable to assess whether these strokes support a finding that the signatures are authentic. At any rate, Dr. Strach opines that these strokes put into question Mr. Epstein\u2019s view that the signatures were produced using an autopen.612\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 16.\n\nDr. Strach stated that Mr. Epstein\u2019s \"definitive determination of the use of Autopen technology becomes more questionable particularly in regard to these four signatures which contain small handwritten additional strokes\". Strach ER1, \u00b6 19.\n\n401.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 experts also inspected the two 29 December 2009 recommendation letters. Specifically, they inspected the original of the letter concerning PT RTP and only a copy of the letter concerning PT RTM.613 Mr. Epstein here again concluded in favor of an autopen.614 He also added that these two signatures \"are from the same Autopen model that produced the previously identified disputed signatures\" in the March 2010 recommendation letters.615\n\nEpstein ER4, p. 2; Strach ER4, p. 1.\n\nEpstein ER4, p. 5.\n\nEpstein ER4, p. 5.\n\n402.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Strach agreed that the signature in the 29 December 2009 PT RTP letter \"matches the general form of the signatures\" found in the March 2010 recommendation letters, including the fine detail, an extra dot, and the additional strokes in different ink form.616 This additional ink is \"optically indistinguishable\" from the ink additions in the 2010 March letters, although this \"does not mean that one pen or ink type has been used as many pens would be in existence with such indistinguishable ink\".617 Dr. Strach also pointed to a faint string of ink marks at the upper left of the main signature line, which was not observed in the 2010 March letters. On that basis, Dr. Strach opined that \"it is probable that the signature was produced by some form of inked impression (such as a high quality stamp impression or other form of printing)\". As to autopen technology, he deemed it unlikely, but did not rule it out.618\n\nStrach ER4, p. 2.\n\nStrach ER4, p. 2.\n\nStrach ER4, p. 2.\n\n403.\n\nWith respect to the PT RTM recommendation letter dated 29 December 2009, Dr. Strach only inspected a .pdf reproduction, but confirmed that the \"general form of the signature corresponds to the form of signatures\" on the March 2010 recommendation letters. However, Dr. Strach stressed that the ends of the lowest stroke \"differ from most of the corresponding ends\" on the other five recommendation letters. While he could not identify the same fine detail as in the PT RTP recommendation letter, he found that the small spot in the PT RTM recommendation letter is \"in the same position relative to the signature\" observed in the other five recommendation letters.619 Because the document is a reproduction, Dr. Strach stated that he could not determine whether the same technology was used to reproduce the signature in the PT RTM recommendation letter as in the other disputed recommendation letters. However, he conceded that it seemed \"plausible that the actual original ink signature which has been reproduced and observed on the PDF image may have been produced using the same technology as was used to produce\" the other signatures in the recommendation letters. The expert again was inclined to find that the signature was produced by \"some form of inked impression (such as a high quality stamp impression or other form of printing)\" and that autopen was possible \"but considered unlikely\".620\n\nStrach ER4, p. 3.\n\nStrach ER4, p. 3.\n\n404.\n\nFor largely the same reasons as for the disputed documents at the Regency level, the Tribunal concludes that the signatures under scrutiny here were not authorized and are the product of a mechanical device. The Tribunal has already weighed the evidence of the Parties\u2019 experts in relation to the identical signatures at the Regency level, and prefers the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s expert Mr. Epstein. That conclusion seems to apply equally here (see paragraph 302 above).\n\n405.\n\nMr. Ishak also confirmed that he did not sign these letters and did not authorize the reproduction of his signature.621 It is further striking that there are two versions of recommendation letters for PT RTM and PT RTP, one from December 2009 and the other from March 2010. Mr. Benjamin\u2019s explanation that the former concerned land use above the surface and the latter land use above and below the surface622 was rebutted by Ms. Nurohmah who stated that, for borrow-for-use permits, the Ministry of Forestry does not \"differentiate whether it\u2019s activity above the surface or activities for below the surface\".623 Neither is there any explanation in the record for the fact that only one series was submitted to the Ministry of Forestry.624\n\nIshak WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7.\n\nBenjamin WS2, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.\n\nTr. (Day 5), 111:3-15 (Tribunal, Nurohmah).\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 11 March 2015, p. 2. The PT RTM recommendation letter is listed on the receipt and minutes of the documents taken during the police search. *See* : Minutes of Confiscation (**Exh. C-379**) ; Police Receipt of Documents Removed from PT ICD\u2019s Offices on 29 August 2014 (**Exh. C-380**).\n\n406.\n\nIt is also striking that both the Regency and the Province would have used the same technology, especially when one considers that the witnesses concur that such technology was unknown within these administrations. These facts rather point to forgery carried out outside the administrations, hence to unauthorized documents. The Claimants' explanation that the documents were generated within the Regency, since officials at the Regency had access to the master signature of Mr. Ishak in his capacity as Governor, is speculation.\n\n407.\n\nFinally, the strokes, which were manually added at the end of the signature lines, show that Mr. Ishak did not produce those signatures. The Tribunal tends to agree with the Respondent that such strokes are rather \"consistent with the behavior of a person forging a signature than an official properly utilizing \u2018high quality stamp impressions' to impart Mr. Ishak's signature to a document in the ordinary course of business\".625\n\nRespondent's Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 30.\n\n408.\n\nIn conclusion, the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations buttress the Tribunal's finding that Mr. Ishak's signatures were reproduced without his authorization. This finding also supports the theory of the existence of a scheme to produce false official documents.\n\nc) Ancillary documents at the level of the central Government\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the authenticity of four Technical Considerations dated 22 September 2010 bearing the signature of the Director General of Mineral, Geothermal and Coal at the MEMR, Mr. Bambang Setiawan.626 A technical consideration letter from the MEMR is required in addition to a recommendation letter from the Governor of East Kalimantan, if a mining company wishes to obtain a borrow-for-use permit from the Ministry of Forestry in order to conduct mining activities in a forestry area located, as it were, in East Kutai. After setting out the Parties' positions (i), the Tribunal will assess the features of the disputed documents (ii) and conduct its assessment (iii).\n\nDocuments nos. 29-32 in the Document Table.\n\n(i) Parties' positions\n----------------------\n\n410.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Technical Considerations are not authentic, which confirms that a scheme to defraud the Republic of Indonesia was put in place.627 The Respondent mainly relies on Mr. Epstein's report according to which the signatures of Mr. Setiawan are identical and were produced by an autopen using the same master signature.628 It also invokes the testimony of Mr. Setiawan that he always signed official documents by hand and \"never authorized anyone to sign or place my signature on any such letters\".629 These facts were confirmed by Mr. Djalil, former Head of the General Affairs and Employment Division of the Directorate General of Mineral and Coal, who stated that Mr. Setiawan \"always personally signs letters by hand\" and that the MEMR does not use autopen devices.630 Mr. Epstein's review of other signatures of Mr. Setiawan showed \"the natural variation of Mr. Setiawan signing his name\".631\n\nR-Comments 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 32-26; R-Comments 2, \u00b6\u00b6 15-20; R-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 53 and 54, items 3-8.\n\nEpstein ER3, p. 3; Respondent's Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 17.\n\nSetiawan WS, \u00b6 9; Tr. (Day 5), 65:25-66:4 (Direct, Setiawan); Respondent's Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 16; R-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 1.\n\nDjalil WS, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16. *See* also: Respondent's Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 16; R-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 1.\n\nRespondent's Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 19; Epstein ER4, p. 4.\n\n411.\n\nThe Respondent further stresses the following elements: (i) the letter numbers belong to other authentic letters signed by Mr. Setiawan with a different subject matter and date;632 (ii) the letters contain an incorrect civil servant identification number (NIP) of Mr. Setiawan;633 (iii) the Claimants' reference to a letter in English signed by Mr. Setiawan without his NIP is unhelpful since, under the prescribed MEMR format, letters written in English must not include the NIP;634 (iv) the letters use the wrong font (Times New Roman instead of Arial) and the stamp refers to MEMR as Department (*Departemen*) rather than Ministry (*Kementarian*), the latter being employed after May 2010;635 (v) the letters contain a signature, stamp and initial, whereas they should only contain a signature and stamp, or a signature and initial;636 (vi) the summary of the exploitation activities for each Ridlatama company is identical \"even though different activities (or no activities) were conducted in the separate blocks\",637 and Ms. Nurohmah indicated that the technical consideration letter was not included in Ridlatama\u2019s 9 September 2009 and 13 March 2010 borrow-for-use permit applications.638\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 3; Djalil WS, \u00b6 18.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 4; Djalil WS \u00b6 17.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 4, note 136; Tr. (Day 5), 85:18-87:23 (Direct, Djalil); MEMR Regulation Number 52 Year 2006 concerning Official Correspondence, pp. 15-17, 42 (**Exh. RLA-204**).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 5. For the Respondent, the Claimants' reference to two of Nusantara's technical consideration letters dated January and February 2010 containing a stamp with *Departemen* is to no avail, since these documents were issued in the \"six-month transitional period from November 2009 to May 2010 during which MEMR moved from using the title *Departemen* to *Kementarian* \". *Id*., note 137; Djalil WS, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 20.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 6.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 8.\n\nNurohmah WS2, \u00b6 5.\n\n412.\n\nThe Respondent also calls attention to the fact that Mr. Setiawan stated that he did not recognize the two initials appearing near Mr. Setiawan\u2019s signature.639 According to his testimony, the initials should be those of the then-Secretary of the Directorate General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal, Dr. Ir. Soemarno Witoro Soelamo, and the then-Director responsible for MEMR\u2019s technical considerations in forestry matters, Ir. Tatang Sabaruddin.640 This is corroborated, so the Respondent argues, by the fact that Messrs. Witoro and Tatang\u2019s initials appear in other letters (for instance, number 2690) from the same day (22 September 2010).641\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 54, item 7; Tr.

(Day 5), 68:18-69:19 (Direct, Setiawan).\n\n413.\n\nLastly, Indonesia refers to Dr. Strach, who acknowledges that the signatures in these documents have some characteristics of autopen signatures, including the uniform pen pressure, blunt ends and smooth lines. The expert also did not rule out a faulty autopen type process to explain the relatively large deposit of ink with a faint ink trail to the left of the signature in three of the four letters.642 Indonesia further emphasizes that Dr. Strach failed to identify any stamp or printing method able to generate such high quality reproductions.643\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 17; R-PHB1, \u00b6 27.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on 3rd and 4th Reports of Dr. Strach, \u00b6 17.\n\n414.\n\nSimilarly to the recommendation letters, the Claimants provide two possible explanations for the identical signatures on the consideration letters. First, mechanical devices are used at various governmental levels to reproduce signatures of officials, including the signature of Mr. Setiawan at the MEMR (good faith authorization).644 Second, having access to Mr. Setiawan's master signature, the Regency orchestrated a \"scam\" and fabricated the consideration letters \"as a means of making Ridlatama think they were progressing\" (bad faith authorization).645\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\n415.\n\nWhile the Claimants agree that Mr. Setiawan's signatures on the disputed documents \"cannot be the product of human handwriting as they are, essentially, identical\",646 they dispute Mr. Epstein's opinion that the signatures are the product of an autopen.647 They further stress that the Respondent did not dispute the authenticity of the seal partly overlapping with Mr. Setiawan's signature.648 According to the Claimants, Mr. Epstein's \"cursory conclusions\" fail to provide the Tribunal \"with the means by which to assess objectively his conclusions that the signatures were a result of an Autopen device\".649\n\nReply, \u00b6 51.\n\nReply, \u00b6 52.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 41.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 56; C-Answers, \u00b6 18.\n\n416.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants argue that Mr. Epstein does not address the discrete features of the signatures, such as the fluidity of the ink, the tip-width of the alleged writing instrument, the pressure and density of the writing and any alterations or artefacts on or around the writing.650 The Claimants also cite to the \"detailed report\" of Dr. Strach, which, in addition to such aspects as pen pressure, ink-line width, microscopic appearance, and infrared properties, identified \"incidental marks\" which are marked as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" in the images below:651\n\nReply, \u00b6 57.\n\nStrach ER3, Annex C; C-Answers, \u00b6 19.\n\n417.\n\nFor the Claimants' expert, marks labelled as \"D\" are of special importance since \"they are variable in appearance, comprise large deposits of ink, have a faint ink \u2018trail' and share the same ink characteristics as the signature and its surrounding artefacts\".652\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 19.\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimants also point to the Respondent's failure to produce additional consideration letters to test the testimony of Messrs. Setiawan and Djalil.653 However, for the Claimants, the six Nusantara consideration letters in the record suffice to \"raise real questions\" about the reliability of the evidence given by Messrs. Setiawan and Djalil, especially because they contain \"several of the *same* irregularities\" identified with respect to the disputed MEMR letters.654\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 25.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 25, referring to (**Exh. C-525 to C-530**).\n\n419.\n\nFirst, the letterheads of the Nusantara consideration letters also use the word *Kementarian* (Department), while the stamp uses the word *Departemen*.655 Second, Mr. Djalil is wrong when he states that from December 2009 Mr. Setiawan affixed the *Kementarian* stamp since the document he relies on, dated 21 December 2009, also uses the *Departemen* stamp.656 Third, a letter signed by Mr. Setiawan on 21 September 2010 does not contain his NIP at all.657 Fourth, Mr. Djalil did not dispute the authenticity of the initials next to Mr. Setiawan's signature and the Respondent failed to provide an explanation \"for whose initials these are or how these apparently authentic initials were placed on supposedly fabricated documents\".658\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 27; C-PHB1, \u00b6 41.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, referring to Letter of 21 December 2009 from Bambang Setiawan, the Director General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to the Regent of East Kutai (**Exh. R-131**).\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 30.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n420.\n\nFifth, the copies of the MEMR register produced by the Respondent \"appear to be missing key information\".659 Two entries on 21 September 2010 appear to have been covered and five entries on 22 September 2010 are completely blank.660 Therefore, the Claimants argue that \"it may be that the disputed MEMR Letters are recorded elsewhere in the MEMR register\".661 In addition, other notations in the 21-23 September 2010 extract do not include recipient names.662 Moreover, the Respondent failed to produce documents signed by Mr. Setiawan on 23 September 2010 and \"numerous documents in the 21-22 September register extract\".663 Sixth and finally, the Claimants note that the maps attached to the Nusantara technical letters depict the four Ridlatama blocks and do \"not show *any* Nusantara companies overlapping with the Ridlatama blocks\".664\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 36.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 36.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 39.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 37.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 38.\n\nC-Answers, \u00b6 42.\n\n(ii) Main features of the disputed documents\n--------------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe four disputed letters dated 22 September 2010 from Mr. Setiawan, Director General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal at the MEMR, relate to Technical Considerations for PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR's borrow-for-use forestry permit applications.665 Each letter comprises a decision letter and a summary of the application for borrow-for-use permits submitted by the respective Ridlatama company. The decision letter refers to an application letter of the respective Ridlatama company and supports the company's application. It is drafted on the letterhead of the Ministry (*Kementarian*) of Energy and Mineral Resources. The decree number and the issuance date are shown below the letterhead. The signature of Mr. Setiawan is at the end of the decision letter and, as seen in the image in paragraph 416 above, partly overlaps with the official seal, which refers to the Department (*Departemen*) of Energy and Mineral Resources. There is also a personal identification number (NIP) below Mr. Setiawan's signature. Finally, two initials are located to the right and left of Mr. Setiawan's signature.\n\nDocuments nos. 29-32 in the Document Table.\n\n(iii) Assessment\n----------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that the Parties' experts agree that the disputed signatures were not handwritten and that they are identical high quality reproductions.\n\n423.\n\nAs to the technology employed, the Tribunal favors Mr. Epstein's view of an autopen, also because Dr. Strach was unable to name another method resulting in high quality reproductions and could not rule out that the ink deposits and faint ink trails were the product of a faulty autopen.666\n\nStrach ER3, \u00b6 12.\n\n424.\n\nThe ink marks which Dr. Strach highlighted do not seem to justify a contrary conclusion. Dr. Strach does not draw clear inferences from such marks identified as \"A\" to \"D\" in image in paragraph 416 above. In particular with respect to mark \"D\", Dr. Strach confirmed that the ink properties were \"different from those of neighbouring stamp impressions, print and (handwritten) ink initials\", and that it was \"similar to that of the signature ink line apart from being darker/more intense near the centre of the larger dark mark\".667 In the end, Dr. Strach conceded that he did \"not have a full explanation of mark \u2018D'\", but that a \"feasible explanation\" is that it is \"the edge or matrix edge effect of an otherwise high quality stamp impression\".668 By contrast, as was discussed earlier, the Respondent provided evidence that autopens may produce such marks.\n\nStrach ER3, \u00b6 9.\n\nStrach ER3, \u00b6 12.\n\n425.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Mr. Setiawan's testimony, which was confirmed by Mr. Djalil, that he always signs official documents by hand. The Tribunal also finds that the anomalies identified on the disputed documents further corroborate the Respondent's case. This is particularly so in respect of (i) the outdated NIP number of Mr. Setiawan,669 (ii) the incorrect designation of the MEMR as a Department (*Departemen*), whereas the term Ministry (*Kementarian*) was used after May 2010 when the transitory period ended, and (iii) the two initials which Mr. Setiawan did not recognize in combination with the absence of the initials of Messrs. Witoro and Tatang. In contrast to Mr. Setiawan, Mr. Djalil did not mention in his witness statement that he failed to recognize the two initials surrounding Mr. Setiawan's signature, but the Tribunal notes in this respect that the Claimants did not question Mr. Djalil on this issue during cross-examination and provided no further explanations in this regard in their subsequent submissions. Therefore, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Mr. Setiawan's testimony on these initials. The Tribunal further notes that, in the same way as with the recommendation letters addressed further above, the Claimants' explanation that the documents were generated within the Regency as part of a \"scam\" to mislead the Ridlatama companies is speculative.\n\nMr. Setiawan explained that the NIP appearing in the disputed documents was outdated and that a new NIP had been issued since 2008. Tr. (Day 5), 72:23-73:15, 74:15-19 (Tribunal, Setiawan).\n\n426.\n\nFinally, the fact that an autopen or similarly sophisticated device was used to reproduce signatures at yet a third level of Government reinforces the probable existence of a scheme to fabricate official documents to provide a mantle of legitimacy to Ridlatama's operations in the EKCP. This assessment is further supported by the review of the last set of disputed documents, namely the Re-Enactment Decrees.\n\nd) The Re-Enactment Decrees\n---------------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent also claims that the four Re-Enactment Decrees of 14 May 2010 are forged (documents nos. 25-28 in the Document Table). After setting out the Parties' positions (i), the Tribunal will detail the main features of the disputed documents (ii) and proceed to its assessment (iii).\n\n(i) Parties' positions\n----------------------\n\n428.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Re-Enactment Decrees \"never made sense\", as they were allegedly issued just 10 days after Mr. Noor revoked the Ridlatama exploitation upgrades. The Respondent also notes that the Claimants have been reluctant to address these Re-Enactment Decrees. When they did, their position changed multiple times \"moving from silence to \u2018bemusement' to \u2018confusion' to \u2018no position' and now to \u2018bad faith authorization'\".670\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 13. *See* also: R-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 55, 113.\n\n429.\n\nThe Respondent invokes the following elements in support of forgery, irrespective of the fact that Mr. Noor's evidence is disregarded because he did not appear at the hearing.671 First, the forensic experts agree that Mr. Noor's signatures were not handwritten and that they are identical.672 Second, Mr. Ramadani testified that he prepared the Revocation Decrees, but that the Legal Section did not prepare Re-Enactment Decrees.673 Third, Mr. Ramadani also stated that Mr. Noor did not authorize his signature being placed on the disputed documents,674 a fact corroborated by a letter from Mr. Noor dated 7 October 2010.675 Fourth, the Re-Enactment Decrees bear numbers that belong to other documents and are not registered in the 2010 Regency Registration Book for Decrees.676 Fifth, Mr. Ordiansyah called attention to the fact that the decrees have no maps and that the PLTR Spatial Planning database shows that the mining areas belong to Nusantara.677 Sixth, as Mr. Ramadani explained, the practice of the Regency was to issue new licenses to reinstate a revoked license, as opposed to issuing re-enactment decrees.678 Seventh, the Claimants' witness, Mr. Benjamin, testified that he had never heard of or seen the Re-Enactment Decrees.679 Eighth, the Claimants provided no evidence of protests by Ridlatama or the Claimants, which allegedly caused Mr. Noor to revoke the Revocation Decrees and re-enact the exploitation upgrades.680 Ninth, the Claimants started proceedings in the Samarinda Administrative Court to seek a revocation of the Revocation Decrees, and provided no cogent reason for doing so when the Re-Enactment Decrees expressly stated that the revocation was no longer valid.681\n\nR-PHB2, \u00b6 28.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 57.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 57; Tr. (Day 4), 150:22-23 (Direct, Ramadani).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 57; Tr. (Day 4), 152:14-17 (Direct, Ramadani).\n\nLetter of 7 October 2010 from the Regent of East Kutai to the Secretary to Region Province of East Kalimantan (**Exh. R-072**).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 57; Tr.

(Day 7), 110:9-17 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 56.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 56.\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimants had a clear motive to forge the Re-Enactment Decrees, since Churchill would have been under an obligation to publicly disclose the revocation under the London Stock Exchange rules, which would have jeopardized Churchill's offering of securities and caused a collapse of the share price.682\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 58.\n\n431.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' bad faith authorization theory is \"rife with speculation\" and that they provide \"no evidence\" to corroborate their position.\n\n432.\n\nFor the Claimants, once Mr. Noor's testimony is struck out or disregarded, the only evidence on record to impugn the Re-Enactment Decrees is (i) the undisputed expert evidence that Mr. Noor's signature was not applied by hand, (ii) Mr. Ramadani's evidence that the numbers on the Re-Enactment Decrees are used on other decrees, and (iii) Mr. Noor's letter of 7 October 2010.683 According to the Claimants, these elements are insufficient for a finding of forgery. The Claimants contend that with respect to (ii), wrong decree numbers \"could be attributable to simple clerical error\", and with respect to (iii), that the evidentiary value of the 7 October 2010 letter is \"severely compromised\" by Mr. Noor's refusal to attend the hearing.684\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 38(e).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 38(e).\n\n433.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimants submit that there is a basis for finding that the Re-Enactment Decrees were authorized \"but in the bad faith sense\".685 The Re-Enactment Decrees were mainly favorable to Mr. Noor; he could \"play both sides\" by inducing Ridlatama and the Claimants to believe that their rights were safe, while assuring Nusantara that \"for the right price, the re-enactment decrees could be denied and the EKCP could be given to them\".686 The Re-Enactment Decrees provided a means to Mr. Noor to delay passing the mining areas to Nusantara \"while he tried to extract improper payments from Ridlatama\". Indeed, the 7 October 2010 letter was issued six months later, providing Mr. Noor \"more than enough time to hold an \u2018auction' of rights to the EKCP\".687\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that, even if the Re-Enactment Decrees were found not to be authorized, this would only affect their claim for restitution of amounts spent between the Claimants' receipt of the Re-Enactment Decrees and the dismissal of their action in the Samarinda Administrative Court.688\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 68.\n\n(ii) Main features of the disputed documents\n--------------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe four disputed decrees of 14 May 2010 from the then-Regent, Mr. Noor, relate to the purported re-enactment of the exploitation upgrades that were revoked by Mr. Noor on May 4, 2010.689 Through these decrees, Mr. Noor purported to (i) re-enact the four Ridlatama exploitation upgrades of 27 March 2009, (ii) declare all other related licenses to be valid again, and (iii) revoke the Revocation Decrees of 4 May 2010. The letters are drafted on letterhead with the emblem of the Regency of East Kutai and a decree number on the first page. The signature block with Mr. Noor's signature and the date are on the last page.\n\nDocuments nos. 25-28 in the Document Table.\n\n436.\n\nDr. Strach called attention to the variation in width of the signature lines, including a \"pronounced taper at the right end of the main component of the signature\".690 He also identified \"very small spots\" towards the left of each signature and two \"closely spaced fine small strokes\" to the right and below the tapered end of the main part of each signature.691 Dr. Strach further mentioned a \"repeated sudden narrowing\" near the top of the second arch of an \"m\" like feature, and \"repeated smudge like marks above and below the left extremity of the rising lower line associated with each signature\".692\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 21.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 21.\n\nStrach ER1, \u00b6 21.\n\n437.\n\nThe following image depicts the two disputed signatures and the recurrent features identified by Dr. Strach:693\n\nStrach ER1, Annex G. Dr. Strach provided the following explanations on the marks he identified: \"The repeating fine features (except where obscured by text) associated with the signatures lines [on the four Re-Enactment Decrees] are marked A, C and D (spots) and B (void in the underside of the ink line). Repeating smudge like marks are indicated by letter E\".\n\n(iii) Assessment\n----------------\n\n438.\n\nThe record shows that the Re-Enactment Decrees are neither authentic nor authorized, which significantly reinforces the Respondent's case that a scheme was put in place to fabricate documents.\n\n439.\n\nSeveral facts are undisputed. The Parties agree that Mr. Noor signed the Revocation Decrees dated 4 May 2010. Their experts agree that Mr. Noor did not sign the Re-Enactment Decrees, that the signatures in all four decrees are identical, and that they are high quality reproductions.694 The Re-Enactment Decrees were issued just ten days after the Revocation Decrees.\n\nEpstein ER2, p. 8; Strach ER1, \u00b6 21.\n\n440.\n\nBeyond these established facts, the record is less clear cut. As to the technology employed, Dr. Strach is again unable to identify one, other than autopen, that could produce such high quality signatures.\n\n441.\n\nFurther, the date of the Re-Enactment Decrees raises serious doubts. Why should a government revoke a license one day and reinstate it ten days later? If the Claimants' re-enactment theory were to reflect reality, one would expect to find cogent evidence for the reasons of such an unusual fact pattern. However, the record reveals none. While the Tribunal has insufficient facts to link the Re-Enactment Decrees to the disclosure obligations for companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange, it is struck by the fact that Mr. Benjamin, a witness presented by the Claimants who at the relevant time was PT ICD\u2019s Director/President and was in regular contact with the Claimants\u2019 partners from Ridlatama, knew of the revocation but had never heard of the re-enactment.695 Had it been real, the reenactment would have been a major development for the Claimants\u2019 business, certainly worth reporting to close friends and associates, and in particular to Mr. Benjamin who was managing the Claimants\u2019 local investment vehicle.\n\nTr. (Day 7), 110:9-17 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\n442.\n\nAnother aspect weighing against the Claimants\u2019 argumentation lies in Mr. Ramadani\u2019s assertion, confirmed by Mr. Sianipar, that new licenses, not re-enactment decrees reviving revoked licenses, would have been issued, if at all.696 This statement seems plausible and there is nothing in the record to contradict it.\n\nTr. (Day 4), 150:22-151:9 (Direct, Ramadani); Tr. (Day 5), 99:8-18 (Tribunal, Sianipar).\n\n443.\n\nFinally, the Claimants\u2019 bad faith authorization theory, according to which Mr. Noor sought to \"play both sides\" is speculative and unsupported by facts.697 The Claimants also argued that Mr. Noor acted \"inconsistently at times\", notably when sending a letter on 3 September 2009 to the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (\"AIM\") informing that Ridlatama\u2019s licenses had been forged, while sending letters to the Ministry of Forestry on the same day supporting Ridlatama\u2019s forestry permits.698 Due to Mr. Noor\u2019s failure to appear at the hearing, the Tribunal has no further information on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Noor\u2019s conduct on that occasion. However, the Tribunal simply notes that this allegedly inconsistent conduct, even if assumed to be true for present purposes, is insufficient to prove \"erratic decision-making\" by Mr. Noor in May 2010.699 Indeed, the Claimants failed to provide any credible explanation why the Revocation Decrees were signed by hand while the Re-Enactment Decrees were signed with a mechanical device.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 38(f).\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 38(f).\n\n444.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the disputed Re-Enactment Decrees are neither authentic nor authorized. Their existence significantly weakens the Claimants\u2019 position on all other documents. Indeed, the Tribunal specifically asked the Parties about the effect on the Claimants\u2019 overall case if only the signatures in the Re-Enactment Decrees were unauthentic or unauthorized. In their response, the Claimants accepted that, if the Tribunal were to find that the Re-Enactment Decrees were not authorized, it \"could add weight\" to the Respondent\u2019s case \"against the other disputed documents\".700 While a finding that the Re-Enactment Decrees are unauthentic and unauthorized is not necessary to reach the same conclusion for the other impugned documents, the fact that the Re-Enactment Decrees were most likely generated through the same technology shows a recurrent pattern of forgery.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 67.\n\n**2.5. Who forged the disputed documents?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the factual question of the authorship of the disputed documents, starting with the Parties\u2019 positions (a) followed by its assessment (b).\n\na) Parties\u2019 positions\n---------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"evidence of \u2018how\u2019 the impugned documents were signed is clear and goes a long way to answering \u2018who\u2019 did so\".701 For the Respondent, Ridlatama signed the documents.702 Only Ridlatama had, so says the Respondent, the \"motive, means or opportunity to fabricate\" these documents.703\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 17.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 59.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 59.\n\n447.\n\nPrior to the hearing, the Respondent\u2019s primary contention was that Ridlatama was the sole responsible party and that the Claimants were duped. According to the Respondent, Ridlatama fabricated the disputed documents and disseminated them to various government agencies to create a mantle of legitimacy in a larger scheme to defraud the Republic of Indonesia. The Respondent thereafter argued that the hearing revealed that Mr. Mazak, Churchill's Managing Director, was involved in the fraud, which demonstrated the Claimants' complicity.704 For the Respondent, \"the testimony of Claimants\" witnesses describing the actions of Mr. Mazak undercut any notion that he was an unwitting dupe of Ridlatama\".705\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 99; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 22(1), 41.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 65.\n\n448.\n\nThe Respondent explains that it was Mr. Mazak who built up the relationship with Ridlatama and was responsible for Churchill's day-to-day operations in Indonesia through PT ICD.706 Following the disappointing results in the Sendawar Coal Project, by 2007 he was under pressure to come up with a viable project in the EKCP.707\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 66.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 67.\n\n449.\n\nMore specifically, Indonesia highlighted the following facts allegedly showing Mr. Mazak's participation in the fraud scheme: (i) he forwarded the \"copy and paste\" PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses to Mr. Gunter in May 2007;708 (ii) he handed over Ridlatama's documents to Mr. Benjamin without those \"copy and paste\" licenses;709 (iii) he \"masterminded\" the ReEnactment Decrees;710 (iv) he sought to enlist Mr. Kurniawan in April 2015;711 (v) he told Mr. Quinlivan about \"fictitious\" handover ceremonies presided by the Regent;712 (vi) he arranged for STP lawyers to opine on the *bona fides* of the Ridlatama licenses;713 and (vii) he failed to ensure that the Ridlatama licenses were included as attachments to the Cooperation Agreements concluded between PT ICD and Ridlatama.714\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 66, item 1, 87; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 22(1).\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 66, item 2, 87.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 66, item 6; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12 note 19.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 66, item 7; R-PHB2, \u00b6 3.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 47, 66, item 3.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 66, item 4.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 66, item 5.\n\n450.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants dispute that the documents were fabricated by Ridlatama and that they were involved in a fraud. As a primary argument, they rely on their theory of good faith authorization, namely that the disputed documents were generated with authorization within the respective government agencies. Alternatively, the Claimants put forward their bad faith authorization theory, which implies that someone within the Regency applied Mr. Ishak\u2019s signature \"as part of a design\" to make the licenses \"plausibly deniable\".715\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 7.\n\n451.\n\nIn connection with the argument of bad faith authorization, Churchill and Planet allege that Mr. Putra\u2019s involvement in processing the disputed licenses was \"extensive\", as he (i) drafted the 2007 staff analysis; (ii) cosigned the spatial analyses for the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses; (iii) coordinated and initialed the draft decrees for PT RTM and PT RTP; (iv) drafted the Nusantara staff analysis of 19 May 2008; and (v) liaised with Mr. Noor in processing and issuing the Exploitation Licenses.716 The Claimants also stress that the authenticity of the official Garuda seal partly overlapping with the disputed signatures is unchallenged, which further corroborates that the contentious documents were produced within the government agencies.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 35.\n\n452.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this bad faith scenario would allow the Regency, if the Claimants and Ridlatama later discovered commercially viable coal reserves (which they did), to \"deny it ever granted Ridlatama exploration rights and offer to re-licence the proven ground to Nusantara (or any other party) - for a price\".717\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 7.\n\n453.\n\nThis scam, so the Claimants say, includes the fabrication of the documents from other agencies, such as the Technical Recommendation \"as a means of making Ridlatama think they were progressing\".718 The Claimants further argue that the Re-Enactment Decrees made it possible for Mr. Noor to \"play both sides\" by letting Ridlatama and the Claimants believe that their rights were safe, while at the same time assuring Nusantara that the ReEnactment Decrees could be denied and the EKCP given to it \"for the right price\".719 Finally, even if Ridlatama was involved in a fraudulent scheme, so say the Claimants, Mr. Ishak\u2019s testimony implicating \"some kind of corruption\" between Mr. Putra and Ridlatama shows that there is no basis \"for a finding that Ridlatama acted alone\".720\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 53.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 76.\n\nb) Assessment\n-------------\n\n454.\n\nThe signatures not being authentic, it mainly remains now for the Tribunal to determine who generated the contentious documents, including whether they were created within or outside the relevant governmental agencies and what role Ridlatama and the Claimants played, if any.\n\n455.\n\nOn the Respondent's side, three possible explanations are advanced. First, the disputed documents were fabricated by Ridlatama and the Claimants were duped victims, who must bear the risks inherent in the choice of their business partners. Second, the Claimants themselves were involved in the fraud. The third explanation was added by Mr. Ishak at the hearing when envisaging a corrupt official within the Regency of East Kutai.721 On the basis of facts which emerged at the hearing, Indonesia insisted on the second scenario as being the one which should be accepted by the Tribunal.\n\nTr. (Day 3), 104:20-25 (Cross, Ishak).\n\n456.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants deny being involved in any fraud and essentially argue that the documents were generated within the Regency either with the authorization of Mr. Ishak or as a result of an official exceeding his powers. According to them, there is no evidence of fraud or corruption by Ridlatama. At any rate, Mr. Ishak's apologies to Churchill during the hearing show that the Claimants are victims and not offenders in the event that there was corruption.722\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 85(c); C-PHB2, \u00b6 6.\n\n457.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent's new accusations that Churchill structured its investments to facilitate fraud are \"ambush\".723 They explain that they prepared their defense on the basis of the Respondent's allegations prior to the hearing that only Ridlatama was involved in the fraud, not the Claimants or PT ICD.724 In any event, the Claimants argue that even if Ridlatama were found to have engaged in forgery, this would leave their claims unaffected since the evidence suggests an \"inside job\" within the Regency, the actions of the Regency being attributable to the State.725\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6 6.\n\nC-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7-8,\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 75.\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined above that there was insufficient evidence to uphold the Claimants\u2019 bad faith authorization theory. Indeed, there is no proof that someone within the Regency issued \"plausibly deniable\"726 licenses and fabricated the other disputed documents to satisfy the expectations of Ridlatama and the Claimants that the approval processes were properly advancing. There is no evidence that the Regency or any Regency official was in possession of an autopen or similarly sophisticated technology. It is not established either that Regency officials requested payments from Ridlatama to keep the disputed mining rights or from Nusantara to obtain rights to the EKCP. Moreover, there is no evidence that Nusantara conspired to strip Ridlatama of its mining rights, for instance, by inducing Regency officials to revoke the mining licenses. Nor are there indications that Mr. Noor was seeking to \"play both sides\"727 so as to auction off the mining rights to the highest bidder. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that this bad faith scenario does not assist in ascertaining the author of the forgery.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 7.\n\nC-PHB1, \u00b6 69.\n\n459.\n\nAlthough the record does not support the Claimants\u2019 bad faith authorization claim, a number of facts demonstrate that someone within the Regency assisted in the process of introducing the fabricated documents into the Regency\u2019s databases and archives, thereby assisting in creating an appearance of legitimacy to the fraudulent scheme. Various elements, such as the staff analysis prepared by Mr. Putra, the spatial analyses prepared by Mr. Ordiansyah and signed by Mr. Putra, and the draft decrees, show that the mining applications of PT RTM and PT RTP were processed within the Regency until the penultimate stage. In particular, the draft decrees were circulated to the five heads of departments who affixed their initials in the coordination box. However, as was seen above, Mr. Ishak never signed these draft decrees, although his signature should have been affixed first on these draft decrees, as Mr. Ramadani convincingly explained.728\n\nTr. (Day 5), 9:22-10:6 (Cross, Ramadani).\n\n460.\n\nEven more significant for present purposes is the fact that, in addition to Mr. Putra's initials in the coordination boxes of the two draft decrees, his initials also appear in three other places in each draft decree (i.e., in the decision letter, the attachment setting out the obligations of the license holder, and the attached map) next to the space where Mr. Ishak was supposed to affix his signature.\n\n461.\n\nAnother element pointing towards Mr. Putra's involvement is the fact that the disputed Survey Licenses for PT RTM and PT RTP were entered in the register book of the Legal Section. A similar indication can be seen in Mr. Ramadani's testimony according to which the registrar told him that it was Mr. Putra who requested the registration and promised to provide the signed decrees at a later time, which he never did.\n\n462.\n\nBy contrast, the official Garuda seal which partly overlaps with the fabricated signatures does not appear a conclusive element. The Claimants relied on Dr. Strach's expertise to argue that the Garuda seal was applied after the disputed signatures and thus showed that the disputed documents were generated within the Regency. The Respondent replied that anyone could fabricate these seals until 2012, when the Regency introduced heightened security measures following various instances of abuse. In reality, Dr. Strach stated that he was unable to ascertain the exact sequence of the placement of the signatures and the seal without further tests. On that basis and considering Mr. Kurniawan's testimony on the recurrent falsification of the Garuda seal prior to 2012, the Tribunal is unable to draw any useful conclusion from the presence of the Garuda seal in the disputed documents.\n\n463.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal must address the possibility of corruption. Corruption only came up at the hearing, when Mr. Ishak was presented with the staff analysis drawn up by Mr. Putra. The Governor reacted by saying that there could have been some form of nepotism or corruption between Mr. Putra and Ridlatama in relation to the EKCP.729 A little later in this examination, he called the EKCP a \"major corruption case in our country\".730 Mr. Ishak even implied that Mr. Noor was involved in the scheme. On a follow up question from the Tribunal, he answered as follows:\n\n\"Q. [...] You were asked about Mr. Noor and your answer was not entirely clear, that also Mr. Noor would also possibly be involved in corruption here. I would like to be clear whether or not that is the case.\n\nA. I do not know what happened after I left, but what is clear, one difficulty I have, suddenly the Regent has a private jet. It doesn\u2019t make sense. An official suddenly has a private jet. How much it [sic] price for a private jet?\".731\n\nTr. (Day 3), 104:16-25 (Cross, Ishak) and 106:1-3 (Tribunal, Ishak).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 108:18-21 (Cross, Ishak).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 106:4-13 (Tribunal, Ishak). *See* also: Tr. (Day 3), 105:15-22 (Cross, Ishak).\n\n464.\n\nMr. Gunter also mentioned that the payment of facilitation fees was commonplace in Indonesia. He stated, however, that he had no direct knowledge of any such payments by Ridlatama. Specifically, he stated that \"there is always a facilitation fee that applies to most things here [i.e., in Indonesia], unfortunately\". While he did not know any specifics regarding Ridlatama, he \"would consider there would need to be\" such payments.732\n\nTr. (Day 7), 74:21-24 and 75:22 (Tribunal, Gunter).\n\n465.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal also recalls that the Claimants sought to obtain, and the Tribunal ordered, the production of documents relating to investigations conducted by Indonesia\u2019s Corruption Eradication Commission (\"KPK\") with respect to Messrs. Ishak and Noor. The Respondent refused to produce these documents by invoking privilege, a claim addressed above (see paragraph 250). Finally, with respect to the Re-Enactment Decrees, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have alleged that Mr. Noor was trying to \"play both sides\" to auction off the EKCP to the highest bidder.\n\n466.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the evidence on record is insufficient to establish that the issuance of the disputed documents involved corrupt practices. It is true that corruption is inherently difficult to prove. However, even taking such difficulty into consideration, there must be facts on the record, at least in the form of some circumstantial evidence or so-called red flags, that signal the corruption. General statements such as Mr. Gunter\u2019s testimony, or suppositions and implications such as Mr. Ishak\u2019s assertions are insufficient. On that basis alone, the Tribunal is unable to make a finding of corruption.\n\n467.\n\nHaving discarded this possibility, the Tribunal goes on reviewing the role of Ridlatama and the Claimants. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a number of facts point to the involvement of an outsider. First, the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, Messrs. Ishak, Armin, Ordiansyah, Ramadani, Djalil and Setiawan, all stated that they had never heard of an autopen and that official documents were always signed by hand. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt these statements, especially since the Claimants' witnesses confirmed the practice of hand signatures.733\n\nTr. (Day 7), 35:11 (Cross, Gunter) and 57:20-58:8 (Tribunal, Gunter); Tr. (Day 7), 97:119 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\n468.\n\nSecond, the same technology, most likely an autopen, was used to reproduce the disputed signatures at three different levels of the Indonesian Government, namely the Regency of East Kutai, the province of East Kalimantan, and the central Government in Jakarta, when none of these offices used mechanical devices to reproduce signatures on official documents.\n\n469.\n\nThird, the existence of three different versions of PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, including one version with signatures of Mr. Ishak reproduced with an autopen and another one with his copied and pasted signatures, strongly suggests that these latter two versions were generated outside of the Regency. Indeed, it is undisputable that the Gunter Documents bearing the copied and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak were doctored. Further, the use of an autopen, when it has been established that government offices did not have such a device available, indicates that the autopen signatures were affixed by an outsider.\n\n470.\n\nFourth, the exact same signatures of Mr. Ishak which appear on the disputed mining licenses and other ancillary documents at the Regency level are also found in two mining licenses granted to Swasembada, a company which happens to be controlled by directors of Ridlatama. This comes in addition to the absence of identical signatures in comparator licenses produced by the Respondent.\n\n471.\n\nFifth, the existence of the Re-Enactment Decrees, bearing unauthentic signatures issued ten days after the Revocation Decrees which the then-Regent Mr. Noor had signed by hand, significantly undermines the Claimants' contention that the disputed documents came from within the Regency. Indeed, the Claimants have provided no credible explanation for the Re-Enactment Decrees.\n\n472.\n\nSixth and last, Ridlatama, not the Regency, circulated the disputed licenses and related documentation to governmental agencies allegedly to ensure that they received all relevant documentation in case the Regency failed to provide it. Under normal circumstances, this element would appear neutral, but in the present context of fabricated signatures, it would support a finding that Ridlatama was involved in this fraudulent scheme.\n\n473.\n\nThe last question which the Tribunal must answer here is whether the Claimants participated in or had knowledge of the fraud. As mentioned earlier, until the hearing, the Respondent did not seek to implicate the Claimants in the fraud, but argued that they must suffer the consequences of partnering with fraudsters. The Tribunal also notes that Indonesia\u2019s police initiated criminal investigations on forgery in March 2014, including by searching PT ICD\u2019s premises, seizing relevant documentation and hard drives, and interrogating Mr. Benjamin. These investigations have not led to evidence used by the Respondent in the present proceedings proving that the Claimants were directly involved in the fraud. With respect to Mr. Mazak\u2019s alleged involvement, the Tribunal sees no conclusive proof of his or Churchill\u2019s involvement in the fact that he transmitted the \"copy and paste\" PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses to Mr. Gunter in May 2007, or that he gave Ridlatama\u2019s documents to Mr. Benjamin without including the \"copy and paste\" license. There is also insufficient evidence that he \"masterminded\" the Re-Enactment Decrees, as the Respondent alleges.734 Finally, the Tribunal fails to see the relevance of the fact that he contacted Mr. Kurniawan in 2015 in order to obtain the Ridlatama documents in his possession.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 58, 66, item 6; R-PHB2, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12, note 19.\n\n474.\n\nOn the other hand, the record shows that the Claimants and Ridlatama were closely associated and that they liaised regularly during the relevant time. First, PT ICD was initially established by Ridlatama and then acquired by Churchill in 2006.735 Second, the Claimants chose their partners because of their \"good connections\" with the Indonesian Government, and in particular with the Regency of East Kutai.736 Third, PT ICD ensured that Ridlatama circulated the disputed licenses and related documentation to governmental agencies.737 Finally, the Tribunal cannot lose sight that the Claimants, and in particular Churchill, which is quoted on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, stood most to gain from the Re-Enactment Decrees, since they obviated the need to publicly disclose the revocation of the mining licenses which had occurred ten days earlier.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 13 March 2013, \u00b6 62.\n\nKurniawan WS1, \u00b6 10.\n\nBenjamin WS1, \u00b6 15(b).\n\n475.\n\nWhile these elements suggest that the Claimants may have been involved, they are insufficient to reach a definitive finding that the Claimants were the authors or instigators of the forgeries and the fraud.\n\n476.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal is of the view that the forgeries and the fraud were orchestrated by author(s) outside of the Regency, most likely Ridlatama, who benefited from the assistance from an insider to introduce the fabricated documents into the Regency's databases and archives. While the record points towards Ridlatama rather than the Claimants in relation to the forgery of the contentious documents, the Tribunal does not need to make a definitive finding to draw the proper legal consequences as the analysis below will show. It suffices for present purposes that, on the basis of the record, there is no conceivable author other than Ridlatama.\n\n477.\n\nBearing these facts in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the legal consequences, and in particular, to the Respondent's request that all of the Claimants' claims be dismissed.\n\n**C. Legal consequences**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 positions**\n-------------------------\n\n478.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal issue an award dismissing all of the claims brought by the Claimants.738 In short, the Respondent asserts that \"Claimants cannot bring claims on the basis of forged documents\".739 In addition, the Respondent argues that a finding of forgery of the mining undertaking licenses has the consequence of \"rendering the exploitation upgrades null and void and thereby eliminating any basis\" for the claims before this Tribunal.740 This follows, so the Respondent says, from the fact that all the claims are based on the validity of Ridlatama's mining rights in the EKCP.741 In other words, the Respondent argues that there was no EKCP if the licenses were forged.742\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 147; R-PHB2, \u00b6 50; R-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 2; R-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 2.\n\nR-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 5.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 68.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 68.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 74.\n\n479.\n\nRelying on the maxim *nemo dat quod non habet,* the Respondent argues that the Claimants cannot assert claims \"on the basis of rights that are non-existent\"743 and that \"the beneficiary of a forgery can be in no better position than the person who committed the forgery\".744 Claims arising from the purported interference with an alleged right obtained by forgery cannot find substantive protection under the BITs \"whether asserted by the culpable party or its assignee\", even if the Claimants had acted in good faith.745 To the Claimants\u2019 argument that the \"vast majority\" of their investments would remain legally valid and unaffected by a finding of forgery, the Respondent objects that the Claimants raised no claims arising from investments unrelated to the EKCP.746\n\nR-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 27.\n\nR-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 33.\n\nR-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 27.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 75.\n\n480.\n\nThe Respondent further stresses that the forgery of the disputed licenses \"informed the decision to revoke the exploitation upgrades\".747 But even if the upgrades were revoked for a reason other than forgery, these forgeries must lead to the dismissal of the claims. Indeed, allowing the claims to continue in these circumstances \"would be tantamount to rewarding conduct that is blatantly illegal and to endorsing Ridlatama\u2019s strategy of laundering forged documents\".748 According to the Respondent, such a result would be incompatible with \"international law, Indonesian law and any system of law\", contrary to international public policy, and seriously damaging to the administration of justice.749\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 76.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 76.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 79; R-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 44; R-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 5.\n\n481.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimants were not good faith investors and did not exercise \"a reasonable level of due diligence in investigating the forgery of the impugned licenses\"; nor did they behave like a \"reasonably prudent investor in the circumstances\".750 They were aware of the risks involved in investing in the Indonesian mining sector and \"forgery was not an implausible risk\" in view of the problem of overlapping licenses.751 Moreover, there is *prima facie* evidence, according to the Respondent, that Mr. Mazak was complicit in the fraudulent scheme.752 At the very least, \"Mr. Mazak was reckless or negligent in his dealings with Ridlatama and shut his eyes to what would have been obvious\".753 For the Respondent, Mr. Mazak's role evinces that the Claimants were either \"complicit in the forgeries or deliberately ignored evidence of wrongdoing and resisted further *bona fide* inquiries into it\".754\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 98; R-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 37; R-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 7.\n\nR-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 8.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 99; R-Reply, on Minnotte, \u00b6 9.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 130.\n\nR-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 3.\n\n482.\n\nIn addition, so says the Respondent, the Claimants did nothing to independently verify the authenticity of the disputed documents when allegations of forgery were first uttered in 2009 and \"deliberately chose not to address this issue\".755 The Claimants deliberately closed their eyes to a number of red flags, which should have alerted them to \"the very probable fact of forgery\".756 Therefore, the Claimants should not be entitled to raise any \"additional claims\" against the Respondent.757\n\nR-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 13; R-PHB1, \u00b6 101.\n\nR-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 14.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 104.\n\n483.\n\nFinally, the Respondent considers that the alternative legal theories invoked by the Claimants, namely estoppel, acquiescence, legitimate expectations, unjust enrichment, and international wrongful composite act, have no merit.758 According to the Respondent, the evidence at the hearing \"effectively precludes Claimants from meeting the legal criteria applicable\" under these theories.759\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 80.\n\nR-PHB1, \u00b6 80.\n\n484.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants reply that a finding of forgery would not be dismissive of the entire case. The effect of a finding of forgery on the validity of the exploitation licenses would still need to be determined.760 The Claimants consider these licenses to be \"stand-alone administrative acts\" that \"perfected title\" to the EKCP,761 and are therefore \"*prima facie* lawful and efficacious\".762 The Claimants further argue that, even if the Tribunal held that the exploitation upgrades were invalid, it would have to decide which of the claims remain unaffected.\n\nC-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 6.\n\nTr.

To the contrary, they \"responded quickly and effectively to every indication of forgery or fraud that was brought to their attention\"; they held meetings with and requested comments from Ridlatama, met with the then-Regent Mr. Noor, and cooperated with the Bawasda investigation, which ultimately concluded that the Ridlatama licenses were \"legal and accountable\".765 Because the acts of fraud and forgery are not their own and they are *bona fide* investors, the Claimants assert that they \"should be able to have their claims against the State heard\".766\n\nC-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 2.\n\nEmphasis in the original.

Assessment**\n-----------------\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal will first set out the applicable legal framework (2.1) and then discuss the admissibility of the claims (2.2).\n\n2.1. **Applicable legal framework**\n-----------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the BITs contain substantive provisions addressing the consequences of unlawful conduct by a claimant or its business associate during the performance of an investment. The BITs only contain admission requirements applying at the time of establishment of an investment, which are jurisdictional in nature. Therefore, the Tribunal will have recourse to principles of international law to determine the consequences of the forgeries established above.\n\n489.\n\nAs stated in *Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela,* all systems of law, including the international legal system, contain concepts designed to avoid misuse of the law.770 With respect to international investment arbitration and ICSID proceedings more specifically, the tribunal in *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* insisted on the duty of arbitral tribunals not to protect an abuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention or bilateral investment treaties.771\n\n*Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, \u00b6 167.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6 144 (**Exh. RLA-060** **;**  **Exh. CLA-253**).\n\n490.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Europe Cement v. Turkey* stated that \"conduct that involves fraud and an abuse of process deserves condemnation\".772 Likewise, the tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana* held that no protection is afforded to investments made in violation of \"national or international principles of good faith\", such as corruption, fraud or deceitful conduct, even absent any specific legality requirement in the BIT:\n\n\"An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if its creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the host State\u2019s law\".773\n\nAnd the tribunal added:\n\n\"These are general principles that exist independently of specific language to this effect in the Treaty\".774\n\n*Europe Cement Investment and Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2, Award, 13 August 2009, \u00b6 180 (**Exh. RLA-147**).\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6 123 (**Exh. RlA-058**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 124.\n\n491.\n\nAs the quotation of *Hamester* just illustrated, international tribunals have found fraudulent behavior to breach the principle of good faith, to constitute an abuse of right or, under certain circumstances, an abuse of process.775 Various tribunals have underlined the fundamental nature and the longstanding recognition of the principle of good faith as a matter of domestic and international law, including investment law.776\n\n*See*, for instance: *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006 (**Exh. RLA-056**) ; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, \u00b6 139 (**Exh. RLA-059**) ; *Europe Cement Investment and Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARb(aF)/07/2, Award, 13 August 2009 (**Exh. RLA-147**) ; *Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v. Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010 (**Exh. RLA-156**) ; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00b6 127 (**Exh. RLA-155** **;**  **Exh. CLA-228**).\n\n*See*, for instance: *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, \u00b6 230 (**Exh. RLA-056**) ; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6 144 (**Exh. RLA-060** **;**  **Exh. CLA-253**) ; *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6 123 (**Exh. RLA-058**) ; *Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, \u00b6 116 (**Exh. RlA-269**) ; *Abaclat and Others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2011, \u00b6 646.\n\n492.\n\nThe theory of abuse of process, which is a variation of the prohibition of abuse of rights and, like the latter, an emanation of the principle of good faith also found application in the context of inadmissible corporate restructurings. That theory is another manifestation of the general principle that one does not benefit from treaty protection when underlying conduct is deemed improper. For instance, the tribunal in *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy v. Peru* held the claimants\u2019 attempts to establish jurisdiction on the basis of \"untrustworthy, if not utterly misleading\" documents amounted to an abuse of process precluding the tribunal's exercise of its jurisdiction over the dispute.777\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195. *See* also, for instance: *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 585.\n\n493.\n\nMoreover, particularly serious cases of fraudulent conduct, such as corruption, have been held to be contrary to international or transnational public policy.778 The common law doctrine of unclean hands barring claims based on illegal conduct has also found expression at the international level, although its status and exact contours are subject to debate and have been approached differently by international tribunals.779\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 139, 161, 192(1) (**Exh. RLA-077**) ; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00b6 292 (**Exh. RLA-155** **;**  **Exh. CLA-228**). *See* also: *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, \u00b6 246 (**Exh. RLA-056**).\n\n*See*, for instance, the view of the majority in *Hesham Talaat M. Al-Warraq v. Indonesia,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 15 December 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 645-646; and compare with \u00b6 683, note 217. Compare also with: *Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh et al.,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 and ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013, \u00b6 477 *;* *Guyana v. Suriname,* PCA, Award, 17 September 2007, \u00b6 418.\n\n494.\n\nThe legal consequences of fraudulent conduct depend to a large extent on the circumstances of each case, which may include the applicable treaty, the seriousness of the fraud, the role of the disputing parties or third parties in relation to the fraud, the nexus between the fraud and the claims, and the time when the fraud was committed. A review of international cases shows that fraudulent conduct can affect the jurisdiction of the tribunal, or the admissibility of (all or some) claims, or the merits of a dispute.780\n\n*See*, for instance: *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 127, 129 (**Exh. RLA-058**) ; *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 192, 266, 271 (**Exh. RLA-210**).\n\n495.\n\nIn *Phoenix v. Czech Republic,* the tribunal stated that \"States cannot be deemed to offer access to ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments not made in good faith\" and thus held that it lacked jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the Israeli-Czech BIT.781\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 106, 145 (**Exh. RLA-060** **;**  **Exh. CLA-253**).\n\n496.\n\nIn *Inceysa v. El Salvador,* the tribunal held that access to international arbitration was barred where investments were secured through fraud.782 It also affirmed the existence of a \"meta-positive provision\" prohibiting the attribution of effects to \"an act done illegally\"783 and ultimately held that it lacked jurisdiction since the claimant had acted improperly in the bidding process leading to the investment.784\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, \u00b6 242 (**Exh. RLA-056**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 248.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 339(2).\n\n497.\n\nIn *Europe Cement v. Turkey,* the tribunal deemed the copies purportedly supporting the ownership of share certificates to be fraudulent and denied jurisdiction because the claimant failed to provide originals:\n\n\"In the present case, the Tribunal has concluded that the claim to ownership of shares in CEAS and Kepez was based on documents that on examination appear to have been backdated and thus fraudulent. Since the Claimant either had no original documents to produce or no intention of producing original documents because they would not withstand forensic examination, the continual requests for extensions of time for over a five month period could only be seen as a cynical attempt to postpone the inevitable, further contributing to the abuse of process\".785\n\n*Europe Cement Investment and Trade S.A. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/2, Award, 13 August 2009, \u00b6 180 (**Exh. RLA-147**).\n\n498.\n\nOther tribunals dealt with fraudulent conduct as a matter of admissibility. In *Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria*, for instance, the arbitral tribunal was confronted with a \"deliberate concealment amounting to fraud\" in the making of the investment. It held that the Energy Charter Treaty \"should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the aim of encouraging respect for the rule of law\" and concluded that the treaty\u2019s substantive protections \"cannot apply to investments that are made contrary to law\".786 It therefore held the claims inadmissible.787\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 135, 139 (**Exh. RLA-059**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 146.\n\n499.\n\nFinally, a number of tribunals have treated fraudulent conduct in the course of the assessment of the merits. In *Cementownia v. Turkey*, the tribunal dismissed all claims as amounting to an abuse of right compounded by an abuse of process through procedural misconduct.788\n\n*Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2, Award, 17 September 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 156-159 (**Exh. RLA-170**).\n\n500.\n\nIn *Malicorp v. Egypt,* the respondent argued that the claimant could not benefit from investment protection since it had entered into a contract based on forgery. The tribunal dismissed the claims on the merits, because the contract had been concluded on the basis of a mistake.789 It considered that conduct contrary to good faith, such as a \"veritable abuse of the law\", undermines the substantive rights of the investor as well as his right to arbitrate the dispute.790\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 130,136-137 (**Exh. RLA-269**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 116.\n\n501.\n\nIn *Minnotte v. Poland,* the tribunal held that, notwithstanding the absence of an express legality requirement in the BIT, \"it is now generally accepted that investments made on the basis of fraudulent conduct cannot benefit from BIT protection\".791 In that case, the respondent had failed to provide evidence of \"deliberate fraud on the part of the Claimants\". Therefore, the tribunal assessed whether its jurisdiction was vitiated \"by reason of the alleged negligent failure of the Claimants to investigate the factual circumstances surrounding the making of their investment\".792 The tribunal rejected the proposition that principles of international law, such as *ex turpi causa non oritur actio*, barred jurisdiction in the event of \"a negligent failure to make inquiries which might (or might not) have unearthed evidence of fraud\".793\n\n*David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v. Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/10/1, Award, 16 May 2014, \u00b6 131 (**Exh. CLA-255**).\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 135, 137.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 139.\n\n502.\n\nHowever, on the merits, the *Minnotte* tribunal contemplated the possibility that a claim may be vitiated where the claimant unreasonably failed to perceive evidence of serious misconduct or crime by a third party:\n\n\"There may be circumstances in which the deliberate closing of eyes to evidence of serious misconduct or crime, or an unreasonable failure to perceive such evidence, would indeed vitiate a claim\".794\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 163.\n\n503.\n\nThe Claimants suggested, and the Respondent did not object, that in an admissibility context *Minnotte* spells out a three-step analytical inquiry of whether a wrongdoing was committed by a third party, whether that wrongdoing is connected to the investor\u2019s claims, and the \"nature of this connection and the extent to which it impacts upon the investor\u2019s good faith\".795 The Parties further agreed that the standard of willful blindness sheds light on the meaning of \"deliberate closing of eyes\" or \"unreasonable failure to perceive\", although the Respondent sees no justification in investor-State arbitration in having resort to American criminal law doctrines of willful blindness.796\n\nC-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 4; R-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 4.\n\nC-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 17; R-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 11.\n\n504.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the passage in *Minnotte* quoted above addresses the so-called \"head-in-the-sand problem\", also sometimes referred to as \"Nelsonian knowledge\", where a claimant knew or should have known of third-party wrongdoing in connection with an investment and still chose to do nothing (as opposed to just failing to take due care). Considering the specific circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal will assess the standard of willful blindness - also referred to as \"conscious disregard\" or \"deliberate ignorance\" - by focusing on the level of institutional control and oversight deployed by the Claimants in relation to the licensing process, whether the Claimants were put on notice by evidence of fraud that a reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector should have investigated, and whether or not they took appropriate corrective steps.\n\n505.\n\nOther cases denied protection to investments tainted by the fraud of a third party, be it under the heading of jurisdiction, admissibility or merits. For instance, in *Anderson v. Costa Rica*, the tribunal denied jurisdiction for lack of an investment, since the assets acquired by the claimant had been secured by a third party that had engaged in \"aggravated fraud and illegal financial intermediation\".797\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v. Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 55, 59 (**Exh. RLA-156**).\n\n506.\n\nInvestment tribunals also held that investors must exercise a reasonable level of due diligence, especially when investing in risky business environments. In *Anderson v. Costa Rica,* for instance, the tribunal stated that \"prudent investment practice requires that any investor exercise due diligence before committing funds to any particular investment proposal\".798 The scope of the due diligence depends on the particular circumstances of each case, such as the general business environment,799 and includes ensuring that a proposed investment complies with local laws,800 as well as investigating the reliability of a business partner and that partner's representations before deciding to invest.801\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 58.\n\n*Eudoro Armando Olgu\u00edn v.

Inadmissibility of claims related to the EKCP**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nOn the basis of the facts discussed above, the Tribunal found that a fraudulent scheme permeated the Claimants' investments in the EKCP. As the Respondent correctly put it, the forgeries of the disputed document were \"essential to the making and conduct of the EKCP from which all of the Claimants' claims arise\".802 The question is thus whether, on the ground of the legal principles just set forth, the claims can still deserve protection or whether they must be dismissed. The Tribunal views this question as a matter of admissibility. Indeed, if it dismisses the claims, it will do so on the ground of a threshold bar, without entering into an analysis of the alleged treaty violations.\n\nR-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 4.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that claims arising from rights based on fraud or forgery which a claimant deliberately or unreasonably ignored are inadmissible as a matter of international public policy.803 For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants' contention that they conducted \"extensive\" and \"exhaustive\" due diligence in verifying the authenticity of the disputed mining licenses, both when the licenses were purportedly issued and when forgery allegations were first brought to their attention.\n\nR-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 41.\n\n509.\n\nIn reviewing the circumstances of their case in light of the legal standards set out above, the Tribunal is struck by the seriousness of the fraud that taints the entire EKCP (a) and by the Claimants\u2019 lack of diligence overseeing the licensing process and investigating allegations of forgery (b).\n\na) The seriousness of the forgeries and fraud\n---------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nThe facts established above reveal the existence of a large scale fraudulent scheme implemented to obtain four coal mining concession areas in the EKCP. The forgeries are directly linked to the claims raised by the Claimants which all relate to the EKCP. The record contains 34 forged documents including ten mining licenses and four decrees purporting to re-enact the revoked Exploitation Licenses. With the exception of four of these forged documents,804 all of them were filed by the Claimants in support of their case.\n\nThe PT RTM Recommendation Letter was obtained by the Indonesian police during the raid of PT ICD\u2019s office on 29 August 2014 and was filed by the Respondent. Recommendation No. 522.21/5213/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of Forestry, dated 29 December 2009, regarding Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (**Exh. R-144**). *See* further: Letter from the Respondent dated 11 March 2015 l, p. 2; Letter from the Tribunal dated 20 March 2015, p. 2. The PT RTP Recommendation Letter was produced by the Claimants and filed by the Respondent as a result of the document production phase. *See* : Procedural Order No. 16, Annex B, DPR No. 35; Recommendation No. 522.21/5214/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimanatan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of Forestry, dated 29 December 2009, regarding Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (**Exh. R-145**). The Gunter Documents (documents nos. 33 and 34 in the Document Table) were produced by the Claimants on 27 July 2015 and filed by the Respondent. *See* : Respondent\u2019s email of 30 July 2015 ; Claimants\u2019 email of 30 July 2015.\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that the scheme was put in place intentionally. The record shows repeated acts of forgery, starting with the fabrication of the Survey and Exploration Licenses to gain access to the coal reserves. The record also shows that Ridlatama sent copies of these licenses to \"affected governmental departments\" so as to \"ensure that our licenses were officially recognized at all government levels\".805 By doing so, a fa\u00e7ade was built that would provide legitimacy to an illegal enterprise.806 As a final step in that enterprise, the Re-Enactment Decrees evince an intention to perpetuate the fraud and further mislead affected parties.\n\nBenjamin WS1, \u00b6 15(b). *See* also: Quinlivan WS1, \u00b6 41; Tr. (Day 6), 12:23-13:6 (Cross, Quinlivan); C-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 13.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants\u2019 reliance on acknowledgements of receipt and maps generated by the MEMR, obtained on request of Ridlatama, is to no avail. Indeed, the licensing process for mining in East Kutai was within the competence of the Regency at the relevant time, not the MEMR. In addition, the MEMR did not have the necessary procedures to verify the existence of overlapping concession areas or to validate information received from license holders prior to the institution of the \"Clean and Clear\" program in 2010. The Tribunal further notes that the MEMR maps on which the Claimants rely reveal various oddities, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that they are unreliable. For instance, the 21 May 2008 map shows the PT RP tenement with an exploration status, although no exploration upgrade had been requested by Ridlatama for that area. Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Map of Kutai Mining Area, 21 May 2008 (**Exh. C-105**). *See* also: R-PHB1, \u00b6 48, item 1; R-Reply on Minnotte, \u00b6 10, item 6. *See* further: Quinlivan WS1, \u00b6 26; Hardwick WS, note 8.\n\n512.\n\nThe facts suggest that the motive driving the fraud was to extend Ridlatama's mining rights in the EKCP beyond the unpromising tenements of PT RP and PT RS, and especially to access the PT RTM block which contains 95% of the coal reserves discovered in the EKCP.807 To this end, forged licenses and related documents were fabricated to give an impression of lawful entitlement. That false impression was then used to obtain hand-signed Exploitation Licenses issued on the misguided assumption that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights. The fraud was then later perpetuated with the forgery of the Re-Enactment Decrees after the Exploitation Licenses had been revoked.\n\nQuinlivan WS1, \u00b6 27.\n\n513.\n\nThe following facts confirm the motivation behind the forgery. The Sendawar project that preceded the EKCP, in which Churchill and Planet, through PT ICD, first partnered with Ridlatama in 2006, was unsuccessful.808 The surveys in the concession areas of PT RP and PT RS, the first two tenements of the EKCP for which Ridlatama obtained valid and undisputed licenses, were also disappointing. As a consequence, Ridlatama never applied for exploration licenses for these blocks.809\n\nQuinlivan WS1, \u00b6 15; Hardwick WS, \u00b6 13.\n\nQuinlivan WS1, \u00b6 26; Hardwick WS, note 8.\n\n514.\n\nThe circumstances of the initial field work in the PT RP block are particularly telling. Ridlatama conducted this work in the \"nose\"810 or \"beak\"811 of what Mr. Quinlivan called the \"bird tenement\",812 i.e. the northern part of the PT RP mining area. It concentrated on the southern border of the beak along a stream of coal reserves extending southwards into the concession area held by Kaltim Nusantara Coal.813 That concession later became the block of PT RTM, an area that contains huge coal reserves. Thus, contrary to Mr. Quinlivan\u2019s statement, the areas to the south of the beak were not an \"empty bank\" or a \"moose pasture\".814 In other words, the fraud was designed to gain access to the coal reserves located in the areas to the south of the beak of the PT RP mining area.\n\nTr.

(Day 7), 45:16-24, 46:16-19 (Cross, Gunter).\n\nQuinlivan WS3, \u00b6 10.\n\n515.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the acts of forgery brought to light in these proceedings are of a particularly serious nature in light of the number and nature of forged documents and of the aim pursued, namely to orchestrate, legitimize and perpetuate a fraudulent scheme to gain access to valuable mining rights.\n\nb) The Claimants\u2019 lack of diligence\n-----------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe seriousness of the fraud just discussed is compounded by the Claimants\u2019 lack of diligence, which is evidenced by the following facts.\n\n517.\n\nFirst, the Claimants were aware of the risks involved in investing in the coal mining industry in Indonesia. Indeed, as Mr. Quinlivan confirmed at the hearing, the Claimants knew that investing in the coal mining sector in Indonesia entailed serious risks.815 According to Mr. Quinlivan, Churchill was aware of the risks resulting from the disorganization in governmental agencies, in particular due to the devolution of power in the context of decentralization since 2001 and to the absence of experienced staff in the Regency administering mining activities.816 Mr. Quinlivan qualified the situation in the Regencies as resembling the \"Wild West\".817 He also confirmed that Churchill was aware of the risk of overlapping mining licenses.818 Churchill was moreover well aware of the \"endemic problem\" of corruption in the Indonesian mining sector. Mr. Quinlivan regarded corruption as an \"acceptable risk\", and insisted that, as a publicly listed company, Churchill was unwilling to engage in such practices.819\n\nTr. (Day 5), 160:13-15 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 14:7-10, 15:4-7 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 15:8-19 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 14:24-15:3 (Cross, Quinlivan). Mr. Gunter mentioned the existence of 5000 overlapping licenses in Indonesia. Tr. (Day 7), 31:9-14 (Cross, Gunter). *See* also: C-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 12.\n\nTr. (Day 5), 179:10-19, 179:23-180:1 (Cross, Quinlivan); Tr. (Day 6), 69:11-14 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\n518.\n\nSecond, one would expect an investor aware of the risks of investing in a certain environment to be particularly diligent in investigating the circumstances of its investment. Yet, the Claimants did not engage in proper due diligence in their dealings with their partners. In particular, they failed to exert due diligence when choosing Ridlatama. Mr. Quinlivan stated that he relied on Mr. Mazak's judgment and did not investigate the reliability of that company and its directors.820 Mr. Kurniawan, for his part, testified that in 2007 Ridlatama only had a small shop in Jakarta with no proper infrastructure or staff in East Kutai.821 It further appears that the Claimants chose their partners essentially because of Ridlatama's alleged \"good connections\" with government officials, in particular in the Mining and Energy Bureau of the Regency.822 Mr. Kurniawan indeed stated that he was hired by Ridlatama because he \"knew many officials in the local government\",823 having previously been a director of a regional company owned by the Regency of East Kutai.824 In addition, there is no evidence on record that the Claimants verified the representations made by Ridlatama.825 While connections with the Government may be a legitimate reason for selecting a business partner, this reason does not dispense with the investor's duty to investigate that partner's reliability, especially in a risky environment.\n\nTr. (Day 5), 183:23-184:15 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 158:20-159:13 (Cross, Kurniawan).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 68:23-69:2, 70:2-5 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nKurniawan WS1, \u00b6 26. *See* also: Tr. (Day 6), 156:18-21 (Cross, Kurniawan).\n\nKurniawan WS1, \u00b6 10.\n\n*See*, for instance: Tr. (Day 6), 70:21-24, 71:10-12 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\n519.\n\nThird, because the environment was risky and because the chosen business partner showed no record of proven reliability, one would expect the investor to exercise a heightened degree of diligence. This is so in particular in respect of the supervision of the licensing process, since the mining licenses form the indispensable basis of a successful investment. However, the record shows that the Claimants\u2019 supervision of the licensing process was deficient in several aspects. For instance, Mr. Benjamin, who became Director of PT ICD in July 2007, stated that he relied upon the information given to him by Ridlatama, believed that what Ridlatama conveyed was true, and never took independent steps to ascertain the veracity of such information.826 Mr. Quinlivan also stated that he relied on, and did not double check, Ridlatama\u2019s representations that the Nusantara licenses had expired or that Ridlatama had confirmed in a meeting with Nusantara that the latter no longer held an interest in the EKCP.827 He also relied on Mr. Kurniawan\u2019s information that the disputed licenses had been hand-delivered by the Regent during official ceremonies.828\n\nTr. (Day 7), 86:24-87:10 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 62:12-16, 64:9-11 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 20:22-25, 35:25-36:5, 39:9-10 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\n520.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Benjamin stated that prior to his arrival no one within PT ICD performed any oversight function in relation to licensing or permitting during the application process for the mining rights for PT RTM and PT RTP in 2007:\n\n\"Q. [...] Who within PT ICD was responsible for performing the oversight function that you came to assume in relation to licensing or permitting?\n\nA. At that time no one of PT ICD was actually responsible for the obtaining of those licenses mentioned.\n\nQ. Was there anyone within PT ICD who performed the coordination or oversight function that you came to assume?\n\nA. Not that I can think of\".829\n\nTr. (Day 7), 87:16-24 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\n521.\n\nMoreover, although Mr. Benjamin was the person at PT ICD responsible for the oversight of the licensing process, he said that he only received copies of the licenses and did not otherwise seek to verify whether the licenses were properly signed or stamped:\n\n\"Q. Did there come a time when you realized that the signatures on the general survey licenses, and on the exploration licenses, purporting to be handwritten signatures of Mr. Ishak, were identical?\n\nA. I only received the copies of those documents and I didn't pay attention whether it's stamped or whatever. It was just a document\".830\n\nAnd further:\n\n\"Q. Okay. Can you tell me what, if anything, you did while you were employed by ICD to ascertain whether the signatures of Mr. Ishak appearing on those licenses were identical.\n\nA. I never take any effort or time to look at the signatures or compare signatures between documents\".831\n\nTr. (Day 7), 90:22-91:3 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 96:7-12 (Cross, Benjamin).\n\n522.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants did not seek to ascertain the means of signing mining licenses in Indonesia. Mr. Quinlivan stated that \"[w]e didn't know how Bupati [i.e., the Regent] or various people fit their signatures to various documents\",832 although that information would have been readily available. Indeed, Messrs. Benjamin and Gunter testified that they would have been very concerned had they known that the licenses were not hand-signed by Mr. Ishak, which shows that they knew that mining licenses were hand-signed.833\n\nTr. (Day 6), 20:8-10 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 97:1-19 (Cross, Benjamin); Tr. (Day 7), 35:81-12 (Cross, Gunter).\n\n523.\n\nIn the same vein, the Claimants' conduct was not diligent in ensuring that Nusantara was no longer interested in its mining rights. Although the Claimants stated that Mr. Gunter had verified that Nusantara's licenses had expired,834 he testified that his company GMT \"was not involved at all in checking on the Nusantara licenses\".835 Mr. Quinlivan further stated that Ridlatama had sought and obtained assurances from Nusantara in June 2007 that it had no interest in the mining rights anymore. However, seeking such assurances in June when the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses had been issued in May makes no sense, if the disputed licenses had been validly issued.836 Mr. Quinlivan's explanation that the meeting took place to \"make sure that there was no issues with these licenses\" \"that were granted\" is hardly convincing.837 At best, it shows an awareness of possible issues that should have led to increased caution.\n\n*See*, for instance: Hardwick WS, \u00b6 17(b).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 41:16-42:9 (Cross, Gunter).\n\nQuinlivan WS1, \u00b6 29.\n\nMr. Quinlivan provided the following response:  \n \"Q. Why did that meeting take place after the licenses had been granted?  \n A. It was, I guess, to make sure that there was no issues with these licenses over this ground, which we understood to have the license over which had expired, so that there would be no complications with the licenses that were granted\". Tr. (Day 6), 63:23-64:4 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\n524.\n\nFourth, the Claimants failed to exercise due diligence when \"indications of forgery\" first came to light in the BPK report of 23 February 2009.838 Mr. Quinlivan gave evidence that he relied on Ridlatama\u2019s representations that there was no merit to the \"indications of forgery\", as well as on the police report dated 6 May 2009, the Bawasda report dated 18 March 2010, the due diligence conducted by the law firm Sondang Tampubolon & Partners (\"STP\") in 2007, and Mr. Kurniawan\u2019s account of the Regent handing over the mining licenses in person.839 On this basis, he reached the conclusion that the \"indications of forgery\" were \"not an issue\".840The Claimants also pointed to an evaluation report of 2 October 2009 of the BPK report which first raised the issue of indications of forgery,841 the assessment conducted by DNC Advocates (\"DNC\") in 2010 on the instruction of Hari Kiran Vadlamani, a shareholder of Churchill,842 as well as the due diligence conducted by Mr. Soehandjono in 2011.843\n\nReport No. 20/LHP/XVII/02/2009 dated 23 February 2009 on Result of Audit (Audit with Specific Purpose) Semester II Budget Year 2008 over Management of Coal Mining Budget Year 2006 and 2007 at the Government of the Regency of East Kutai and Holders of Mining Authorization in Sangatta (**Exh.

C-519**).\n\n525.\n\nHowever, none of these elements warranted Mr. Quinlivan\u2019s conclusion that there was no issue with the \"indications of forgery\". The reliability of Ridlatama\u2019s affirmations was not established. The police report only related to allegations of illegal trespass and did not assess the authenticity of the disputed licenses through forensic analysis.844 Bawasda's mandate was revoked after Ridlatama had proposed that Bawasda conduct its inspection in Ridlatama's office in Jakarta and offered to pay all travel expenses.845 In any event, Bawasda was only to assess the overlaps between the licenses of Ridlatama and Nusantara.\n\nEast Kutai Police, Advice of Investigation Process, SP2HP/33/V/2009/Reskrim, 6 May 2009 (**Exh.

(Day 6), 33:10-23 (Cross, Quinlivan).\n\n526.\n\nFurther, the due diligence of STP was conducted in 2007, two years prior to the \"indications of forgeries\". That law firm did not assess the authenticity of the disputed signatures,846 but instead verified if all the steps of the application process had been followed to reach the conclusion that the Ridlatama licenses were \"valid, unencumbered, and legally enforceable in Indonesia\".847 In addition, although Mr. Benjamin stated that STP had been recommended by PT ICD, it was hired by Ridlatama to conduct that diligence.848\n\nTr. (Day 6), 11:12-24 (Cross, Quinlivan). In addition, the Respondent correctly pointed out that it is unclear which version of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, i.e. the version with autopen signatures (documents nos. 1 and 2 in the Document Table) or the version with copy and paste signatures (documents nos. 33 and 34 in the Document Table), was provided to STP. R-Comments on Minnotte, \u00b6 16, 2nd item.\n\nMr. Benjamin provided the following testimony:  \n \"Q. Did you talk to the Sondang law firm about the examination they conducted of the signatures?  \n A. No.  \n Q. Did you have any basis to think that they had performed a forensic analysis or comparison of the signatures on the licenses?  \n A. No\". Tr. (Day 7), 95:17-23 (Cross, Benjamin). *See* further: Legal Opinions prepared by Sondang Tampubolon & Partners for PT RTP, PT RTM, PT INP and PT IR dated 30 January 2008 (**Exh. C-72 to C-75**).\n\nTr. (Day 7), 93:14-15 (Cross, Benjamin). In this context, the Tribunal notes that the due diligence conducted by Mr. Soehandjono in 2011 is not relevant to assess the Claimants' level of diligence prior to May 2010. Mr. Soehandjono's EKCP Development Illustration Map and Legal Conclusions, 2011 (**Exh. C-519**). The same applies to the due diligence conducted by DNC on behest of Mr. Vadlamani in June 2010. The Tribunal also notes that the DNC draft reports did not consist of any forensic analysis of the disputed signatures. *See* : Draft Legal Due Diligence Report for PT RTM prepared by DNC, 25 June 2010 (**Exh. C-474**) ; Draft Legal Due Diligence Report for PT RTP prepared by DNC, 25 June 2010 (**Exh. C-475**) ; Draft Legal Due Diligence Report for PT IR prepared by DNC, 25 June 2010 (**Exh. C-476**) ; Draft Legal Due Diligence Report for PT INP prepared by DNC, 25 June 2010 (**Exh. C-477**).\n\n527.\n\nFinally, the Claimants\u2019 absence of diligence became apparent in the present proceedings when they filed or produced 34 forged documents to support their claims. These notably included two different versions of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses and the \"copy and paste\" signatures in the Gunter Documents that were provided to Mr. Gunter by Mr. Mazak849 and must therefore have been in the archives of PT ICD. In fact, the record reveals that the first time the Claimants engaged in their own forensic assessment of the disputed signatures was through its expert Dr. Strach for the purposes of the present arbitration.850\n\nTr. (Day 7), 23:1-3, 15-17 (Cross, Gunter).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the evaluation report of 2 October 2009, which analyzes the BPK report did not involve a forensic assessment of the disputed signatures, although the BPK report specifically raised the issue of identical signatures. Instead, the evaluation focused on translation issues, discrepancies in registration numbers and irregularities in maps. Analysis and Evaluation Report of the BPK Report by the Ridlatama Group, 2 October 2009 (**Exh. C-516**). *See* further: BPK Audit Report on the Management of Coal Mining for the Fiscal Years of 2006 and 2007 at the Regional Government of Kutai Timur and License Area in Sangatta, 23 February 2009, pp. 4-5 (**Exh. C-145**). The Tribunal also notes that the due diligence conducted by Mr. Soehandjono in 2011 consists of an illustration map depicting the licensing process and did not consist of a forensic analysis of the signatures of the disputed documents. Mr. Soehandjono\u2019s EKCP Development Illustration Map and Legal Conclusions, 2011 (**Exh. C-519**).\n\n**D. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n528.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal cannot but hold that all the claims before it are inadmissible. This conclusion derives from the facts analyzed above, which demonstrate that the claims are based on documents forged to implement a fraud aimed at obtaining mining rights. The author of the forgeries and fraud is not positively identified (although indications in the record all point to Ridlatama possibly with the assistance of a Regency insider). Notwithstanding, the seriousness, sophistication and scope of the scheme are such that the fraud taints the entirety of the Claimants\u2019 investment in the EKCP. As a result, the general principle of good faith and the prohibition of abuse of process entail that the claims before this Tribunal cannot benefit from investment protection under the Treaties and are, consequently, deemed inadmissible.\n\n529.\n\nThe inadmissibility applies to all the claims raised in this arbitration, because the entire EKCP project is an illegal enterprise affected by multiple forgeries and all claims relate to the EKCP. This is further supported by the Claimants\u2019 lack of diligence in carrying out their investment.\n\n530.\n\nThe conclusion reached by the Tribunal is within the scope of the present phase of the arbitration as it was circumscribed in Procedural Orders Nos. 13, 15 and 20. In this context, the Tribunal notes in particular that it arrived at this outcome without there being a need to address the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian law (see above paragraphs 232-233).851 Indeed, whatever their validity under municipal law, the Exploitation Licenses were embedded in a fraudulent scheme, being surrounded by forgeries. Forged documents preceded and followed them in time with the Re-Enactment Decrees, which under a non-authentic signature purported to revoke the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses. The accumulation of forgeries both before and after the Exploitation Licenses show that, irrespective of their lawfulness under local law, the entire EKCP was fraudulent, thereby triggering the inadmissibility of the claims under international law.\n\n*See* also \u00b6 34 of PO15 and \u00b6 28 of PO13.\n\n531.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that, in light of the declaration of inadmissibility of all the claims, it can dispense with ruling on the Claimants' alleged substitute causes of action. Such causes of action exclusively relate to the Claimants' investments in the EKCP. Since the latter are tainted by the fraud, so are the substitute claims by force of consequence.\n\n532.\n\nSince all the claims are held inadmissible, the Tribunal considers that these proceedings have reached their conclusion and therefore turns to the allocation of costs.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n533.\n\nThe Respondent's incurred costs in connection with these proceedings amounting to USD 12,328,704.18, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 11,528,704.18 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 800,000.852 These costs include (i) costs in relation to the Document Authenticity phase of USD 9,627,863.18, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 9,077,863.18 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 550,000,853 and (ii) costs incurred during the jurisdictional phase of USD 2,700,841, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 2,450,841 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 250,000.854\n\nRespondent's Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015; Respondent's Reply to the Claimants' Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015; Letter from Tribunal to the Parties dated 1 December 2016; Email from the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 2 December 2016 (see above note 52). *See* also: Respondent's Costs Submissions of 11 June 2013.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015; Letter from Tribunal to the Parties dated 1 December 2016; Email from the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 2 December 2016 (see above note 52).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 11 June 2013.\n\n534.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with this arbitration. According to the Respondent, ICSID tribunals have, in the exercise of their discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, not strictly adhered to the \"loser pays\" principle, but taken into account a variety of factors, such as the relative success of the Parties\u2019 claims, the good faith of a Party in advancing unsuccessful claims and the Parties\u2019 conduct during the arbitration.855\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, pp. 1-2.\n\n535.\n\nSince the Claimants persisted in asserting claims based on \"obviously forged documents\", without making a \"genuine effort\" to discover the truth in addition to mischaracterizing relevant evidence, the Claimants should bear all the costs of these proceedings.856 In addition to factoring in the \"public relations campaign\" orchestrated by the Claimants against Indonesia, the Respondent calls attention to the following conduct of the Claimants. First, the Claimants deliberately withheld presenting Mr. Mazak as a witness, whom the Respondent characterizes as the person with \"the most direct knowledge of the facts in dispute\".857 Second, they misled the Tribunal and the Respondent in connection with the so-called Kurniawan archive and the non-production of other documents held by Ridlatama.858 Third, the Respondent submits that the Claimants knew all along that the disputed signatures were identical without ever investigating these signatures. In this context, Indonesia argues that the Claimants \"stonewalled\" its efforts to obtain the production of the original versions of the disputed documents.859 Fourth, the Claimants withheld documents from their own expert, Dr. Strach, and refused to let him confer with Mr. Epstein.860 This conduct led to the Respondent having to incur \"significant additional expenses\".861 Finally, the Respondent calls on the Tribunal to reject the Claimants' complaints about Indonesia's conduct during the proceeding.862\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, p. 2; Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, pp. 1-2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, pp. 2-3; Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, p. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, p. 3-6; Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, pp. 6-7; Respondent's Reply to the Claimants' Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply to the Claimants' Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply to the Claimants' Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply to the Claimants' Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, pp. 45.\n\n536.\n\nThe Claimants' total costs amount to USD 4,084,021.34, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 3,284,021.34 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 800,000.863 These costs are split as follows: (i) costs in relation to the Document Authenticity phase of USD 2,198,795, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 1,648,795 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 550,000,864 and (ii) costs during the jurisdictional phase of USD 1,885,226.34, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 1,635,226.34 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 250,000.865\n\n*See* above note 52.\n\nClaimants' Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015; Claimants' Reply to the Respondent's Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015; Claimants' Amended Costs Submissions of 20 April 2016; Claimants' Re-Amended Costs Submissions of 30 May 2016. *See* also above note 52.\n\nClaimants' Costs Submissions of 11 June 2013.\n\n537.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants ask that the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay the Claimants' legal costs of responding to its Application in full, including costs incurred as a result of the Respondent's late payment of the fifth cost advance.866 They further argue that the Respondent's claimed costs are \"extraordinary\".867\n\nClaimants' Re-Amended Costs Submissions, 30 May 2016, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Respondent's Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, \u00b6 10.\n\n538.\n\nWhile acknowledging the Tribunal's discretion to make awards of costs, the Claimants argue that the starting point should be that the costs follow the event868 and that in cases of multiple claims, the Tribunal should weigh the success or failure of each party and allocate costs proportionately to the outcome of the case.869 In applying the principle that costs follow the event, the Claimants further argue that the Tribunal should consider the reasonableness with which the Parties pursued their respective claims and defenses, as well as the Parties\u2019 cooperation in achieving cost effective results.870 On that basis, the Claimants submit that their costs are reasonable \"given the intensity with which the State prosecuted its allegations of forgery, fraud and criminal conversion\".871\n\nClaimants' Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 5.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, \u00b6 2.\n\n539.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional phase, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent \"to pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with the respective arbitration proceedings\", including arbitration costs and the Claimants\u2019 legal and other expenses, \"plus interest accrued thereupon at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment\".872\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 13 March 2013, \u00b6 404 C(1); Claimants\u2019 Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, 30 April 2013, \u00b6 200 C(1). *See* also: Claimants Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, \u00b6 12(a).\n\n540.\n\nWith respect to the Document Authenticity phase, the Claimants argue in the first place that they should be awarded all costs if the Respondent\u2019s Application for Dismissal is dismissed.873 In this context, the Claimants stress that Clifford Chance operated on the basis of a capped fee, although its fees significantly exceeded that cap. Therefore, the Tribunal should not further discount this cost item.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 9.\n\n541.\n\nIn the event that the Respondent\u2019s Application for Dismissal is upheld in full or in part, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should separately consider the Respondent\u2019s two limbs of forgery and fraud.874 As to forgery, the Claimants argue that the Respondent should \"pay (at the very least) a portion\" of the Claimants\u2019 costs if only some of the 34 disputed documents are held to be forged.875 The Tribunal should also consider whether the forgeries occurred with or without wrongdoing on the part of the Claimants.876 As to fraud, the Claimants argue that the Respondent could only succeed in full if the Tribunal were to find that the Exploitation Licenses were obtained through deceit by \"Ridlatama *and the Claimants* \".877 Since they were only victims, so the Claimants argue, the Tribunal should \"make no order as to costs against them\".878\n\nClaimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimants' Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6 13.\n\nEmphasis in the original.

They in particular refer to the document production phase, the refusal of Mr. Noor to attend the hearing, and the variations in the Respondent's case before and after the hearing.880 In any event, the Claimants are of the view that the Tribunal should verify whether there is no unreasonable duplication in the fees of the two law firms that represented Indonesia and whether these fees have actually been paid.881\n\nClaimants' Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 16-25.\n\nClaimants' Costs Submissions of 11 December 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 26-33.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Respondent's Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, \u00b6 12(b).\n\n**B. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n543.\n\nAs a preliminary comment, the Tribunal notes that, whereas the Respondent's submissions on costs of December 2015 include its costs and expenses for the entire arbitration, the Claimants' submissions of December 2015 and April-May 2016 only relate to the Document Authenticity phase. The Tribunal thus also took into consideration cost submissions which the Claimants filed in respect of the jurisdictional stage.\n\n544.\n\nEach side requests that its opponent be ordered to bear the entirety of its own costs and expenses, as well as the entirety of the Tribunal's and the Centre's expenses.\n\n545.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\".\n\n546.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) provides that the Award \"shall contain [...] (j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding\".\n\n547.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 61(2) of the Convention grants the Tribunal discretion in allocating the ICSID arbitration costs and the Parties\u2019 costs, including legal fees.882\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions, 11 December 2015, p. 1; Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Costs Submissions of 23 December 2015, p. 1; Claimants\u2019 Costs Submissions, 11 December 2015, \u00b6 4.\n\n548.\n\nTwo approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals in awarding costs. The first consists in apportioning ICSID costs in equal shares and ruling that each party shall bear its own costs.883 The second applies the principle \"costs follow the event\", such that the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party,884 or that the parties share in the costs proportionately to their success or failure.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, \u00b6 420 (**Exh. RLA-155** **;**  **Exh. CLA-228**) ; *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 327.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 321-322 (**Exh. RLA-059**) ; *ADC Affiliate and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, \u00b6 533.\n\n549.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to adopt the second approach of \"costs follow the event\". Indeed, this is a case where investors started two arbitrations on the basis of a large number of documents that turned out to be forged and revealed a large scale fraudulent scheme. As a result, the Tribunal considers that the costs of these proceedings should fall on the Claimants, subject to the considerations below.\n\n550.\n\nFirst, it is true that the Claimants prevailed on the jurisdictional objections. Accordingly, one might argue that the costs of that phase must be imposed on the Respondent for having raised unsuccessful defenses. The Tribunal does not think so. These proceedings based on forged documents should not have been brought in the first place. Moreover, the objections to jurisdiction raised by Indonesia were far from frivolous. While they were not sustained, they raised legitimate questions about the significance of the BITs, as the Decisions on Jurisdiction show.\n\n551.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is struck by the disparity in the level of expenses incurred by both sides. The Claimants' expenses amount to USD 4,084,021 (including the advances made to ICSID) and the Respondent's expenses amount to USD 12,328,704, i.e. approximately 3 times more (including advances to ICSID). Differences in fee levels between disputing parties are natural as they are a function of a number of variables, including the complexities of each party's case and a series of choices that a party makes in its best judgment in relation to the conduct of the proceedings. Here, Indonesia had the burden of establishing the forgeries and fraudulent scheme on the basis of a factual matrix that was indeed complex. At the same time, the magnitude of the disparity in fees does not appear entirely justified by these elements. One additional factor may lie in the fact that the Claimants' last counsel worked on the basis of a capped fee. Another factor which may have added to the costs of the Respondent may be the poor state of its own archives,885 which made the retrieval of relevant documents difficult, a factor for which the Claimants can certainly not be held accountable.\n\nAs was confirmed by Mr. Ramadani speaking of the archives of the Mining and Energy Bureau. Tr. (Day 4), 145:3-146:3 (Direct, Ramadani).\n\n552.\n\nHaving pondered all of these elements and exercising its discretion in matters of allocation of costs, the Tribunal deems it reasonable that the Claimants pay 75% of the Respondent's expenses incurred in these proceedings. This result may seem harsh to the Claimants considering that they sought to keep their own costs down. Yet, as the foregoing analysis shows, this is a case of forgery and fraud, which in the Tribunal's mind justifies this result.\n\n553.\n\nAs for the direct costs of the proceedings which were funded with the advances paid to ICSID, there is no reason for an abatement and, thus, the Claimants shall bear 100% of these costs.\n\n554.\n\nAs indicated above, the direct costs of the proceeding include (i) the fees and expenses of each Member of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant; (ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as those related to the conduct of document inspections and hearings (e.g., court reporting, audio visual, interpretation, the charges of Maxwell Chambers in connection with hosting the hearings), courier services, as well as estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award; and (iii) ICSID\u2019s administrative fees.\n\n555.\n\nThe direct costs of the proceeding have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the Parties. Once the case account balance has been finalized, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement.\n\n556.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants shall bear the direct costs of these proceedings, i.e. USD 1,600,000 (subject to ICSID\u2019s final financial statement) of which it has already paid USD 800,000. It shall therefore pay to the Respondent USD 800,000 or any lower amount that may arise from ICSID\u2019s final financial statement. Further, the Claimants shall bear 75% of the Respondent\u2019s costs, i.e. USD 8,646,528.\n\n**VI. OPERATIVE PART**\n----------------------\n\n557.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal renders the following decision:\n\n(1) The Decisions on Jurisdiction of 24 February 2014 are incorporated by reference into this Award;\n\n(2) The 34 disputed documents listed in paragraph 108 of this Award are not authentic and unauthorized;\n\n(3) The claims brought in this arbitration are inadmissible;\n\n(4) The Claimants shall bear the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and thus pay to the Respondent USD 800,000 or any lower amount that may arise out of ICSID\u2019s final statement of account;\n\n(5) The Claimants shall bear 75% of the expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with these proceedings and thus pay to the Respondent USD 8,646,528;\n\n(6) All other claims and requests are dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Request for Continued Stay of the Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2017-06-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Request for Continued Stay of the Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n4.\n\nOn the same date, the Parties were informed that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date, and that Ms. Laura Bergamini, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn May 21, 2017, the ICSID Secretariat wrote to the Parties regarding arrangements for the first session.\n\n6.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to confer and agree upon a briefing schedule to address the Applicants' request for stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n7.\n\nBy communications of May 24, 26 and 27, 2017, the Parties transmitted to the Committee an agreed briefing schedule, which included one round of written submissions and oral arguments at the first session of the Committee (to be held on June 20, 2017).\n\n8.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, the Applicants filed their application for continued stay of enforcement of the Award along with exhibit A-47 and legal authorities ALA-23 through ALA-29 (\"**Stay Request**\").\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of May 31, 2017, the Committee took note of the Parties' agreement on the briefing schedule, and decided to hold the first session on June 20, 2017, by telephone conference. In light of the agreed timetable, the Committee also invited the Parties to confirm that they agreed to extend the provisional stay of enforcement and the 30-day time limit set forth in Arbitration Rule 54(2) until the date of the first session.\n\n10.\n\nBy emails of June 1 and 5, 2017, the Parties confirmed that they agreed to extend the provisional stay of enforcement and the time limit for the decision on the Stay Request until June 20, 2017.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of June 4, 2017, the ICSID Secretariat circulated a draft agenda for the first session and a draft Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the conduct of the proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Stay Request along with exhibits R-269 through R-282, legal authorities RLA-272 through RLA-276, and selected exhibits from the arbitration proceedings (\"**Observations**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn June 13, 2017, the Respondent submitted an amended version of the Observations.\n\n14.\n\nOn June 14, 2017, upon request from the State, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted one hard copy of the Observations to the Applicants.\n\n15.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, the Parties filed comments on the draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n16.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the Committee held the first session. The Parties and the Members of the Committee discussed the draft Procedural Order No. 1. Both Parties presented oral pleadings on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, which were recorded.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, having deliberated by telephone call, the Committee ruled that the stay of enforcement was to continue until it issued a final determination on the matter.\n\n18.\n\nThis decision sets out the Committee's final determination on the Stay Request.\n\n**II. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of the Applicants' Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Applicants request that the enforcement of the Award be stayed without conditions pending a decision on the Annulment Application.1\n\nStay Request, \u00b6\u00b6 20 and 3.\n\n20.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, under Article 52(5) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 54(4), ICSID committees enjoy a \"considerable discretion\" in deciding whether the enforcement of an award should be stayed.2 Relying on *Occidental v. Ecuador*, the Applicants claim that committees have \"normally granted\" the stay3 and taken into account the following factors: (i) possible irreparable injury to the award debtor in case of immediate enforcement; (ii) hardship to either party in the event that the stay is continued or lifted; (iii) prospect of prompt enforcement of the award if it is upheld; (iv) strength of the case for or against annulment; and (v) whether there is a dilatory motive underlying the application for annulment.4 Quoting from *Kassardopoulus v. Georgia*, the Applicants argue that the committees aimed at striking the \"proper balance between the interests of the parties in a given case and the legitimate right to enforce the award.\"5\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 8.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 7.\n\n21.\n\nThe Applicants put forward three main arguments in favour of the continuation of the stay: (i) the Annulment Application is *prima facie* serious and made in good faith; (ii) the balance of hardship favours the continuation of the stay; and (iii) the Applicants are willing to provide security.\n\n22.\n\nFirst, the Applicants submit that they are seeking to annul the Award in good faith,6 relying on arguments *prima facie* serious set out in great detail in their lengthy Annulment Application.7 The Applicants deny that their request is dilatory and argue that they have submitted a detailed application for annulment to accelerate the conduct of the proceedings.8\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 10.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 11.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 12.\n\n23.\n\nSecond, according to the Applicants, they will suffer \"catastrophic\" consequences if the stay is lifted.9 Specifically, the Applicants submit that, if the Respondent execute the Award, they will need to enter into voluntary administration (with an impact on their ability to exercise their right to apply for annulment)10 because their current assets include USD346,000, the shareholding in PT ICD, and a corresponding interest in PT ICD's properties (including a landholding in East Kalimantan Province, the \"**Port Land**\").11\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 13.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 16.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 14.\n\n24.\n\nRelying on *Libananco v. Turkey*, the Applicants further argue that, if the stay is continued, the Respondent will suffer no hardship given that, in light of the Applicants' dire financial condition, its position as an award creditor will not deteriorate.12\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 17.\n\n25.\n\nFinally, the Applicants state that, if the Committee is minded to make the stay of enforcement conditional on some form of security, they are \"willing to pledge the Port Land (which has a cost value of USD1,757 million)\" but they are not able to \"offer security in any other form.\"13\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 19.\n\n26.\n\nAt the first session, the Applicants have further argued that, if they were ordered to post a security for the amount of the Award, the Respondent would be placed in a significantly better position than it would have been if annulment proceedings had not been filed. The Committee would *de facto* be ensuring the enforcement of the Award, a task which is not entrusted with it under the Convention.\n\n**B. Summary of the Respondent's Position**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the continuation of the stay be conditional on the posting of a bank guarantee (or other equivalent security) corresponding to the full amount due under the Award.14\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12 and 21.\n\n28.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the circumstances of the case only warrant a conditional stay of enforcement because: (i) the Annulment Application is dilatory and not *prima facie* serious; and (ii) the Respondent will suffer significant prejudice if no security is posted for the whole amount of the Award (while the Applicants will not suffer undue hardship if security is ordered).15\n\nObservations, \u00b6 6.\n\n29.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Applicants have initiated this proceeding in order to delay and avoid compliance with the Award.16 According to the Respondent, the Annulment Application \"is, on its face, frivolous\" and *prima facie* not serious because the Applicants seek *de facto* to wipe out Tribunal's factual findings on forgery.17\n\nObservations, \u00b6 11.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 10.\n\n30.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that, if no security is posted, \"there is an extremely high risk\" that the Applicants will not comply with the Award (because they have \"no money and no source of business\" and it is highly unlikely that their shareholders-investors will pay for the Award).18 Therefore, if the stay is unconditional, the State will be harmed because the Applicants will pay the costs of the annulment proceedings but will not be able to pay the amounts due under the Award.19\n\nObservations, \u00b6 12.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 3.\n\n31.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the offer of the Port Land as a security is inadequate because the land is \"worthless\"20 and \"there is no evidence that the Applicants have any current ownership interest\" in it.21 In any case, the Respondent submits that the offer would be inadequate even if the Port Land were worth US$1,757 million because this value is \"not even close\" to the amount due under the Award.22 Finally, the Respondent argues that, contrary to *Libananco v. Turkey*, the Applicants can post a security for the full amount of the Award without suffering undue hardship because they can be financed by their shareholders (who have been supporting and funding the pursuit of the ICSID claim).23\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13 and 15.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13 to 15.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 15.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 17 to 20.\n\n**III.** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the Convention stipulates that: \"[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"\n\n33.\n\nArbitration Rule 54(4) provides that a request for stay of enforcement \"shall specify the circumstances that require the stay... A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\"\n\n34.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee finds it important to recall that, under the Convention, the award creditor has a right to enforcement. Indeed, Article 53(1) of the Convention makes particularly clear that awards have *res judicata* effect and are immediately enforceable from the date on which the certified copies are dispatched to the parties.24 The award creditor needs to take no further step to secure the award's enforceability besides what is stated at Article 54(2) of the Convention.25 The award debtor must comply with the award. A stay of enforcement is not automatic and, whatever the practice of granting stays might be in the Applicants' eyes,26 a stay must remain exceptional. Article 53(1) of the Convention explains that a stay of enforcement is an exception to the obligation of the parties to \"abide by and comply with the terms of the award.\" The award debtor must apply for a stay and advance the reasons which justify the stay.27 There is no presumption in favor of maintaining the initial provisional stay of enforcement, as noted by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Sempra v. Argentina* referred to by the Respondent.28 If a stay is granted, the award may no more be subject to the enforcement procedure of Article 54 of the Convention until the *ad hoc* committee decides on the application for annulment.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the Convention provides as follows: \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.\"\n\nArticle 54(2) requires the award creditor to prove the authenticity of the award by furnishing the competent court or other authority of a Contracting State with a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General of ICSID.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 8.\n\nArbitration Rule 54(4).\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (March 5, 2009), \u00b6 27.\n\n35.\n\nThe Applicants seek an unconditional stay. The Respondent replies that it does not oppose the continuation of the stay pending the Committee's decision on the Annulment Application \"as long as the Applicants provide proper security for the whole amount of the Award.\"29 Although there is no agreement of the Parties about the stay, insofar as the Respondent recognizes that \"the circumstances warrant a conditional, not unconditional, stay of enforcement,\"30 it is pointless to discuss at length the circumstances which require a stay. Suffice it to note that it is not seriously debated between the Parties that the financial situation of the Applicants is precarious. Churchill declares that it has USD346,000 in its bank accounts in Australia and the United Kingdom. Other assets include 95% shareholding of PT ICD, the Indonesian company through which the Applicants made and operated their investment, as well as a 95 % interest in the Port Land property of PT ICD purchased for USD1,757 million, and the intellectual property worth USD67.95 million which Churchill authored and commissioned for the EKCP coal exploration project.31 Planet has no other asset than a 5% shareholding in PT ICD. In light of these elements, the Applicants stress that, if enforcement was sought today, they would have to seek protection by entering into voluntary administration. The Respondent acknowledges that it is unlikely that the Applicants would comply with the Award in light of their situation.32 The financial situation of the award debtor is a circumstance which may justify a stay if enforcement would have manifestly excessive consequences. This is the case here.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 3.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 6.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 14.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 12.\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties have discussed the good faith and/or dilatory nature of the Application for Annulment. The Applicants say that their Annulment Application is *prima facie* serious and not without basis.33 The Respondent replies that the Annulment Application is frivolous, as shown by the factual determinations made by the Tribunal and inspired by the desire to avoid compliance with the Award.34 This is beyond the point. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Enron v. Argentina* quoted by the Applicants held that \"the Committee must assume that any application for annulment is made in good faith, and that the application for a stay is a justified exercise of the applicant's procedural rights of defence.\"35 As remarked by another *ad hoc* Committee referred to by both Parties,36 these arguments would throw the *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the regularity or the soundness of the reasons of the impugned award, when the Committee's task in this Decision is limited to balancing the consequences of the enforcement of the Award on the Applicants' situation and those of the postponement of the Respondent's right to payment of the Award.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 11.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 7 to 11.\n\n*Enron Corporation Ponderosa Asset, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (October 7, 2008), \u00b6 47.\n\n*Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award (November 12, 2010), \u00b6 26.\n\n37.\n\nThe conditioning of a stay of enforcement is justified when there are legitimate fears of nonenforcement. The State declares that, given the financial situation of the Applicants, there is a reasonable doubt of compliance with the Award. The State requires that the Applicants post security for the entire amount of the Award.37 The Applicants reply that a security for the full amount of the Award would frustrate their right of access to justice, and put the State in a far better position than without annulment proceedings. They also stress that the State's interests are not jeopardized and that there would not be any significant deterioration, should the stay be continued. They add that the State already has the benefits of the survey work which the Applicants effectuated regarding the EKCP project.38\n\nObservations, \u00b6 12.\n\nStay Request, \u00b6\u00b6 17 and 18.\n\n38.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Applicants that their access to justice cannot be frustrated. Access to justice refers here to the right to apply for annulment provided by Article 52 of the Convention. Such right cannot be impaired by the conditions imposed for the continuation of the stay. A balanced approach between the right of access to justice on the one hand and the right to enforcement on the other must be effectuated by *ad hoc* committees. The Applicants contend that the conditions for the stay should not improve the situation of the Respondent which would be the case if the security were to cover the whole amount of the Award. The Committee observes that, on a general plane, the better position which the award creditor obtains by conditioning the stay is made possible by the award debtor having requested a stay of enforcement in the first place. Besides, the pro-enforcement policy of the Convention expressed in Article 54 of the Convention is another advantage given to the award creditor. Additionally, contrary to what the Applicants proclaim, the Committee would not more be involved in the enforcement of the Award by ordering the posting of security than it is already in deciding on the deferring payment of the Award pursuant to the Stay Request.\n\n39.\n\nThe need for posting security must be ascertained in relation to securing an effective enforcement of the award. The Applicants' financial weakness is not an excuse for non-payment of the Award. However, a guarantee of the entire amount of the Award would be too onerous for the Applicants in light of their financial situation. The Respondent points to the wealthy shareholders of Churchill who, the Respondent says, are able to provide a security for the full amount of the Award.39 There is no reason however to pierce the corporate veil, and there is no contention that the Applicants have voluntarily organized their insolvency to evade their commitment to enforce the Award.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 17 to 19.\n\n40.\n\nThe Applicants propose a pledge on the Port Land property located in the Regency of East Kutai, East Kalimantan Province, as security worth USD1,757 million. Port Land designates the land owned by PT TCUP, a subsidiary of PT ICD, for developing an ocean port coal export facility for the EKCP project. The Respondent avers that the Applicants' ownership interests in Port Land is not demonstrated and that the value of the property amounts to only USD2,000 as mentioned in the Interim Report issued by Churchill for the period July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 released on March 31, 2017.40\n\nChurchill Mining Plc, Interim Report for the Period July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, released on March 31, 2017, Respondent Exhibit R-269.\n\n41.\n\nThe Applicants explain that the Half Year Report for 2016 was prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards and International Accounting Standards Board of the EU and that the writing down of the prize of the Port Land property complies with these accounting rules in light of the revocation of the mining licenses in EKCP and the outcome of the Award. The *ad hoc* Committee regards this explanation concerning the evaluation of the Port Land property as valid. For the above referred accounting reasons, the Port Land property cannot be regarded as worthless by others than Churchill, including the State. The Applicants have also clarified that the Port Land property is owned by PT TCUP, a wholly owned subsidiary of PT ICD, in which Churchill has 95% shares and Planet has the remaining 5%. The Respondent contends that the shares in PT TCUP via PT ICD are worth no more than the Port Land itself. The Applicants however also offer to directly pledge the Port Land property.41\n\nStay Request, \u00b6 19.\n\n42.\n\nThe Committee decides that the latter option of a direct pledge of Port Land is a satisfactory condition for the continuation of the stay until the date on which the Committee issues its decision on the pending Annulment Application submitted by the Applicants. Consequently, the Applicants shall use their best efforts to pledge the Port Land and shall provide an update to the ICSID Secretariat within 15 days. Copy of the pledge shall be notified to the Committee and the ICSID Secretariat within 30 days from the date of this Decision. The stay shall be automatically terminated if the direct pledge of Port Land is not provided for.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n43.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee decides that:\n\na. The stay on enforcement of the Award of December 6, 2016 in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40 will continue pending a decision on the Annulment Application, and subject to the condition set out above of the direct pledge by the Applicants of the Port Land property located in the East Kalimantan Province (Indonesia).\n\nb. If the condition set out above is not complied with, the stay on enforcement shall be automatically terminated.\n\nc.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment (the \"Annulment Application\") of the award rendered on December 6, 2016 (the \"Award\") in the arbitration proceedings (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40) between Churchill Mining Plc and its wholly owned subsidiary, Planet Mining Pty Ltd (\"Churchill\" and \"Planet,\" together, the \"Applicants\" or the \"Claimants\") and the Republic of Indonesia (the \"Respondent\" or the \"State,\" and together with the Applicants, the \"Parties\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Award was rendered by a tribunal composed of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (President), Mr. Michael Hwang S.C. and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg (the \"Tribunal\").\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute in the original proceeding was initially submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated April 27, 1976 (the \"UK-Indonesia BIT\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). Another ICSID proceeding was subsequently initiated on the basis of the ICSID Convention and the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated November 17, 1992 (the \"Australia-Indonesia BIT,\" and together with the UK-Indonesia BIT, the \"BITs\"). The Parties subsequently agreed to join the two proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute related to the East Kutai Coal Project (the \"EKCP\"), a mining project developed by the Applicants through an Indonesian company, PT Indonesian Coal Development (\"PT ICD\") in partnership with a number of Indonesian companies (\"Ridlatama Companies\"), in the Regency of East Kutai on the island of Kalimantan in Indonesia. The Applicants and the Ridlatama Companies decided to focus their activities on the EKCP after a first project in Sendawar had proved unsuccessful. However, the surveys by two of the Ridlatama Companies, PT Ridlatama Steel (\"PT RS\") and PT Ridlatama Power (\"PT RP\") in the area proved equally disappointing with the exception of the southern border of the PT RP block, where the identified coal reserves extended into a concession area held by an Indonesian conglomerate (\"Nusantara\"). Four of the Ridlatama Companies, PT Ridlatama Tambang Power (\"PT RTM\"), PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (\"PT RTP\"), PT Investmine Nusa Persada (\"PT INP\") and PT Investama Resources (\"PT IR\"), applied for mining licenses over this same area on the assumption that the Nusantara's licenses had expired. The regulatory system regarding coal exploration and mining in Indonesia provides for a process of upgrading licenses corresponding to each period of project development, from a general survey business license to an exploration license and then to an exploitation license, which were, according to Churchill and Planet, successively secured by the four Ridlatama Companies on May 24 and November 29, 2007, April 9, 2008, and March 27, 2009. However, the Ridlatama exploitation licences (the \"Exploitation Licenses\") were revoked on May 4, 2010, because the Ridlatama Companies did not have the permits to operate in a forest zone. The Ridlatama Companies unsuccessfully applied to the Indonesian administrative courts for an order quashing the revocation decision.\n\n5.\n\nIn the arbitration, the Applicants claimed protection for their investments in Indonesia, namely (i) their shares and interests in the Indonesian companies through which the EKCP was being carried out, (ii) the mining rights in connection with the EKCP, (iii) the feasibility studies that had been carried out in connection with the EKCP and the intellectual property which had been provided to the local government, (iv) the amounts invested for planning and in preparation of the extraction, and (v) the goodwill in the Indonesian mining services market lost as a result of the State's actions. The Applicants alleged that the State expropriated their investments in breach of its international obligations, failed to accord to them fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") and full protection and security, and failed to ensure that their investments were not impaired by unreasonable and discriminatory measures. The Applicants also brought a claim for denial of justice.\n\n6.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal decided that Churchill and Planet's claims were inadmissible because 34 disputed documents, including the licenses relating to the EKCP, were not authentic and not authorized. The Tribunal also ordered that Churchill and Planet pay the costs and expenses incurred by the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees (for a maximum amount of USD 800,000) and reimburse the State USD 8,646,528 for legal costs and expenses.\n\n7.\n\nThe Applicants have compendiously invoked three grounds for annulment of the Award: (i) that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); (ii) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); and (iii) that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Churchill and Planet filed with ICSID the Annulment Application pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"). The Annulment Application contained a request for the stay of the enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Application and notified the Parties that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n10.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\") was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. Its members are: Judge Dominique Hascher (French), serving as President, Professor Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel (German) and Ms. Jean Kalicki (U.S.). All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to confer and agree upon a briefing schedule to address the Applicants' request for stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n12.\n\nBy communications of May 24, 26 and 27, 2017, the Parties transmitted to the Committee an agreed briefing schedule, which included one round of written submissions and oral arguments at the first session of the Committee.\n\n13.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, the Applicants filed their application for continued stay of enforcement of the Award along with exhibit A-47 and legal authorities ALA-23 through ALA-29 (the \"Stay Request\").\n\n14.\n\nOn May 31, 2017, the Committee took note of the Parties' agreement on the briefing schedule and decided to hold the first session on June 20, 2017, by telephone conference. In light of the agreed timetable, the Committee also invited the Parties to confirm that they agreed to extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award and the 30-day time limit set forth in Arbitration Rule 54(2) until the date of the first session.\n\n15.\n\nOn June 1 and 5, 2017, the Parties confirmed that they agreed to extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award and the time limit for the decision on the Stay Request until June 20, 2017.\n\n16.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Stay Request along with exhibits R-269 through R-282, legal authorities RLA-272 through RLA-276, and selected exhibits from the arbitration proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 13, 2017, the Respondent submitted an amended version of its observations on the Stay Request.\n\n18.\n\nAs required by Arbitration Rules 13 and 53, and by agreement of the Parties, the first session was held on June 20, 2017, by telephone conference, from 9am until 10:37am (Washington, D.C. time). Participating in the session were:\n\nMembers of the *ad hoc* Committee :\n\nJudge Dominique Hascher, President of the Committee  \nProf. Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, Member  \nMs. Jean Kalicki, Member\n\nICSID Secretariat :\n\nMs. Laura Bergamini, Secretary of the Committee\n\nRepresenting Churchill and Planet :\n\nMr. Audley Sheppard QC, Clifford Chance LLP  \nDr. Sam Luttrell, Clifford Chance LLP  \nDr. Romesh Weeramantry, Clifford Chance LLP  \nMs. Clementine Packer, Clifford Chance LLP  \nMr. David Quinlivan, Churchill Mining Plc  \nMr. Russell Hardwick, Churchill Mining Plc  \nMr. Nicholas Smith, Churchill Mining Plc\n\nRepresenting the Republic of Indonesia :\n\nMs. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMr. Mark H. O'Donoghue, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMr. Marat Umerov, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMr. Freddy Harris, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia   \nMr. Cahyo R. Muzhar, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia  \nMr. Ardiningrat Hidayat, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia  \nMs. Agvirta Armilia Sativa, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia  \nMs. Dinda Kartika, Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia\n\n19.\n\nDuring the session, the Committee and the Parties discussed a number of procedural matters, including the schedule for the written pleadings. The Parties confirmed their agreement on certain procedural matters and made oral submissions on certain points of disagreement. The Parties also presented oral pleadings on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, which were recorded.\n\n20.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, having deliberated by telephone call, the Committee ruled that the stay of enforcement was to continue until it issued a final determination on the matter.\n\n21.\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the Committee issued a Decision on the Stay Request (the \"Stay Decision\") by which it decided that the stay of enforcement would continue pending a decision on the Annulment Application provided that the Applicants use their best efforts to pledge a property located in the East Kalimantan Province (Indonesia) (the \"Port Land\").\n\n22.\n\nOn July 11, 2017, the Applicants provided an update on the actions taken to pledge the Port Land.\n\n23.\n\nOn July 14, 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the subsequent conduct of the annulment proceedings and setting forth the procedural calendar of the proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Committee informed the Parties that the hearing on annulment would take place in Singapore and proposed possible hearing dates.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 23, 2017, the Applicants provided a further update on the execution of the pledge and inquired after Respondent's availability for executing the pledge through a power of attorney to sell and transfer the Port Land (the \"POA\").\n\n26.\n\nOn July 24, 2017, the Respondent requested further information from the Applicants on the POA and indicated that, absent adequate responses, the POA could not be deemed to produce effects under Indonesian law.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 25, 2017, the Applicants responded to the Respondent's letter of July 24, 2017, attaching documents concerning the purchase of a parcel of the Port Land. On the same date, the Applicants indicated that they were transmitting the files containing the transaction documents for all parcels comprising the Port Land to the Respondent via an online sharing platform.\n\n28.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, the Respondent informed the Applicants *inter alia* that it could not access the documents shared via the online platform.\n\n29.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Applicants confirmed that the documents relating to the Port Land were uploaded to the online platform indicated by the Respondent.\n\n30.\n\nOn the same date, the Applicants filed a copy of a deed poll made under Australian law to execute the POA (the \"Deed Poll\") and a witness statement from Mr. David Quinlivan. The Applicants requested that the Committee either (i) confirm that the stay of enforcement of the Award remain in place (being the condition set forth in paragraph 42 of the Stay Decision met), or (ii) extend the stay until the Committee rule on the Applicants' compliance with paragraph 42 of the Stay Decision.\n\n31.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Committee invited the Respondent's comments on the Applicants' request and temporarily extended the stay of the enforcement.\n\n32.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Respondent responded to the Applicants' email of July 25, 2017 and submitted exhibit R-ANN-283.\n\n33.\n\nIn light of the Parties' unavailability on the hearing dates proposed by the Committee, on July 31, 2017, the Committee proposed additional hearing dates.\n\n34.\n\nOn August 2, 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Applicants' request of July 27, 2017 together with exhibits R-ANN-284 to R-ANN-289, R-80, R-86, R-226, and C-257.\n\n35.\n\nOn August 3, 2017, the Committee decided that, by signing the Deed Poll, the Applicants had met the condition in paragraph 42 of the Stay Decision, and thus the stay of enforcement of the Award would continue pending a decision on the Annulment Application.\n\n36.\n\nOn August 3 and 4, 2017, the Parties confirmed their availabilities on the additional hearing dates proposed by the Committee.\n\n37.\n\nOn August 10, 2017, the Committee confirmed that the hearing on annulment would take place on July 16 and 17, 2018.\n\n38.\n\nOn October 20, 2017, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the \"Counter-Memorial\") along with annex A, exhibits R-ANN-290 through R-ANN-311, legal authorities RLA-ANN-277 through RLA-ANN-309 and selected exhibits and legal authorities from the arbitration proceedings.\n\n39.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Parties agreed upon a few changes to the procedural calendar, subsequently approved by the Committee.\n\n40.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, the Applicants filed their reply on annulment (the \"Reply\") along with exhibit A-48, annex A to Procedural Order No. 16 from the arbitration proceedings, and legal authorities ALA-30 and ALA-31.\n\n41.\n\nOn April 10, 2018, the Respondent filed its rejoinder on annulment (the \"Rejoinder\") along with exhibits R-ANN-312 through R-ANN-329 and legal authorities RLA-ANN-307, RLA-ANN-310 through RLA-ANN-338.\n\n42.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, the Respondent filed a request to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award and a request for security for costs (the \"Termination Application and Security Request\") together with the expert report of Professor Ida Nurlinda, exhibits R-ANN-330 through R-ANN-353, legal authorities RLA-ANN-339 through RLA-ANN-376, and selected exhibits from the arbitration proceedings.\n\n43.\n\nOn April 23, 2018, the Applicants filed their observations on the Termination Application and Security Request together with exhibits A-49 through A-52 and legal authorities ALA-32 through ALA-35.\n\n44.\n\nOn May 7, 2018, the Respondent filed a reply on the Termination Application and Security Request together with exhibits R-ANN-354 and R-ANN-355, and legal authorities RLA-ANN-377 through RLA-ANN-385.\n\n45.\n\nOn May 24, 2018, the Parties advised the Committee on the agreements they were able to reach on the schedule of the hearing and its organization.\n\n46.\n\nOn June 11, 2018, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n47.\n\nOn June 19, 2018, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 providing directions on the organization of the hearing.\n\n48.\n\nThe hearing on annulment was held in Singapore on July 16 and 17, 2018 (the \"Hearing on Annulment\").

THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n**A. The procedure before the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Committee will briefly summarize in this section certain relevant aspects of the procedural background of the arbitration proceedings, which are elaborated in paragraphs 1 to 99 of the Award.\n\n57.\n\nOn February 24, 2014, the Tribunal issued two decisions (one in respect of the *Churchill v. Indonesia* case and the other in respect of the *Planet v. Indonesia* case) upholding its jurisdiction over the dispute. Following these decisions, the Parties were invited to agree on a schedule for the merits phase of the arbitration, which they could not do.\n\n58.\n\nOn April 22, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, declining the State's request for bifurcation between liability and *quantum* and establishing a calendar for the merits phase of the arbitration.\n\n59.\n\nOn May 16, 2014, the State filed a request for inspection of documents along with a list of disputed documents and a forensic handwriting examination report from Mr. Gideon Epstein.\n\n60.\n\nOn July 22, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, ordering the Parties to make certain documents available for inspection. The inspection was conducted in Singapore on August 29, 2014 under the supervision of ICSID.\n\n61.\n\nOn September 25, 2014, the Respondent filed an application for dismissal of the Claimants' claims based on allegations that the Ridlatama mining licenses were forged and fabricated (the \"Forgery Dismissal Application\"),1 appending several witness statements (including those of Messrs. Ishak and Noor)2 and expert reports from Econ One Research and Bara Consulting. The Respondent asked the Tribunal for a hearing within three weeks to address the authenticity of 34 disputed documents relating to licenses and permits for the EKCP and an award dismissing all of the Claimants' claims as inadmissible by reason of the invalidity and illegality of the disputed Ridlatama licenses.\n\nExhibit A-05.\n\nExhibit A-04 (Mr. Noor's witness statement). The Parties have not submitted Mr. Ishak's witness statement as an exhibit in the annulment proceedings. However, the day before the Hearing, the Respondent submitted (also on behalf of the Applicants) USB drives containing the entire record of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n62.\n\nOn September 26, 2014, the Claimants provided their preliminary comments on the Forgery Dismissal Application and opposed the request for an immediate hearing.3\n\nExhibit A-06.\n\n63.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, following further exchanges on the Forgery Dismissal Application, the Parties and the Tribunal held a hearing by telephone conference.4\n\nExhibit A-07.\n\n64.\n\nOn October 27, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (\"PO12\") rejecting the State's request for immediate adjudication of the forgery issue.5 The Tribunal also decided to bifurcate the proceedings between a liability and a *quantum* phase.\n\nExhibit A-08.\n\n65.\n\nOn November 3, 2014, the Respondent submitted a request for reconsideration of PO126 and a table titled \"Non-Viability of Claimants' Claims Based on Finding of Forgery of Ridlatama Licenses\"7 detailing the reasons why, in its view, a finding on forgery would render inadmissible each of the Claimants' claims.\n\nExhibit A-09(1).\n\nExhibit A-09(2).\n\n66.\n\nOn November 10, 2014, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's request for reconsideration of PO12.8\n\nExhibit A-10.\n\n67.\n\nOn November 18, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (\"PO13\") granting the Respondent's request for reconsideration and deciding to address the authenticity of the disputed documents as a matter of priority. The Tribunal determined that the scope of the authenticity phase would extend to \"all factual aspects relating to forgery as well as the legal consequences of a finding of forgery,\" and specified that the Parties were not prevented from addressing other appropriate matters in connection with the forgery allegations and arguments.9\n\nExhibit A-11.\n\n68.\n\nOn November 23, 2014, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal reconsider PO13 and reinstate PO12.10\n\nExhibit A-12.\n\n69.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, the Respondent opposed the Claimants' request for reconsideration of PO13.11 The Claimants and the Respondent filed further submissions on the Claimants' request on December 8 and 12, 2014, respectively.12\n\nExhibit A-13.\n\nExhibits A-14, A-15(1) and A-15(2).\n\n70.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (\"PO15\") denying the Claimants' request for reconsideration and reaffirming PO13.13 At paragraph 34 of PO15, the Tribunal described the scope of the document authenticity phase as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of the Claimants' argument that their allegedly surviving claims are intertwined with the forgery allegations. At this stage of the proceedings, it appears correct that for instance the facts in support of estoppel overlap with the facts of the expropriation and fair and equitable treatment claims. However, these overlapping facts are not meant to be part of the bifurcated issues. Indeed, paragraph 28 of PO13 defines the scope of the authenticity phase as comprising (i) the factual aspects of forgery and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery. Accordingly, the document authenticity phase was defined as being limited to (i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or not (including especially who signed the documents and how) and (ii) legal submissions on the positions in law in a scenario where there would be forgery (including for instance the legal requirements for estoppel, as opposed to the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel).\n\nThe Tribunal also set forth a revised calendar for the document authenticity phase.\n\nExhibit A-16.\n\n71.\n\nOn February 3, 2015, Clifford Chance informed the Tribunal that they had been appointed to represent the Claimants in the arbitration.\n\n72.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement to conduct a second document inspection the week of April 13, 2015.\n\n73.\n\nOn March 13, 2015, the Parties exchanged their requests for production and inspection of documents.\n\n74.\n\nFollowing further exchanges between the Parties, on April 6, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 (\"PO16\"), addressing the Parties' requests for production of documents and inspection.14 In particular, the Tribunal granted the Claimants' requests Nos. 11 and 16 (requesting the production of investigative material, the \"Police Files\") and dismissed the Respondent's objection based on the confidentiality of such documents.15\n\nExhibits A-19(1) and A-19(2).\n\nExhibit A-19(2), para. 6.\n\n75.\n\nOn April 16 and 17, 2015, a second document inspection took place in Singapore under the supervision of ICSID.\n\n76.\n\nOn April 20, 2015, the State requested, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal reconsider its decisions in PO16 requiring the production of the Police Files or, in the alternative, that the Tribunal not draw any adverse inferences from the Respondent's failure to produce these documents.16\n\nExhibit A-20.\n\n77.\n\nOn April 24, 2015, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's request for reconsideration and argued that the State was hampering their ability to rebut the State's serious allegations of fraud and limiting the Tribunal's ability to make an informed and fair decision.17\n\nExhibit A-21.\n\n78.\n\nOn April 29, 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal pointing out that the time limit to produce documents had lapsed without the requested documents being produced and soliciting the Tribunal's decision on the Respondent's request for reconsideration of PO16 with respect to the Police Files.18\n\nExhibit A-22.\n\n79.\n\nOn April 30, 2015, the Respondent replied to the Claimants' latest submissions and reiterated its request for reconsideration of PO16, also stating that the Police Files could not be produced while the police investigation was ongoing.19 The Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter on May 5, 2015.20\n\nExhibit A-23.\n\nExhibit A-24 (this letter is incorrectly dated April 5, 2015).\n\n80.\n\nOn May 12, 2015, the Tribunal decided on a few pending issues, including the Respondent's request for reconsideration of PO16. The Tribunal took note of the nonproduction of the Police Files and the Parties' positions as to the justification (or lack of justification) for the non-production and adverse inferences. The Tribunal noted that it would \"take these matters into consideration if and when relevant to the assessment of the evidence before it, being specified that the Parties may further address these matters in their post-hearing briefs if they so wish.\"21\n\nExhibit A-25.\n\n81.\n\nOn May 29, 2015, the Claimants filed their reply to the Forgery Dismissal Application along with supporting documentation.22\n\nExhibits A-26, A-26(1), A-26(2), A-26(3) and A-26(4).\n\n82.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, the President of the Tribunal and the Parties held a pre-hearing telephone conference to discuss the organization of the hearing on document authenticity.\n\n83.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, following the Respondent's indication that Mr. Noor would not be available to testify at the hearing, the Claimants requested that (i) the Tribunal disregard Mr. Noor's witness statement; (ii) Mr. Noor's witness statement be struck from the record; and (iii) the State's submissions relying upon Mr. Noor's witness statement be disregarded.\n\n84.\n\nOn August 1, 2015, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it had questions for Mr. Noor and invited counsel for the Respondent to inform Mr. Noor that the Tribunal would appreciate the opportunity of hearing him at the hearing.\n\n85.\n\nOn August 2, 2015, a third document inspection took place in Singapore under the supervision of ICSID.\n\n86.\n\nThe hearing on document authenticity took place from August 3 to 10, 2015 in Singapore (the \"2015 Hearing\").23 Mr. Noor did not appear and the Tribunal, after hearing the Parties, decided to disregard his witness statement.24 On the last day of the 2015 Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the way forward and the questions to be addressed in the post-hearing briefs.\n\nThe 2015 Hearing transcripts have been submitted into the record as Exhibits A-28 through A-34.\n\nExhibit A-29, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [8:19] to [8:24].\n\n87.\n\nOn August 20, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 (\"PO20\") dealing with post-hearing matters.25 The Tribunal invited the Parties to address a few questions in their post-hearing briefs26 and stated that:\n\nHaving considered the positions set forth by the Parties at the end of the hearing, the Tribunal confirms that the Parties are to address matters falling within the scope of Procedural Order No. 15 especially paragraph 34. In other words, the Parties shall address (i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or not and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery. Matter (i) includes the question whether, if they were not handwritten, the impugned signatures were affixed with authority. Matter (ii) about the legal position in the event of forgery does not cover the effect of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses on the exploitation licenses. The present directions come in lieu of any different comments made by the Tribunal at the hearing.27\n\nExhibit A-35.\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 6.\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 5.\n\n88.\n\nOn October 20, 2015, the Parties filed their post-hearing briefs.28 The Parties filed their replies to the post-hearing briefs on November 17, 201529 and then exchanged their submissions on costs.\n\nExhibits A-36(1) and A-36(2) and Exhibit A-37.\n\nExhibits A-38, A-39(1) and A-39(2).\n\n89.\n\nOn September 9, 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their views on paragraph 163 of the *Minnotte v. Poland* award (\"*Minnotte*\") in connection with three specific issues (\"*Minnotte* Direction\"). *Minnotte* was a decision dealing with the consequences of third party fraud on which none of the Parties had previously relied. The Tribunal authorised the Parties to submit their comments (limited to 15 pages) with supporting legal authorities, and reply submissions (limited to 8 pages) without legal authorities. It further specified that \"[i]f the parties consider it useful to refer to facts in addressing the issues set out above, they shall do so on the basis of the evidence in the record,\" and that \"[o]nce it has deliberated on these additional submissions, the Tribunal expects to be in a position to issue its decision(s)/award(s).\"30\n\nExhibit A-41.\n\n90.\n\nOn September 23, 2016, the Claimants filed their comments on *Minnotte* with the Secretariat. On the same day, the Respondent requested a one-week extension to file its comments.\n\n91.\n\nOn September 24, 2016, the Tribunal extended the time limit for the Parties' comments on *Minnotte* until September 27, 2016 and for the reply submissions until October 11, 2016.\n\n92.\n\nThe Parties timely filed their comments on *Minnotte*31 and their reply submissions32 and consented to the issuance of one decision/award for the two joined arbitration cases.\n\nExhibits A-42 and A-43.\n\nExhibits A-44 and A-45.\n\n93.\n\nThe proceedings were closed on December 6, 2016.\n\nB. **The Respondent's position before the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent's position before the Tribunal is set out in detail in paragraphs 100, 101, and from 106 to 176 of the Award.\n\n95.\n\nIn short, the State claimed that the mining licenses and related approvals held by the Ridlatama Companies (which constituted the basis for the Claimants' investments in EKCP) were forged and fabricated as part of \"a massive, systemic and sophisticated scheme to defraud the Republic of Indonesia.\" Specifically, the Respondent disputed the authenticity of 34 documents listed in paragraph 108 of the Award and argued that the upgrading of the non-authentic survey and exploration licenses to exploitation mining licenses in March 2009 was secured through deception and fraud.\n\n96.\n\nThe State argued that a finding of forgery and fraud would dispose of the Claimants' entire case because the Claimants' investments depend entirely on the rights conveyed by the licenses allegedly held by the Ridlatama Companies.\n\n97.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal issue an award:\n\n(i) Deciding that the Ridlatama Companies' mining licenses for general survey and exploration upgrades were forged;\n\n(ii) Deciding that the other impugned documents were forged;\n\n(iii) Dismissing all claims asserted by the Claimants; and\n\n(iv) Ordering the Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with the arbitration.33\n\nAward, para. 100.\n\n98.\n\nIn its reply post-hearing brief, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Find that the Ridlatama Companies' mining undertaking licenses for general survey and exploration were not authentic;\n\n(b) Find that the other impugned documents were not authentic;\n\n(c) Issue an award dismissing all of the claims asserted by the Claimants;\n\n(d) Order the Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with the arbitration; and\n\n(e) Order such other relief as it deemed appropriate.34\n\nAward, para. 101.\n\n**C. The Claimants' position before the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nChurchill and Planet's position before the Tribunal is described in paragraphs 102, 103, and from 177 to 227 of the Award.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants maintained that the State failed to provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the disputed documents were forged and fabricated by Ridlatama, or of the existence of a massive, systematic and sophisticated scheme to defraud the Respondent. They further claimed that the signatures on the 34 documents were authorised and hence the documents were validly issued.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that the legal consequences of a finding of forgery or fraud would be very limited as the majority of the Claimants' investments would in any event remain legally valid. They further argued that the State failed to provide cogent reasons why a finding of forgery would lead to the dismissal of the Claimants' case and admitted, at the 2015 Hearing, that a factual finding of forgery would not determine the legal question of the validity of the disputed licenses nor of the Exploitation Licenses under Indonesian law (on which no arguments or expert evidence was presented to the Tribunal). Churchill and Planet also argued that Mr. Noor's refusal to attend the 2015 Hearing and the exclusion of his witness statement disposed of the Respondent's case on the Exploitation Licenses, which the Parties did not dispute he had signed by hand.\n\n102.\n\nIn any event, according to the Claimants, a finding of forgery would not affect their case considering the following legal arguments: estoppel, acquiescence, legitimate expectations, unjust enrichment, and internationally composite wrongful act.\n\n103.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal dismiss the Forgery Dismissal Application and order that the Respondent pay the Claimants' legal costs in full.35\n\nExhibit A-26(1), para. 260.\n\n**D. The Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal began its analysis by addressing a few preliminary issues, including the scope of the Award, the applicable law to the merits, and the burden and standard of proof.36 As to the burden and standard of proof, the Tribunal found that:\n\nIt is a well-established rule in international law that each Party bears the burden of proving the facts which it alleges (*actori incumbit onus probandi*). Since the Respondent alleges that the Survey and Exploration Licenses and related documents are forged and that the Exploitation Licenses were obtained through deception, the Respondent bears the burden of proving its allegations of forgery and deception.\n\n[...] the Respondent carries the burden of proving forgery and fraud, which proof will be measured on a standard of balance of probabilities or *intime conviction* taking into account that more persuasive evidence is required for implausible facts, it being specified that intent or motive need not be shown for a finding of forgery or fraud but may form part of the relevant circumstantial evidence. The Tribunal will assess all the available evidence on record and weigh it in the context of all relevant circumstances.37\n\nAward, paras. 228-253.\n\nAward, paras. 238 and 244.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to examine the factual aspects of the documents' authenticity, concluding that the general survey licenses, the exploration licenses and the ancillary documents were neither authentic nor authorized.38\n\nAward, paras. 254-444.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal then turned to the question of the authorship of the disputed documents39 and found that: (i) there was insufficient evidence to uphold the Claimants' theory that State officials had deliberately used signature methods that would allow them later to deny authorization, in the event the State eventually wished to award valuable licenses to another party (the \"Bad Faith Authorization Theory\"); (ii) a number of facts demonstrated that \"someone within the Regency assisted in the process of introducing the fabricated documents into the Regency's database and archives, thereby assisting in creating an appearance of legitimacy to the fraudulent scheme;\"40 and (iii) there was insufficient evidence to establish that corruption was involved in the issuance of the disputed documents.41\n\nAward, paras. 445-477.\n\nAward, paras. 458-462.\n\nAward, paras. 463-466.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal further examined the role of Ridlatama and the Claimants in the forgery and the fraud and found that: (i) evidence on the record pointed to Ridlatama's involvement;42 and (ii) while a few elements suggested the Claimants' involvement in the fraud, they were insufficient to reach a definite finding that the Claimants were the authors or instigators of the forgery and the fraud.43 The Award summarizes the Tribunal's findings as follows:\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal is of the view that the forgeries and the fraud were orchestrated by author(s) outside of the Regency, most likely Ridlatama, who benefited from the assistance from an insider to introduce the fabricated documents into the Regency's databases and archives. While the record points towards Ridlatama rather than the Claimants in relation to the forgery of the contentious documents, the Tribunal does not need to make a definitive finding to draw the proper legal consequences as the analysis below will show. It suffices for present purposes that, on the basis of the record, there is no conceivable author other than Ridlatama.44\n\nAward, paras. 467-472.\n\nAward, paras. 473-475.\n\nAward, para. 476.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal finally addressed the legal consequences of its findings of fraud and forgery.45\n\nAfter recalling the positions of the Parties46 and setting out the applicable legal framework,47 the Tribunal examined whether the Claimants' claims qualified for protection or should be dismissed.\n\nAward, paras. 478-532.\n\nAward, paras. 478-486.\n\nAward, paras. 488-506.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal found that claims arising from rights based on fraud or forgery that a claimant deliberately or unreasonably ignored are inadmissible as a matter of international public policy, as contended by the Respondent,48 and must be dismissed \"on the ground of a threshold bar, without entering into an analysis of the alleged treaty violations.\"49\n\nAward, para. 508.\n\nAward, para. 507.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal then elaborated on the seriousness of the fraud tainting the entire EKCP.50 In particular, in paragraphs 512 and 515 of the Award, the Tribunal noted as follows:\n\nThe facts suggest that the motive driving the fraud was to extend Ridlatama's mining rights in the EKCP beyond the unpromising tenements of PT RP and PT RS, and especially to access the PT RTM block which contains 95% of the coal reserves discovered in the EKCP. To this end, forged licenses and related documents were fabricated to give an impression of lawful entitlement. That false impression was then used to obtain hand-signed Exploitation Licenses issued on the misguided assumption that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights. The fraud was then later perpetuated with the forgery of the Re-Enactment Decrees after the Exploitation Licenses had been revoked. [...]\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the acts of forgery brought to light in these proceedings are of a particularly serious nature in light of the number and nature of forged documents and of the aim pursued, namely to orchestrate, legitimize and perpetuate a fraudulent scheme to gain access to valuable mining rights.51\n\nAward, paras. 509-515.\n\nAward, paras. 512 and 515 (footnotes omitted).\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal also explained the reasons why it was not persuaded by the Claimants' contention that they had conducted an \"extensive\" and \"exhaustive\" due diligence when verifying the authenticity of the disputed mining licenses.52\n\nAward, paras. 516-527.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal's findings on the legal consequences of the forgery and fraud are summarized in a few paragraphs53 that are worth quoting in full as they have been debated between the Parties in these annulment proceedings:\n\n528. In conclusion, the Tribunal cannot but hold that all the claims before it are inadmissible. This conclusion derives from the facts analyzed above, which demonstrate that the claims are based on documents forged to implement a fraud aimed at obtaining mining rights. The author of the forgeries and fraud is not positively identified (although indications in the record all point to Ridlatama possibly with the assistance of a Regency insider). Notwithstanding, the seriousness, sophistication and scope of the scheme are such that the fraud taints the entirety of the Claimants' investment in the EKCP. As a result, the general principle of good faith and the prohibition of abuse of process entail that the claims before this Tribunal cannot benefit from investment protection under the [BITs] and are, consequently, deemed inadmissible.\n\n529. The inadmissibility applies to all the claims raised in this arbitration, because the entire EKCP project is an illegal enterprise affected by multiple forgeries and all claims relate to the EKCP. This is further supported by the Claimants' lack of diligence in carrying out their investment.\n\n530. The conclusion reached by the Tribunal is within the scope of the present phase of the arbitration as it was circumscribed in Procedural Orders Nos. 13, 15 and 20. In this context, the Tribunal notes in particular that it arrived at this outcome without there being a need to address the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian law (see above paragraphs 232-233). Indeed, whatever their validity under municipal law, the Exploitation Licenses were embedded in a fraudulent scheme, being surrounded by forgeries. Forged documents preceded and followed them in time with the Re-Enactment Decrees, which under a non-authentic signature purported to revoke the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses. The accumulation of forgeries both before and after the Exploitation Licenses show that, irrespective of their lawfulness under local law, the entire EKCP was fraudulent, thereby triggering the inadmissibility of the claims under international law.\n\n531. The Tribunal further observes that, in light of the declaration of inadmissibility of all the claims, it can dispense with ruling on the Claimants' alleged substitute causes of action. Such causes of action exclusively relate to the Claimants' investments in the EKCP. Since the latter are tainted by the fraud, so are the substitute claims by force of consequence.\n\n532. Since all the claims are held inadmissible, the Tribunal considers that these proceedings have reached their conclusion and therefore turns to the allocation of costs.54 [Footnotes omitted.]\n\nAward, paras. 528-532.\n\nAward, paras. 528-531.\n\n113.\n\nAfter addressing the costs,55 the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n(1) The Decisions on Jurisdiction of [February 24, 2014] are incorporated by reference into this Award;\n\n(2) The 34 disputed documents listed in paragraph 108 of this Award are not authentic and unauthorized;\n\n(3) The claims brought in this arbitration are inadmissible;\n\n(4) The Claimants shall bear the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal as well as ICSID's administrative fees and thus pay to the Respondent USD 800,000 or any lower amount that may arise out of ICSID's final statement of account;\n\n(5) The Claimants shall bear 75% of the expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with these proceedings and thus pay to the Respondent USD 8,646,528;\n\n(6) All other claims and requests are dismissed.56\n\nAward, paras. 533-556.\n\nAward, para. 557.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A.The Applicants' submissions**\n---------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 7 above, the Applicants argue that the Award should be annulled on three grounds: (i) Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, (ii) Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and (iii) Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**i. Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Applicants argue that right to be heard, treatment of evidence, equal treatment of the parties and burden of proof are fundamental rules of procedure whose breach may lead to an annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.57 According to the Applicants, based on this provision, *ad hoc* committees have found that tribunals cannot \"surprise\" the parties with issues that neither of them has invoked, argued or reasonably anticipated,58 nor conduct factual investigations on issues that may prove determinative of the outcome of the case without re-opening the proceedings.59 The Applicants further argue that ICSID case law requires tribunals to grant the parties a full opportunity to be heard if they wish to apply a legal framework different from that argued by the parties.60\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 82-86.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 84.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 84; see also Tr.

Day 2 [Luttrell] [37:19] to [37:25] and [41:2] to [43:20].\n\n116.\n\nThe Applicants claim that a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure is \"serious\" if the violation is substantial and such as to deprive the complainant of the protection that the rule was intended to provide.61\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 85 and 86.\n\n**a. The** ***Minnotte*** **Direction**\n---------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Applicants claim that, by not allowing evidence relevant to the legal framework introduced by the *Minnotte* Direction, the Tribunal deprived them of a full opportunity to present their case on a novel legal framework that the Award found decisive.62\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 87-104; Reply, paras. 28-68; Tr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [47:1] to [53:17] and Tr. Day 2 [Luttrell] [43:21] to [45:25].\n\n118.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, PO15 and PO20 limited the scope of the factual inquiry in the document authenticity phase to the issue of whether the impugned documents were authentic.63 In the Applicants' view, by signalling that it did not want to hear about the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel, the Tribunal excluded from the scope of the document authenticity phase the factual aspects of any legal theory in which evidence of good faith was required (including the theory underlying *Minnotte*).64 However, the Applicants note, more than one year after the 2015 Hearing, the Tribunal introduced *ex officio Minnotte*, which raised issues very different than those addressed in the document authenticity phase (including lack of due care or negligence of the investor to investigate the factual circumstances surrounding the making of the investment, and the deliberate closing of the eyes to an indication of serious misconduct or crime).65 According to the Applicants, with the *Minnotte* Direction, the Tribunal surprised the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could not anticipate.66 At that time, the Applicants had not led (and could not have led) evidence in relation to the factors relevant to the *Minnotte* test because neither of the Parties had relied upon this decision or anticipated the case.67 However, in the *Minnotte* Direction, the Tribunal limited the Parties' submissions to the existing evidence in the record, thereby precluding them from filing evidence necessary to address the *Minnotte* factors and denying them the opportunity to present their case,68 as the Applicants promptly protested.69 Furthermore, the Tribunal eventually decided to dismiss the case based on the novel legal framework.70\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 88; Tr.

Day 1 [Sheppard] [50:15] to [50:20].\n\n120.\n\nThe Applicants further argue that the breach of due process was serious because the *Minnotte* factors were dispositive (as the overall structure of the Award shows) and the new evidence that they could have proffered (including the testimony of Mr. Mazak) could have impacted the Award.77\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 94 and 95; Reply, paras. 46-57, and 58-68; Tr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [51:16] to [52:25].\n\n121.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Applicants also argued that the Tribunal breached due process by making a decision on admissibility without previously informing the Parties that international public policy and principles of good faith were issues to be addressed in the document authenticity phase.78 According to the Applicants, it was improper for the Tribunal to introduce an argument that wholly favoured one side (the State) and make a finding on admissibility without hearing arguments and evidence on all of the arguments in the round (including the Applicants' counter-arguments).79 The Applicants also argued that the Tribunal did not treat the Parties equally as it applied \"good faith [...] asymmetrically, only to the Claimants.\"80 According to the Applicants, having explored the good faith of Churchill under *Minnotte*, it was incumbent on the Tribunal to also weigh the good faith and the role of the State when making its finding on admissibility.81\n\nTr.

The re-admission of Mr. Noor's evidence**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Tribunal denied their right to be heard on whether Mr. Noor's, the former Regent of East Kutai, evidence should be effectively (even if not formally) re-admitted and given weight.82\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 105-112; Reply, paras. 90-102.\n\n123.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the State's main use of Mr. Noor's testimony was to prove that the Exploitation Licenses were void even if they were not forged.83 In spite of its decision to disregard Mr. Noor's witness statement (paragraph 84 of the Award), the Tribunal referred to Mr. Noor's testimony in paragraph 165 of the Award and gave weight to it at paragraph 512 when concluding that the hand-signed Exploitation Licenses were issued on the \"misguided assumption\" that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights.84 In the Applicants' view, the only evidence the Tribunal could possibly have relied upon in making this finding was Mr. Noor's witness statement.85\n\nReply, paras. 91 and 92.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 105-112.\n\nReply, paras. 97-99.\n\n124.\n\nThe Applicants further argue that, by effectively readmitting Mr. Noor's evidence without prior notice, the Tribunal left them \"with no ability to rebut the presumption which had been formed in the [T]ribunal's mind that the [E]xploitation [L]icenses had been signed on a misguided assumption\" since they could no longer cross-examine Mr. Noor.86 They further argue that this decision, compared with the way the Tribunal treated the Police Files, shows that the Tribunal treated the Parties unequally.87\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [66:1] to [66:10].\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [66:18] to [67:23].\n\n125.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the breach of their procedural rights had a material impact upon the outcome of the Award as it led to the effective re-admission of Mr. Noor's evidence, which then was critical for the Tribunal's finding on fraud under the *Minnotte* test.88\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 112.\n\n**c. The reversal of the burden of proof in relation to fraud and deception and to the** ***Minnotte*** **factors**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nChurchill and Planet claim that, notwithstanding the finding in paragraph 238 of the Award, the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof in breach of the principle *actori incumbit probatio* and put the burden of proof on the Claimants, including with respect to fraud and deception.89\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 123-127; Reply, paras. 103-106.\n\n127.\n\nThe Applicants point to paragraph 522 of the Award to argue that the Tribunal placed on the Claimants the burden to *disprove* forgery.90 They further refer to paragraph 512 of the Award and argue that the finding therein can only be explained by a reversal of the burden to prove deception.91 According to the Applicants, this paragraph suggests that the Tribunal (i) placed on them the burden of proving that Mr. Noor did not hand-sign the Exploitation Licenses due to the \"false impression\" of their lawful entitlement, and (ii) found that they had not met their burden. In the Applicants' view, however, it was for the party asserting deception (the State) to prove that the \"false impression\" created by the forged documents was \"used\" to influence Mr. Noor to sign the Exploitation Licenses.92 Since the evidence relied upon by the State (Mr. Noor's testimony) to this purpose was struck from the record, the Tribunal had no reason to require the Claimants to disprove deception.93\n\nPara. 522 of the Award reads in its relevant part as follows: \"the Claimants did not seek to ascertain the means of signing mining licenses in Indonesia [\u2026] although that information would have been readily available.\" The Applicants further note that the Tribunal's condemnation in paragraph 522 cannot square with the admission of the former Regent, Mr. Ishak, who acknowledged that \"anything can happen\" inside the Regency (Annulment Application, para. 126, fn. 185).\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\n128.\n\nThe Applicants further state that this unlawful allocation of the burden of proof had a major impact on the outcome of the case because the Applicants could not discharge the burden placed upon them without cross-examining Mr. Noor.94 The Applicants argue that the overall procedural treatment of Mr. Noor's evidence (including the Tribunal's refusal to draw adverse inferences from his non-appearance) may call into question the impartiality of the Tribunal.95\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 125 and 127; Reply, paras. 105 and 106.\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\n129.\n\nFinally, the Applicants allege that the Tribunal reversed the burden to prove the *Minnotte* factors.96 According to the Applicants, it was for the State (who had asserted fraud and forgery) to submit evidence on what a \"reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector\" would have done in the circumstances of the case because they could not possibly bear the burden of proving the benchmark against which their own conduct was to be tested.97 As the State brought no evidence on the due diligence standards, the burden of proof on this point could never have shifted on the Claimants.98\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 128-133.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 129.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 132.\n\n**d. The Infection Issue**\n--------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Tribunal denied their right to be heard on whether the Exploitation Licenses were stand-alone legal title instruments that, under Indonesian law, remained valid even if the underlying documents were forged (the \"Infection Issue\").99 According to the Applicants, this breach is a consequence of the primary violation of due process consisting in denying them the right to be heard on the *Minnotte* factors.100\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 113-122; Reply, paras. 100, and 110-115; Tr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [67:24] to [69:7].\n\nReply, para. 112.\n\n131.\n\nHaving found that the *Minnotte* bar rendered all of the Claimants' claims inadmissible, the Tribunal concluded that it did not need to hear the Parties on the Infection Issue and dismissed the case without admitting submissions on the validity of the Exploitation Licences under Indonesian law. According to the Applicants, the Tribunal did so although (i) the Infection Issue had been carved out from the document authenticity phase (in PO15 and PO20) on the common understanding that it would be addressed in a later phase of the proceedings;101 (ii) the Claimants had pointed out that they considered the Infection Issue as a \"major\" issue;102 and (iii) the importance of the Infection Issue had been \"elevated\" following the Tribunal's decision to exclude Mr. Noor's evidence at the 2015 Hearing.103\n\nThe Applicants argue that, by its decision, the Tribunal deprived the Claimants of the ability to make submissions (and provide expert evidence) on how their investments - the Exploitation Licenses - would have a legal existence notwithstanding a finding of forgery.104\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 63-69, 115, and 118-121.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 115.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 115, 116, and 63 (noting that without Mr. Noor's witnessing that he was deceived into signing the Exploitation Licenses, the State needed \"the law to do the work that the facts could not do\" and show that, by operation of Indonesian law, the Exploitation Licenses were \"infected\" by the forgery of the general survey and exploration licenses).\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 117.\n\n132.\n\nResponding to the argument that nothing in PO13, PO15 or PO20 prevented them from elaborating on the Infection Issue, the Applicants note that, throughout the document authenticity phase, \"they simply did not have a case to answer\" on that issue, and the significance of the Infection Issue was elevated by the exclusion of Mr. Noor's evidence.105\n\nReply, para. 115.\n\n**e. Denial of justice**\n------------------------\n\n133.\n\nIn their Reply, the Applicants claim that they were not given the opportunity to brief the question of whether they suffered a denial of justice before the Indonesian courts.106 Specifically, according to the Applicants, the Tribunal denied them due process by dismissing their denial of justice claim (without reasons and against a previous finding in PO12) while the evidentiary record on it was \"virtually non-existent,\" due to the fact that in PO15 the Tribunal had directed them not to submit at that stage evidence supporting their claim or on why their claim could survive a finding of forgery.107\n\nReply, para. 124.\n\nReply, para. 124.\n\n**f. State responsibility**\n---------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Applicants allege that they were never given an opportunity to present a full case to support their arguments on State responsibility.108 In particular, the Applicants argue that, if allowed to do so, they could have provided \"further evidence to demonstrate the full scale of the State's involvement in the fraudulent scheme that the Tribunal found,\" and developed arguments on how the \"State-orchestrated fraud gives rise to substantive liability\" under international law.109 According to the Applicants, having found that someone inside the Regency was likely complicit in the fraud, the Tribunal was required to address the legal consequences of that finding on the State and on its objection to the admissibility of the Claimants' claims.110 In particular, the Applicants argue that, if the Tribunal was to apply international law to the conduct of Churchill (as it purported to do in applying *Minnotte*), it also should have applied the international law principles of State responsibility enshrined in Article 7 of the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\"). According to the Applicants, the Tribunal's one-sided application of general principles of international law amounts to a breach of the Applicants' right to be heard and an unequal treatment of the Parties.111\n\nReply, paras. 87-89; Tr.

Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: Manifest excess of powers**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, a failure to apply the proper law to the case may give ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention if it is \"manifest\" (meaning \"obvious, clear, easily recognizable\" or \"clearly capable of making a difference to the result\").113 At the Hearing on Annulment, the Applicants clarified that ICSID committees have read the term \"manifest\" as meaning \"easily perceived, obvious or flagrant, and without requiring an outcome analysis,\"114 and found that serious and obvious errors of law may be relevant in the context of Article 52(1)(b).115\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 134 and 135; see also Tr.

The Applicants then point to paragraph 530 of the Award, which expressly indicates that the Tribunal did not apply Indonesian law to the Infection Issue, and argue that, by failing to apply the proper law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.119 The Applicants also argue that the Tribunal would have exceeded its powers even if their claims were inadmissible due to the *Minnotte* bar because, under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal should have, in any event, applied Indonesian law to determine whether there was a lacuna or a conflict between local and international law.120\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 136-146; Reply, paras. 116-119.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 146; Reply, paras. 117 and 118.\n\n139.\n\nOn issue (ii) above, the Applicants recall that, in the arbitration, they pointed out that, if the fraud alleged by the State existed, the State's own officials would be implicated, and consequently \"the State would be responsible for the criminal wrongdoing of its public officials\" pursuant to Article 7 of the ILC Articles.121 The Applicants further note that, when the Tribunal introduced the *Minnotte* framework, they not only continued to argue State responsibility but also submitted that, if State officials had facilitated the fraud and forgery, the State could not rely on its own unlawful conduct to mount an admissibility objection to the investors' claims.122\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 148-155; Reply, paras. 69-74.\n\nReply, paras. 75 and 76.\n\n140.\n\nThe Applicants further note that in the Award (paragraph 476), the Tribunal found that \"an insider\" had assisted Ridlatama in the fraud. However, despite finding that the State's officials had probably done wrong, the Award makes no mention of Article 7 of the ILC Articles and the Claimants' argument that an admissibility objection predicated on lack of good faith cannot be made by a party that breached good faith itself.123 The Applicants argue that, faced with the State's admissions of criminal wrongdoing by its own senior officials and the Applicants' submissions on its legal consequences, the Tribunal's complete failure to engage on and apply the international law of State responsibility is inexplicable and constitutes a manifest excess of power.124 The Applicants further note that their arguments on State responsibility were potentially determinative in the legal framework applied by the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants' case:125 if the Tribunal had applied the law of State responsibility there would not have been a *Minnotte* bar at all.126\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 156 and 157; Reply, paras. 76 and 77.\n\nReply, para. 77.\n\nReply para. 79.\n\nReply, para. 82.\n\n141.\n\nOn point (iii) above, the Applicants reiterate that they took on significant risk in funding general survey, exploration and exploitation activities in EKCP, investing approximately USD 70 million.127 They further note that, thanks to their investments, the State learned of the location of major natural resources and sources of revenue through the transfers of intellectual property which had been generated for the EKCP.128 The Applicants also recall that, in the arbitration, they argued that \"illegality may operate as a defence to unjust enrichment [\u2026] only where the illegal act was done by the party that brings the unjust enrichment claim.\"129 However, despite no finding of fraud or forgery attributable to the Applicants themselves, the Tribunal did not address the Claimants' unjust enrichment claim130 and failed to apply the international law of unjust enrichment.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 160.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 161 and 162\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 165.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 159-167; Reply, para. 122.\n\n142.\n\nAt the Hearing on Annulment, the Applicants also argued that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by making a finding of inadmissibility outside the scope of its previous directions in PO15 and PO20131 and by introducing a new legal framework (*Minnotte*), whose factual foundation had not been part of the 2015 Hearing.132\n\nTr.

Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: Failure to state reasons**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, a failure to state reasons occurs when a tribunal does not address all of the parties' arguments that were accepted as relevant for the decision or were rejected but would have changed the decision, had they been accepted. The Applicants also argue that a breach of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention occurs if a tribunal fails to address (or ignores) highly relevant evidence which had the potential to be relevant to the outcome of the case, or if it provides reasons which are contradictory or frivolous.133\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 168-170.\n\n144.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Award is inconsistent as to whether Mr. Noor's evidence was disregarded. The Applicants point to paragraph 84 of the Award, which states that Mr. Noor's witness statement was disregarded, and argue that this statement is contradicted by paragraphs 165 and 512 of the Award, whose wording (and similarity with the text of Mr. Noor's witness statement) shows that the Tribunal in reality considered Mr. Noor's evidence.134\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 171-178; Reply, paras. 107-109.\n\n145.\n\nThe Applicants further claim that the Award failed to state the reasons for which:\n\na. The Tribunal readmitted (or did not disregard) Mr. Noor's evidence (paragraphs 165 and 512);135\n\nb. The Tribunal concluded that the Infection Issue was moot (paragraph 530); in particular, the Applicants argue that the Tribunal should have explained the reasons why the Exploitation Licenses were invalid under Indonesian law and/or why international law should override national law;136\n\nc. The Tribunal found that the Applicants' due diligence was defective (paragraph 504); in particular, according to the Applicants, the Tribunal failed to state the benchmark against which it assessed their due diligence (which makes the Award arbitrary on this point);137\n\nd. The Tribunal reversed its order for the production of the Police Files (accepting the Respondent's argument on privilege) without drawing adverse inferences against the State (paragraph 249);138\n\ne. Their arguments on State responsibility were dismissed (paragraphs 529 and 530);139\n\nf. Their unjust enrichment claim was dismissed (paragraphs 529 and 530) without applying the three-step analytical enquiry of the *Minnotte* test set forth in paragraph 503;140\n\ng. Their intellectual property claim was dismissed (paragraphs 529 and 530) notwithstanding the argument that this claim would survive a finding of forgery;141 and\n\nh. Their denial of justice claim was dismissed (paragraphs 529 and 530).142\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 179; Reply, paras. 107-109; Tr.

Day 1 [Sheppard] [74:6] to [74:25].\n\n147.\n\nDuring the first day of the Hearing on Annulment, the Applicants further argued that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its finding in paragraph 508, namely that international public policy was engaged on the facts it found.144 According to the Applicants, the Tribunal created its own notion of international public policy without proper reasoning and failed to explain why the *Minnotte* factors were part of the international public policy (an argument which the Respondent never made) and how the Claimants' conduct amounted to deliberately or unreasonably ignoring fraud or forgery.145 According to the Applicants, while they were found guilty of lack of diligence, this is not the same as a finding that they had unreasonably ignored fraud.146\n\nTr.

Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: No serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention provides for a high threshold for annulment, requiring both that the rule breached be \"fundamental\" and that the breach be \"serious.\"147\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 125 and 126; see also paras. 127-144.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest that a breach of the right to be heard and a clear violation of a rule of evidence (such as the reversal of the burden of proof) may, in specific circumstances, be relevant under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent however notes that the ICSID jurisprudence relied upon by the Applicants has recognized that tribunals can choose the bases for their decisions without breaching the parties' right to be heard (provided that these bases fall within the legal framework of the dispute and do not consist of issues that were not invoked, argued or anticipated by the parties).148 The Respondent further notes that no award has ever been annulled due to a reversal of the burden of proof, and that ICSID committees have found that a mere disagreement or dissatisfaction with the tribunal's evaluation of the evidence cannot be a basis for finding a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.149\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 128-136.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 137-141.\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent claims that, in order to be \"serious,\" a breach must have had a material impact on the outcome of the award, meaning that it must have caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from that it would have awarded had the rule been observed.150\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 142-144.\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that no serious breach of due process occurred in the present case because the Tribunal gave the Parties a full, fair and equal opportunity to present their case (and produce evidence) and based the Award on a theory that the Parties had discussed in the document authenticity phase.151\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 131 and 136.\n\n**a. The** ***Minnotte*** **Direction**\n---------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not deny the Applicants the right to be heard when it invited the Parties' comments on *Minnotte* without authorizing the submission of new evidence.152\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 145-163; Rejoinder, paras. 13-75.\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the *Minnotte* Direction did not raise new issues outside of the scope of the document authenticity phase as shaped by PO13, PO15 and PO20.153 In particular, in the Respondent's view, the *Minnotte* test was part of the State's case throughout the document authenticity phase,154 since both \"due diligence\" and \"deliberate closing of eyes\" were factors encompassed in the broader concept of good faith that was at the basis of the Claimants' defence to the Forgery Dismissal Application,155 and that was addressed in the document authenticity phase as part of the \"legal consequences\" of forgery.156 The Respondent argues that, in the document authenticity phase, the Applicants submitted substantial evidence on their due diligence (on which they thereafter relied in their briefs on *Minnotte*), and at no time did they indicate that they wished to submit additional evidence (or seek leave to reopen the proceedings or supplement their submissions).157 In the Respondent's view, by the *Minnotte* Direction, the Tribunal simply sought the Parties' views on a legal authority that was not cited by them, but that was consistent with other authorities on the record.158\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 104-109; Rejoinder, paras. 47-52.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 110-115, and para. 149; see also Annex A to the Counter-Memorial.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 47-65.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 49, 50, and 53.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 145, and 150-156; Rejoinder, paras. 53-65; see also paras. 66-75.\n\nRejoinder, para. 66.\n\n154.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicants concede that, in the arbitration, they submitted evidence regarding their good faith and the subsidiary issues of due diligence and failure to perceive the fraud.159 The Respondent argues that the Applicants never protested that they had made only a limited showing regarding the issue of due diligence. Rather, they presented evidence allegedly confirming their extensive due diligence, the Respondent rebutted this evidence and submitted evidence confirming that the Claimants were either complicit or at least knew (or should have known) of the fraud. Based on the evidence on the record, the Tribunal concluded that Ridlatama was the author of the forgery and the fraud.160 According to the Respondent, the Applicants cannot now relitigate the Tribunal's factual finding.161\n\nRejoinder, para. 54.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 54-57.\n\nRejoinder, para. 57.\n\n155.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that the Applicants' proffer of Mr. Mazak's testimony is belated (as is their offer to submit expert testimony regarding the due diligence exercised by a reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector) given that they could have called Mr. Mazak as a witness in the arbitration (or presented expert witnesses) but chose not to do so.162 The Respondent further claims that Mr. Mazak's testimony is duplicative and partial, and the proposed expert testimony would not have been material to the outcome of the case.163\n\nRejoinder, paras. 58-64.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 59-64.\n\n156.\n\nIn any case, according to the Respondent, the *Minnotte* factors (due diligence and closing of the eyes) were not dispositive to the case as the Tribunal reached its finding on inadmissibility based only on the seriousness and extent of the forgery, the general principle of good faith and the prohibition of abuse of process.164 The Respondent further argues that the Tribunal did not adopt (or decide based on) the *Minnotte* test (proposed by the Claimants),165 and that the same finding would have been reached based on numerous authorities relied upon by the Respondent.166\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 157-159.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 70-74.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 66-74.\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the *Minnotte* Direction did not change the applicable legal framework.167 The Respondent also claims that the Applicants not only argued that the *Minnotte* Direction was within the analytical framework of the admissibility phase, but also asserted that the evidentiary record in the arbitration established that they were good faith investors under *Minnotte*. Since Churchill and Planet chose not to raise an objection to the *Minnotte* Direction with the Tribunal, they have waived their right to raise this objection as a ground for annulment.168\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 148-150; Rejoinder, paras. 39-52.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 20-38.\n\n**b. The re-admission of Mr. Noor's evidence**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal did not readmit Mr. Noor's witness statement and that the Applicants misread the Award in connection to Mr. Noor's evidence.169\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 164-170; Rejoinder, paras. 113-116.\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, in paragraph 84 of the Award, the Tribunal expressly stated that it disregarded Mr. Noor's witness statement. The reference to Mr. Noor's testimony in paragraph 165 of the Award does not show that the Tribunal relied upon this testimony but merely that the State referred to it in support of its arguments on the invalidity of the upgrades.170 Furthermore, in the Respondent's view, the wording \"misguided assumption\" in paragraph 512 of the Award can be explained in light of the fact that the Tribunal had found that the forged documents were fabricated to give an impression of lawful entitlement and this false impression was then used to obtain the Exploitation Licenses.171 The Respondent objects to the Applicants' statement that, without Mr. Noor's testimony, no evidence existed on the impact of the forged documents on his state of mind, and argues that, in light of the established forgery, the only plausible conclusion was that the exploitation upgrades were granted on the erroneous assumption that the mining licences were valid.172\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 164-170.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 113-116.\n\nRejoinder, para. 115.\n\n160.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that, in light of the Tribunal's finding in paragraph 530 of the Award (namely that the Exploitation Licenses were embedded in a fraudulent scheme), Mr. Noor's state of mind was irrelevant to the question of admissibility.173\n\nRejoinder, para. 116.\n\n**c. The reversal of the burden of proof in relation to fraud and deception and to the** ***Minnotte*** **factors**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the Tribunal did not reverse the burden of proof nor put on the Applicants the burden of proving forgery, deception or the *Minnotte* factors.174\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 181-189.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal did not require the Applicants to *disprove* that the exploitation upgrades were the product of deception.175 According to the Respondent, the finding in paragraph 522 of the Award can be explained in the context of the Tribunal's assessment of the Claimants' conduct in supervising the licensing process and is based on Messrs. Quinlivan, Benjamin, and Gunter's testimonies as well as on the Respondent's arguments.176 In particular, the finding on the existence of a fraudulent scheme permeating the Claimants' investments in the EKCP was based on the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence on record and not on a reversal of the burden of proof.177\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 181-186.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 182-184.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 186.\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Tribunal put on it the burden of proving the *Minnotte* factors. Specifically, the Respondent points to paragraph 244 of the Award, wherein the Tribunal stated that the Respondent carried the burden to prove its case on forgery and fraud, and notes that the *Minnotte* factors were part of its case. The Respondent further argues that, in the arbitration, it elaborated a benchmark to assess the Claimants' conduct, which the Tribunal accepted. By applying this standard to the facts of the case, the Tribunal found that the Claimants lacked diligence in overseeing the licensing process and investigating the allegations of forgery (paragraphs 504, 506, 508-509, and 516-527 of the Award).178\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 187-189.\n\n**d. The Infection Issue**\n--------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Tribunal breached the Applicants' right to be heard on the Infection Issue.179\n\nRejoinder, para. 99.\n\n165.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal placed no restrictions on the Parties' submissions on the validity of the Exploitation Licenses under Indonesian law180 (and no common understanding existed that the Tribunal would reserve judgment on this issue until a later stage of the proceedings).181 The Respondent argues that nothing in PO13, PO15 or PO20 prevented the Applicants from rebutting the Respondent's argument that under Indonesian law a forged mining license cannot be upgraded182 or required that the Infection Issue be addressed in a subsequent phase. In particular, while PO20 directed the Parties not to address the Infection Issue in the post-hearing briefs, it also indicated that the Parties could address all matters which they deemed appropriate to further their positions.183 In the Respondent's view, the Applicants made the decision (\"no doubt after careful consideration\") not to address the Respondent's argument (or present evidence on the operation of the Indonesian mining law and the general principles of Indonesian law) and to argue for deferring that issue to a later phase, and they cannot now complain of it.184\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 176.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 43, 44, 101 and 102.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 173, and 175-179; Rejoinder, para. 103.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 173, and 177-179.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 173; Rejoinder, para. 104.\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent also claims that the Applicants fail to explain how they were injured by the Tribunal's decision not to address the Infection Issue.185 In the Respondent's view, in light of the Tribunal's finding in paragraph 530 of the Award (namely, that claims based on the Exploitation Licenses are not entitled to protection as a matter of international law), the Infection Issue was immaterial to the outcome of the case.186 The Respondent further notes that the Applicants themselves argued, in the arbitration, that international law was determinative if the exploitation upgrades were found invalid under Indonesian law.187\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 180.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 180; Rejoinder, para. 105.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 180; see also paras. 101 and 102.\n\n**e. Denial of justice**\n------------------------\n\n167.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fact that the Claimants were not given the chance to brief their claim for denial of justice is not a breach of the right to be heard but the natural consequence of the dismissal of the Claimants' claims due to their inadmissibility. In particular, the Respondent notes that the Tribunal decided to resolve the threshold issue of admissibility in a preliminary phase exactly to avoid the need to adjudicate claims that could not, as a matter of law, survive a finding of forgery.188\n\nRejoinder, para. 121.\n\n**f. State responsibility**\n---------------------------\n\n168.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicants' argument on State responsibility \"comes far too late\" because, during the arbitration, they never protested that they were denied the opportunity to adduce evidence on the State's involvement in the fraud.189 In the Respondent's view, the Applicants had every opportunity in the arbitration to provide evidence supporting their theory about the State's alleged bad faith. Accordingly, while the Applicants \"may regret having poorly prosecuted their case,\" this cannot be a ground for annulment of the Award.190\n\nRejoinder, para. 96.\n\nRejoinder, para. 97.\n\n**ii. Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: No manifest excess of powers**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that the term \"manifest\" in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention means \"obvious, clear or easily recognizable,\" but argues that a manifest excess of powers only warrants annulment if it was \"serious or material to the outcome of the case.\"191 The Respondent also points out that in ICSID practice, a failure to apply the law chosen by the parties can give rise to annulment under Article 52(1)(b), while a misapplication or erroneous interpretation of that law cannot.192\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 192-194; Tr. Day 2 [Frutos Peterson] [90:12] to [90:14].\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 195-197. Tr. Day 2 [Frutos Peterson] [90:14] to [90:17].\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent responds to the three main arguments under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention put forward in the Applicants' written briefs as follows.\n\n171.\n\nFirst, the Respondent denies that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by not deciding the Infection Issue.193 The Respondent points to paragraph 235 of the Award wherein the Tribunal ruled that, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, it was for it to determine what issues were governed by national or international law.194 The Respondent further points to paragraph 488 of the Award, wherein the Tribunal ruled that the consequences of the forgery and fraud were to be assessed in light of the \"principles of international law,\"195 as the Applicants also argued in the arbitration.196 Applying these principles - the Respondent states - the Tribunal found that, as a matter of international law, the Claimants could not claim protection for investments tainted by fraud and forgery. In this context, the validity of the exploitation upgrades under Indonesian law was irrelevant to the Tribunal's finding on inadmissibility, and deciding the Infection Issue would not have changed the outcome of the Tribunal's analysis.197 According to the Respondent, the Applicants' argument is nothing more than a disagreement with the Tribunal's application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment,198 and the Committee cannot second guess the Tribunal's legal theory on forgery (nor the Tribunal's application of this theory).199 The Respondent further argues that, in any event, the Tribunal's interpretation of international law would have overridden a potential conclusion that the Exploitation Licenses were valid under Indonesian law.200\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 198-212; Rejoinder, paras. 105-111.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 209.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 209.\n\nRejoinder, para. 106.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 210; Rejoinder, paras. 106-111.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 208.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 211.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 208; Rejoinder, paras. 107-112.\n\n172.\n\nSecond, the Respondent denies that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply State responsibility. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal properly applied the relevant principles of international law when it found that the Claimants' claims were inadmissible.201 The Respondent argues, in particular, that Article 7 of the ILC Articles was not applicable to the case given that this provision only concerns the *liability* of the State for internationally wrongful acts committed by its organs or agents,202 and the Tribunal rejected the Claimants' bad faith and corruption theories on factual grounds203 (identifying Ridlatama as the author of the forgeries with the assistance of a mid-level Regency official).204\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 82-93; Rejoinder, paras. 76-81.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 84 and 85.\n\nRejoinder, para. 83.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 77-81\n\n173.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, Article 7 of the ILC Articles does not apply to the threshold question of whether the investor's claims are admissible, and international tribunals (including *Metal-Tech* and *World Duty Free*) have found that the State's involvement in a wrongdoing does not preclude a finding of inadmissibility.205 The Respondent further contends that, even if the relevance of Article 7 of the ILC Articles were debatable, this would not be sufficient to demonstrate that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply this provision.206 In any event, even if the entire dismissal of the Claimants' case benefited the Respondent, an award cannot be annulled based on the (un)fairness or the (in)correctness of the legal principles applied by the Tribunal.207\n\nRejoinder, paras. 86-92.\n\nRejoinder, para. 93.\n\nRejoinder, para. 90.\n\n174.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by failing to address the Applicants' claim on unjust enrichment.208 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not need to examine the merits of this claim because it had already ruled that the Claimants were not good faith investors under international law and their unjust enrichment claim was therefore inadmissible.209 The Respondent argues that a disagreement with the Tribunal's finding cannot constitute a ground for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and a Tribunal's finding on a point of law cannot be subject to reconsideration by the Committee.210\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 219-222; Rejoinder, paras. 118 and 119.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 220; Rejoinder, paras. 118 and 119.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 222.\n\n**iii. Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: No failure to state reasons**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention sets forth a very high threshold to annul an award and does not permit any inquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of the reasons provided in it.211 In particular, the Respondent argues that an award cannot be annulled if the reader can understand the facts and the law applied by the tribunal in coming to its conclusion.212 In the Respondent's view, tribunals need not address every single argument raised by the parties, and a committee cannot transform a review under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which an award is based.213 Finally, the Respondent notes that, while a breach of Article 52(1)(e) may occur if a tribunal fails to address (or ignores) highly relevant evidence, this circumstance is irrelevant to the present case as the Applicants have not alleged that the Tribunal failed to address relevant evidence on which they had placed significant emphasis.214\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 225.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 226 and 227.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 228, 229 and 231.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 230.\n\n176.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicants illegitimately endeavour to reargue the merits of arguments raised during the document authenticity phase.215 The Respondent further contends that:\n\na. The Tribunal did not readmit the witness statement of Mr. Noor nor give weight to it; accordingly, the Award does not fail to provide reasons nor contain contradictory reasons in this regard;216\n\nb. In paragraph 530 of the Award, the Tribunal explained the reasons why there was no need to determine the validity of the Exploitation Licenses under Indonesian law; these reasons are sufficient to understand the premise for the Tribunal's finding that the Infection Issue was moot;217\n\nc. In paragraphs 504 and 506 of the Award, the Tribunal formulated the benchmark against which the Claimants' due diligence was to be assessed; based on this benchmark and the evidence in the record, the Tribunal explained why it was not persuaded that the Applicants had conducted an extensive and exhaustive due diligence (paragraphs 517 to 527); accordingly, the Tribunal's finding in this regard is not arbitrary;218\n\nd. The Tribunal could legitimately reconsider its decision on the production of the Police Files (considering that the Claimants had not objected to its decision of May 12, 2015, and that a tribunal may reconsider its previous decisions); furthermore, the Tribunal provided reasons for not drawing adverse inferences from the non-production of the Police Files as it stated that these documents were covered by the secrecy of criminal investigations (paragraphs 245 to 250 of the Award); the Respondent further argues that tribunals are the judges of the admissibility, relevance and weight of the evidence and their decisions cannot be revaluated by *ad hoc* committees; in any event, according to the Respondent, the adverse inferences requested by the Claimants (prior to and after the 2015 Hearing) were not supported by the evidence on record;219\n\ne. The Applicants have failed to establish that the Award should be annulled for failure to state reasons on State responsibility; according to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not need to decide issues regarding the attribution of an official's conduct to the State given that it dismissed the Applicants' claims due to inadmissibility; furthermore, the Tribunal had no obligation to address Article 7 of the ILC Articles because this provision is irrelevant to the question of admissibility;220\n\nf. In paragraph 531 of the Award, the Tribunal provided reasons for the dismissal of the unjust enrichment claim and addressed the question of nexus; in particular, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal's reasoning (while succinct) can be followed in its progress from point to point because the Tribunal explained (also in paragraphs 474-477, 488-508, and 510-531 of the Award) that: (i) the EKCP was tainted by fraud and forgery; (ii) all Claimants' claims related to the EKCP; and therefore (iii) all Claimants' claims were inadmissible as a matter of international law;221\n\ng. In paragraphs 507, 528 and 529 of the Award, the Tribunal provided reasons for disposing of the IP claim, noting that this claim derived from the EKCP, which was coated in forgery and fraud and for this reason was inadmissible;222 and\n\nh. The Tribunal provided reasons to dismiss the Claimants' claim on denial of justice as mentioned in sub-point g above; furthermore, the Respondent notes that this claim referred to proceedings instituted by Ridlatama before the Samarinda Administrative Court in connection with the revocation of the mining licenses and to which the Applicants were not parties.223\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 223 and 224.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 232; Rejoinder, paras. 113-116.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 233 and 234; Rejoinder, para. 112.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 235-237.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 238-244.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 245; Rejoinder, paras. 94 and 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 246-251.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 252 and 253.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 254-257; Rejoinder, para. 120.\n\n**V. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: Serious departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThere is no question that 'equal treatment of the parties' and 'the right to be heard' are both fundamental rules of procedure which are part and parcel of the right to a fair trial, and the Parties also agree that the 'burden of proof' may constitute another fundamental rule of procedure for purposes of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. For the most part, however, the Parties' dispute does not turn on how these fundamental rules are interpreted as a matter of theory, but rather how they were applied by the Tribunal on the specific facts of this case. The only area in which there appeared to be some difference at the level of theory is with respect to the *scope* of the right to be heard. At the Hearing on Annulment, the Committee asked the Parties in particular whether for purposes of the ICSID Convention the standard should be seen as requiring a \"full opportunity\" or simply a \"reasonable opportunity\" to be heard, bearing in mind the shift in Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules from the former to the latter.224 In the Applicants' view, the scope of the right to be heard within both the UNCITRAL and ICSID systems must be understood at the fuller end of the scale, namely as ensuring a full opportunity for the parties to present their case.225 According to the Respondent, the expression \"full opportunity\" indicates that a party must be granted a \"reasonable opportunity\" to be heard, and not that a party is entitled to present as many arguments and much evidence as it sees fit.226 In any case, in the Respondent's view, even if the two standards were different, both tests would be met in this case as the Applicants had a \"genuine opportunity to be heard\" during the arbitration.227\n\nArticle 17 of UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010; Tr. Day 1 [Kalicki] [196:25] to [197:21].\n\nTr. Day 2 [Luttrell] [37:19] to [45:4].\n\nTr. Day 2 [Frutos Peterson] [72:11] to [74:18].\n\nTr. Day 2 [Frutos Peterson] [73:14] to [73:16].\n\n178.\n\nIn the view of this Committee, Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention does not stand alone but can be interpreted in light of other sources. This includes Article 17 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which contains a principle which reflects a general standard.228 In any case, the principle of \"full opportunity\" to be heard, which is favoured by the Applicants, would still need to be interpreted reasonably, namely as requiring tribunals to provide each party with an adequate opportunity to be heard but not necessarily with an unlimited opportunity to present its case. In this perspective, the right to be heard is commonly considered as not absolute, but rather subject to possible limitations, provided that they are reasonable and proportional to the aim to be achieved.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Kalicki] [196:25] to [197:21]; Tr. Day 2 [Luttrell] [37:19] to [45:25].\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee also notes that the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport v. Philippines* (\"*Fraport*\") referred to international human rights instruments as a source of content of the right to be heard, and recalled that international courts have found that the right to present one's case \"require[s] the tribunal to afford both parties the opportunity to make submissions where new evidence is received and considered by the tribunal to be relevant to its final deliberations.\"229 Even if *ad hoc* committees operate within the ICSID Convention, the reference to the jurisprudence of specialized courts which are an integral part of human rights treaties fosters the consistency of the content of the right to be heard and strengthens the effectiveness of this concept. It also enhances the legitimacy of the interpretation by linking it to the broader body of international law. The substance of the right to be heard has been described in terms that are commonly accepted by the *ad hoc* committee in *Wena v. Egypt* (\"*Wena*\"):\n\n[Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention] refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.230\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, para. 202 (Exhibit ALA-08).\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, December 8, 2000, para. 57 (RLA-ANN-288).\n\n180.\n\nWith this understanding of the right to be heard, the Committee also observes that Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention requires a \"serious departure\" from that right. The Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in *Mine v. Guinea* that under this formulation, \"the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit of the protection which the rule was intended to provide\"231. In the context of the right to be heard, however, this does not require a finding that the deprivation of the right necessarily led to a different outcome in the case. Article 52(1)(d) provides a remedy for procedural injustice that can be triggered for a material breach. The right to be heard guarantees participation in the administration of evidence, irrespective of the Applicant's chances of obtaining a different result. The test turns on the fundamental nature of the rule of procedure and the seriousness of its violation. A grave violation of a fundamental rule is likely to more or less automatically result in an injury, inasmuch as such party is deprived of the due process protections which the rule is intended to provide.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, para. 5.05 (Exhibit ALA-09).\n\n**i. The** ***Minnotte*** **Direction**\n---------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nAs a threshold issue, the Respondent contends that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 27, the Applicants are estopped from raising any impropriety pertaining to the *Minnotte* Direction as they failed to raise any objection with the Tribunal that *Minnotte* raised issues that were outside the scope of the document authenticity phase.232 The Applicants stress that the impropriety arose not from the Tribunal's invitation to comment on *Minnotte*, but from ignoring their protest that further evidence would be needed and disposing of the claims without giving them an opportunity to present their case on the facts relevant to the *Minnotte* test.233\n\nRejoinder, paras. 20-38.\n\nReply, para. 42.\n\n182.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* recognized that Arbitration Rule 27 on waiver to object illustrates a more general rule, common to all award control systems, that a party forfeits its right to seek annulment if it has failed to raise promptly its objection to the tribunal's procedure upon becoming aware of it.234 The Committee notes that Churchill and Planet discussed the *Minnotte* invitation without objection in the first place, but this fact cannot be taken as a waiver of their right to try to demonstrate later that the Tribunal committed annullable error in *the particular way* it ultimately applied the *Minnotte* factors in its Award, to support a decision of inadmissibility. In their reply submission on *Minnotte* of October 11, 2016, Churchill and Planet did declare that the Respondent had changed its case multiple times over the two previous years, and that they had been dragged with the Tribunal further and further off the course charted in PO15.235 Moreover, the Applicants had made an early, albeit unsuccessful, complaint about the management of the document authenticity phase, when they objected that PO13 violated their fundamental due process rights and constituted unequal treatment of the Parties.236 For these reasons, the Committee accepts that the Applicants are not barred from challenging the Award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.237\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 204-208 (Exhibit ALA-08).\n\nExhibit A-44, para. 4.\n\n\"It is patently violative of Claimants' right to due process for the Tribunal to reopen a decided issue on the merits without notifying the Claimants of its intention to do so, or inviting Claimants to address the substance of that issue,\" Exhibit A-12, p. 13.\n\nThe Committee notes that, at the end of the 2015 Hearing, following the President's statement that \"this is the time to complain about the conduct of this arbitration\", the Parties confirmed that they had no complaints. In the Committee's view, the Applicants' statement must be interpreted as an expression of satisfaction about the way the 2015 Hearing was conducted and not as an abandonment of their grievances (Exhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [221:3] to [221:13]).\n\n183.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations after the 2015 Hearing, the Tribunal issued the *Minnotte* Direction instructing the Parties to comment on specific points of international law arising out of this authority, but only on the basis of the evidence in the record and subject to a 15-page limit. These specific points were identified as follows:\n\n(i) the admissibility in international law of claims tainted by fraud or forgery where the alleged perpetrator is a third party, (ii) the lack of due care or negligence of the investor to investigate the factual circumstances surrounding the making of an investment, and (iii) the deliberate closing of the eyes to indications of serious misconduct or crime, or an unreasonable failure to perceive such indications.238\n\nExhibit A-41, p. 2.\n\n184.\n\nAs mentioned above, Churchill and Planet declared in their reply submissions of October 11, 2016 on *Minnotte* that the Respondent's motion no longer could be labelled as a mere admissibility challenge, but had evolved to become \"an omnibus objection comprising elements of jurisdiction, liability and quantum, underpinned by baseless allegations of forgery, fraud, and corruption; bad faith; misconduct on foreign stock exchanges; and misleading and deceptive behaviour by the Claimants and their counsel.\"239 In support of this statement, Churchill and Planet referred to all of the State's post-hearing submissions,240 including but not limited to the State's submission of September 27, 2016 on *Minnotte*.241 They concluded that the Parties were now debating factual and legal issues well outside the intended scope of the document authenticity phase, and the volume and nature of these issues were such \"that they can only be properly briefed, investigated and determined in a full merits phase.\"242\n\nExhibit A-44, para. 1.\n\nExhibit A-44, fn. 2-8.\n\nExhibit A-43.\n\nExhibit A-44, para. 4.\n\n185.\n\nDirections made within its discretion by an arbitral tribunal regarding the scope and admission of evidence have an impact on the discharge of the burden of proof. The Applicants essentially argue that the Tribunal limited the Parties to the old factual record243 when the *Minnotte* factors, due care and deliberate closing of the eyes, were determinative of the outcome of the Award. In their view, it was thus unfair to hold them to the existing record when the Tribunal entered into a factual inquiry that had never been part of the document authenticity phase.244 Notwithstanding the Applicants' contention that the Tribunal exercised its power in a manner that limited their freedom of action, the Committee finds that the Applicants could present their case on the *Minnotte* factors without their right to produce evidence in support of their contentions have been impaired as will be now examined.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [48:5] to [48:10].\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [39:17] to [39:19].\n\n186.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the State's Forgery Dismissal Application made no mention of due diligence or willful blindness and that, throughout the arbitration, the State had repeatedly contended that the state of mind and good faith of the Claimants were not relevant.245 The Applicants further contend that the Parties did not file evidence, which they contend was critical, on the due diligence practice of investors in the Indonesian mining sector in 2006-2010. They admit that they nonetheless did present arguments on due diligence, but allege that these were made for different purposes than addressing the *Minnotte* factors, including in support of their claim for estoppel based on the State's alleged recognition of the validity of the disputed licenses.246 However, the Applicants cannot object belatedly to the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence they presented on the basis that they now wish they might have submitted more. The fact that Churchill and Planet did submit evidence and arguments on due care reflects the fact that they evidently had the opportunity to do so.\n\nReply, para. 5.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [48:8] to [49:7]; Annulment Application, paras. 89-91; see also Exhibit A-26(1), paras. 126131.\n\n187.\n\nPleadings cannot be ignored in deciding whether a party has been able to discharge the burden of proof. In their first submission on *Minnotte* of September 23, 2016, Churchill and Planet discussed the issue of due diligence in the factual circumstances surrounding the making of the investments. They declared that the scope of due diligence is a matter for the business concerned and that, where the level of due diligence is at issue, the appropriate measure must be what a reasonably prudent investor would do in the circumstances. Here, they said, the record showed that they conducted extensive due diligence on their investments, both prior to making those investments and during the course of their operation and, in contrast to the investors in *Minnotte*, they were active and visible on the ground. They added, however, that forged signatures were not a foreseeable risk when they made their investments.247\n\nExhibit A-42, paras. 11, 12, and 16.\n\n188.\n\nThe Applicants contend that, in the arbitration record, there was virtually no evidence as to the second factor (deliberate closing of eyes) given that this factor had not been relevant in the document authenticity phase.248 However, the Award evaluates the standard of \"willful blindness\" (or deliberate closing of the eyes) by focusing on the level of institutional control and oversight exercised by Churchill and Planet in relation to the licensing process, whether they were put on notice by evidence of fraud that a reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector should have investigated, and whether or not they took the appropriate corrective steps.249 The Tribunal held that, in light of the heightened degree of diligence that one would expect of an investor in the risky coal mining environment in Indonesia, of which the Claimants were aware, there was evidence on record confirming that Churchill and Planet had not verified the representations made by Ridlatama; that, notably, no one performed any oversight function of the licensing process; that the Claimants failed to exercise due diligence when indications of forgery first came to light in the BPK 2009 public audit report; and that verification of the Ridlatama licenses by the Indonesian law firm of STP, which was hired to conduct due diligence, did not assess the authenticity of the signatures.250 In reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal attached to the evidence on record the probative value it believed that evidence deserved. Questions relating to the evaluation of evidence are subject to the primacy of the arbitrators' judgment and are not reviewable by *ad hoc* committees under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [49:18] to [49:22].\n\nAward, para. 504.\n\nAward, paras. 517-527.\n\n189.\n\nThe Applicants add that good faith is the operative principle in the *Minnotte* test in connection with the admissibility in international law of claims tainted by fraud or forgery.251 However, they say, any evidence on good faith was excluded by the Tribunal in PO15 when it made clear that the facts allegedly justifying estoppel were not to be addressed during the document authenticity phase.252 It is trite law that, in order to exercise its fact-finding power, a tribunal may request the parties to produce documents or provide explanations or use expert opinions. Contrary to what the Applicants allege,253 the Tribunal did not have to allow new evidence on the standards of due diligence of a reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector or to determine the factual aspects of *Minnotte* in a subsequent phase or with the merits. The Tribunal found in the record what it believed to be sufficient evidence of Churchill and Planet's absence of diligence. True, before the *Minnotte* direction, the evidence on record could not be used in support of the specific inquiries raised in there by the Tribunal, but this is precisely the reason why the Tribunal, respectful of the Parties' rights of defense, consulted them on *Minnotte* and asked them to use the evidence in the record if they wished to refer to facts in addressing the Tribunal's questions. The Applicants have not demonstrated that the Tribunal's use of its authority to investigate the facts and weigh the evidence flouted the equality of the Parties or their right to present their defenses. Allegations that the Tribunal's approach was driven by a concern about further delaying its deliberations after a year already had expired since the 2015 Hearing, or by embarrassment at the prospect of reopening the document authenticity phase to take new evidence on the *Minnotte* factors which would have shown its earlier scoping of this phase to have been flawed,254 are unfounded assumptions on the part of the Applicants.\n\nReply, para. 37; see Exhibit A-42, paras. 2-7.\n\nReply, para. 37; see Exhibit A-16, paras. 34 and 35.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 98.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 103.\n\n190.\n\nThe Applicants now suggest that there is \"a raft of witness and documentary evidence\" that they could have adduced but did not, principally including the testimony of Mr. Mazak, then managing director of Churchill.255 In their reply submission on *Minnotte* of October 11, 2016, Churchill and Planet objected that the State had raised fresh allegations of bad faith and forgery against them and Mr. Mazak despite giving no indication prior to the 2015 Hearing that it had questions for Mr. Mazak; they labelled this approach \"prosecutor ambush.\"256 Churchill and Planet had not presented Mr. Mazak as a witness, the Award notes, \"since they offered the most appropriate witnesses to respond to Indonesia's case on authenticity as it stood prior to the hearing, i.e. that the Claimants were dupes fooled by Ridlatama, not that they were fraudsters as Indonesia now contends.\"257 The Committee notes that, even after Churchill and Planet (prior to the 2015 Hearing, in their reply to the Forgery Dismissal Application) described the State's case as one alleging fraud rather than forgery,258 they still did not present Mr. Mazak as witness to rebut these allegations, notwithstanding every opportunity they had to do so. In these circumstances, the Applicants may not posit at the annulment stage an alternate factual record which might have existed, composed of evidence which could have been - but was not - submitted to the Tribunal for consideration.\n\nReply, paras. 58-68.\n\nExhibit A-44, fn. 24.\n\nAward, para. 206.\n\nExhibit A-26(1), para. 10.\n\n191.\n\nThe Applicants also allege that the *Minnotte* Direction changed the legal framework of the document authenticity phase, which the Tribunal managed in a way that was the source of many annullable errors.259 The Applicants declare that the Tribunal failed to define the expression \"legal consequences\" that first appeared in PO13, which reconsidered PO12 and decided to address document authenticity issues as a matter of priority.260\n\nReply, paras. 40-47.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 52-62; see also Exhibit A-8, paras. 47, 49, 50, and 52.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal remarked in PO13 that Churchill and Planet, although twice invited to do so,261 had chosen not to address the question about the fate of their claims in case of a finding of forgery.262 The Tribunal determined that the issue of the document authenticity should be addressed as a preliminary matter and \"that, in the context of the document authenticity phase, the Parties are to address in their written submissions and at the hearing all factual aspects relating to forgery as well as the legal consequences of a finding of forgery on each claim.\"263 The Tribunal added that these directions did \"not mean to prevent the Parties from addressing any other matters which they deem appropriate in connection with the forgery allegations and arguments.\"264 Churchill and Planet applied for reconsideration on November 23, 2014 on the grounds that PO13 violated their fundamental due process rights and constituted unequal treatment of the Parties.265 On January 12, 2015, the Tribunal rejected their request in PO15, and reaffirmed PO13 on the scope of the authenticity phase:\n\nas comprising (i) the factual aspects of forgery and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery. Accordingly, the document authenticity phase was defined as being limited to (i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or not (including especially who signed the documents and how) and (ii) legal submissions on the positions in law in a scenario where there would be forgery (including for instance the legal requirements for estoppel, as opposed to the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel).266\n\nExhibits A-7 (Telephone conference of the Tribunal with the Parties of October 21, 2014) and A-10 (Churchill and Planet's letter of November 10, 2014 to the Tribunal).\n\nExhibit A-11, para. 26.\n\nExhibit A-11, paras. 27, 28, and 33.\n\nExhibit A-11, para. 28.\n\n\"It is patently violative of Claimants' right to due process for the Tribunal to reopen a decided issue on the merits without notifying the Claimants of its intention to do so, or inviting Claimants to address the substance of that issue,\" Exhibit A-12, p. 13.\n\nExhibit A-16, para. 34.\n\n193.\n\nIn PO15, the Tribunal stated that it considered that it had \"fully respected the Claimants' due process rights in connection with the issuance of PO13, by giving the Claimants an opportunity to be heard, which [...] was not subject to any limitation as to its scope,\" and that Churchill and Planet had limited their comments to a mention of estoppel and of their right to recover amounts invested in good faith.267\n\nExhibit A-16, para. 23.\n\n194.\n\n\"Legal consequences\" were again considered at the end of the 2015 Hearing on certain procedural aspects of the questions to be addressed in post-hearing briefs. The President explained that:\n\n[t]he point for asking legal consequences, which was a kind of add-on to the factual authenticity question, was that we heard very divergent views from the parties [\u2026] So that is why we wanted you to canvas the legal consequences so we could see where we were going if we have no authenticity, or we have authentic documents.268\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [205:21] to [206:7].\n\n195.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal clarified as follows with regard to one of the questions to be addressed in the post-hearing briefs regarding the legal consequences on each Party's case in the event the signatures on the general survey and exploration license, as well as on other official documents, were not handwritten or not authorized:\n\nit is not whether [...] if the document is null and void or forged, whether then you can say there is unjust enrichment, or acquiescence. That is not at all what we had in mind [\u2026] The Tribunal would simply try and understand if it has to be written [and signed by hand] and [if] it's not hand signed, what is [sic] the legal consequences if it is not authentic, because it's a forged document?269\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [209:18] to [210:2].\n\n196.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal prefaced her conclusion of the discussion with the statement that:\n\nthe tribunal must stick to the definition of the phase like it described it in its procedural order, and that was the authenticity as a matter of fact, factual question of whether the impugned documents are authentic or not, who signed them and how, \"how\" was meant in very broad fashion, about the circumstances, authority and so on. And then legal submissions on the position in law in a scenario where there would be forgery, including, for instance, the legal requirement for estoppel, as opposed to the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel. For instance, we have not, at least in the tribunal's understanding, heard evidence on whether someone relied, rightly or not, on some assertion, some assurance given.270\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [205:6] to [205:20].\n\n197.\n\nWhen the discussion resumed at the end of the 2015 Hearing about the availability of estoppel, acquiescence and other legal doctrines as a result of a finding of forgery, the President of the Tribunal further explained:\n\nthere are different levels of legal consequences that we are discussing here. If the documents are forged and there are no licenses, then the question arises, what arguments does [sic] the claimants have? It could, for instance, have an estoppel argument that the State cannot raise the invalidity of the licenses. It is a different question to examine and decide whether the forgery of certain licenses has a direct effect on the validity of others [...] I understood this so far to be part of this debate here. The estoppel [...] and similar doctrines were not part of this debate, except to canvas what the legal consequences could be.271\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [215:6] to [215:18].\n\n198.\n\nIn reply to Churchill and Planet's counsel, the President of the Tribunal declared that the Tribunal did not want to hear submissions on \"the international law parts,\" including estoppel, at that stage.272\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [218:4].\n\n199.\n\nOn August 20, 2015, the Tribunal issued PO20 inviting, as discussed at the 2015 Hearing, the Parties to address in their post-hearing briefs *inter alia* the consequences of disregarding Mr. Noor's evidence and, assuming that the Tribunal were to conclude that the impugned documents were not authentic or not authorized, what issues would remain to be resolved in fact and law. The Tribunal confirmed in PO20:\n\nthat the Parties are to address matters falling within the scope of Procedural Order No. 15 especially paragraph 34. In other words, the Parties shall address (i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or not and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery. Matter (i) includes the question whether, if they were not hand-written, the impugned signatures were affixed with authority. Matter (ii) about the legal position in the event of forgery does not cover the effect of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses on the exploitation licenses. The present directions come in lieu of any different comments made by the Tribunal at the hearing.273\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 5.\n\n200.\n\nOrganization and control of the presentation of pleadings and evidence by laying down guidelines, such as the questions identified in PO20 for the post-hearing briefs,274 are within a tribunal's mission and powers. The Applicants say they understood that PO13 and PO15 asked them simply to identify the legal principles, such as estoppel, that could be engaged if there was a finding of forgery, but with the further understanding that they would be allowed to expand on these issues at a later stage.275 The Committee considers that a combined reading of PO15 and PO20 shows that the Tribunal did not wish to inquire about the facts on estoppel, and made no ruling on estoppel in the Award. Instead, the Tribunal accepted in the Award the State's argument that failure to conduct proper diligence precluded Churchill and Planet from even *invoking* estoppel (or acquiescence): \"the general principle of good faith and the prohibition of abuse of process entail that the claims before this Tribunal cannot benefit from investment protection under the [BITs] and are, consequently, deemed inadmissible.\"276 Fraud infected every aspect of the investment.277 Given the seriousness of the forgery, the Tribunal found no need to delve into the estoppel issue. The Committee's conclusion on estoppel also applies to all legal theories based on the same facts, which included good faith.\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 6.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 53-56.\n\nAward, para. 528.\n\nAward, para. 509.\n\n201.\n\nThe Applicants also aver that the Parties implicitly agreed towards the end of the 2015 Hearing that the case would continue on the remaining issues of reliance and good faith, and did not expect that the Tribunal could dispose of the case without hearing the Parties on these important issues.278 The transcripts of the 2015 Hearing mention that Churchill and Planet's counsel, in reaction to the State's proposal to the Tribunal for a partial summary judgment which would clarify and narrow the issues for the next phase,279 declared that if the State \"withdrew their application for a strike-out of the whole claim, things would be much easier because the scope would then be on forgery and authenticity of these documents, and we would move on and brief the legal consequences of that within a fuller factual context at a merits hearing.\"280 The necessity of dialogue and cooperation in international arbitration between the parties and the tribunal cannot be the pretext for curtailing the freedom of the tribunal to organize the proceedings. Here, it is difficult to analyse these exchanges as a joint proposal for the future of the process, and less a binding agreement between the Parties on procedure that the Tribunal subsequently violated.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 60-62.\n\nExhibit A-34, [O'Donoghue] [202:23] to [203:4].\n\nExhibit A-34, [Sheppard] [203:22] to [204:2].\n\n202.\n\nThe Applicants contended at the Hearing on Annulment that the Tribunal breached due process by making a decision on inadmissibility without previously informing the parties that international public policy and the principle of good faith were to be addressed and by introducing an argument that favoured one side without hearing the evidence and arguments from all the parties.281 Without any regard to the distinctive grounds of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the first complaint which is made here under Article 52(1)(d) is indistinctly made under the ground of Article 52(1)(b) and will be examined below. The second ground is an affirmation unsupported by evidence and fails.\n\nSee para. 121 above.\n\n203.\n\nAs the Applicants point out with some relevance, demonstration of the denial of their right to be heard does not require, however, that they would have won or even that the exclusion of further evidence under the *Minnotte* framework was decisive for the outcome of the Award.282 In their view, the Tribunal did not reject the three-step inquiry which Churchill and Planet had propounded in their submission of September 23, 2016 on *Minnotte*.283 According to the Applicants, the first element (whether there was wrongdoing by a third party) had already been addressed in prior pleadings,284 but the second element (whether that third-party wrongdoing was connected to the investor's claims, the nature of this connection and the extent to which it impacts upon the investor's good faith) were considered by the Tribunal in examining the seriousness of the forgeries and fraud and Churchill and Planet's alleged lack of diligence.285\n\nReply, paras. 58-68.\n\nAward, para. 503.\n\nExhibit A-42, paras. 4 and 5.\n\nReply, para. 50.\n\n204.\n\nThere is no need for the Committee to second guess the final issue that the Parties have debated, namely whether *Minnotte*, which was one among the twenty investment cases on which the Tribunal relied in charting the legal framework addressing the consequences of unlawful conduct by a claimant or its business associate,286 was or was not dispositive in its decision. As discussed above, where there has been a grave violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, including denial of a reasonably full opportunity to be heard, the injury is inherent in the due process violation, without the need to demonstrate that the outcome of the case would have been different otherwise. Here, however, the Committee has found no such violation.\n\nAward, paras. 488-506.\n\n**ii. Whether Mr. Noor's evidence was re-admitted and given weight**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nAs the Applicants present the issue, there were only two possible explanations for Mr. Noor's signing the Exploitation Licenses in 2009: he was either duped into doing so, in the belief that the earlier foundational survey and exploration licenses were valid, or he was complicit in the underlying scheme. In his witness statement of September 23, 2014, Mr. Noor explained the circumstances in which, soon after taking over as Regent of East Kutai, he signed several decrees granting mining rights to companies of the Ridlamata Group:\n\nI assumed that all the steps of the regular process had been duly taken by the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau and I therefore signed such decrees and those other documents on 27 March 2009. However, later (around early September 2009), it was discovered that their applications were based on forged documents, i.e, based on forged mining undertaking licenses for exploration. If I had been informed of such matters, I would not have signed the mining undertaking licenses for exploitation and those other documents on 27 March 2009.287\n\nExhibit A-4, paras. 10 and 11.\n\n206.\n\nAt the 2015 Hearing, the Tribunal excluded the evidence of Mr. Noor on Churchill and Planet's motion.288 The Award recapitulates Indonesia's arguments that included reference to Mr. Noor's deception289 and further concludes on the seriousness of the forgeries and fraud:\n\nThe facts suggest that the motive driving the fraud was to extend Ridlatama's mining rights in the EKCP [\u2026] To this end, forged licenses and related documents were fabricated to give an impression of lawful entitlement. That false impression was then used to obtain hand-signed Exploitation Licenses issued on the misguided assumption that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights.290\n\nExhibit A-28, [Sheppard] [10:24] to [11:25]; Exhibit A-29, [Sheppard] [2:23] to [6:5] and [Kaufmann-Kohler] [8:19] to [9:11].\n\nAward, para. 165.\n\nAward, para. 512.\n\n207.\n\nIn the Applicants' view, this reference to a \"misguided assumption\" necessarily equates to the effective readmission of Mr. Noor's witness statement into evidence, without prior notice to or consultation with the Parties. Further, the Applicants contend that they could only have rebutted the presumption thus created in the Tribunal's mind about Mr. Noor's state of mind by cross-examining him, which they were unable to do. The Committee is unable to agree with the Applicants' first argument, however, which makes the second one unnecessary to address.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of the facts led to its conclusion in the Award that the survey licenses procured by the Ridlatama Companies were not authentic,291 and that the same conclusion had to be made regarding the exploration licenses as well as the ancillary documents issued at three levels of the Indonesian Government: the Regency of East Kutai, the Province of East Kalimantan and the Central Government in Jakarta.292 However unable the Tribunal was to make a finding of corruption,293 it found that the facts revealed the existence of a large-scale fraudulent scheme intentionally implemented to obtain coal mining concessions areas in the EKCP exploited by Nusantara. The Tribunal remarked that Ridlatama sent copies of the forged licenses to affected governmental departments for the express purpose to \"ensure that our licenses were officially recognized at all governmental levels,\" thus building a *\"facade\"* or providing a \"mantle\" of legitimacy to an illegal enterprise.294 Even if this was not Churchill and Planet's stated aim, it nevertheless remains that Mr. Benjamin, the Director of PT ICD, also sent the forged documents to various agencies of the Indonesian Government.295 Other passages in the Award relate to the building of this facade: \"Ridlatama, not the Regency, circulated the disputed licenses and related documentation to governmental agencies allegedly to ensure that they received all relevant documentation in case the Regency failed to provide it.\"296\n\nAward, paras. 353 and 359.\n\nAward, paras. 365, 382, 408, and 426.\n\nAward, para. 466.\n\nAward, paras. 510, 511, and 426.\n\nExhibit A-26(1), para. 94.\n\nAward, para. 472.\n\n209.\n\nIn the context of these findings, the Committee considers that the Tribunal could well have reached its view in paragraph 512 of the Award, as to the \"misguided assumption\" of valid mining rights, simply by virtue of the conduct of Ridlatama, which the Tribunal evidently considered to have been patently *aimed* at creating that very assumption. Given the breadth of the Ridlatama scheme, these actions do not appear to have been aimed solely at Mr. Noor, and therefore his personal state of mind (*i.e.*, whether dupe or co-conspirator) was not essential to the Tribunal's conclusion that any grant of mining rights necessarily would flow from the deceit practiced by Ridlamata. The Committee thus does not share the Applicants' conclusions that the only way the Tribunal could have reached this view would be by resorting to Mr. Noor's witness statement. Accordingly, there is no need to address the Applicants' arguments about an alleged lack of prior notice to or consultation with the Parties regarding the alleged readmission of that statement.\n\n210.\n\nThe Applicants further assert that the Tribunal's handling of Mr. Noor's evidence, constituted unequal treatment, in light of the Tribunal's decision to accept Indonesia's privilege objection with respect to the Police Files on the forgery issue, which it refused to produce. The Applicants argued at the Hearing on Annulment that the decision on the secrecy of the Police Files taken in the Award was unexpected, unfair and in breach of their right to be heard as the Tribunal earlier had rejected Indonesia's objection based on the confidentiality of those documents, when ruling on document production requests.297 The Committee does not see the two issues as comparable, however, and therefore no question of equal treatment arises in connection with Mr. Noor's witness statement.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [66:18] to [67:23].\n\n211.\n\nWith respect to the Police Files, the Committee recognizes that the obligation of the parties to cooperate with each other and with the tribunal in the production of evidence is a general principle of international arbitration. The duty to disclose evidence is however not absolute, and national law concerns, such as the secrecy of criminal investigations relied on by Indonesia, can be put forward to limit full adversarial proceedings.298 Indeed, the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration299 place the issue of State secrecy squarely within the tribunal's discretion in weighing objections to document requests.300 The Tribunal was thus well within its discretion in first ordering production of the Police Files, and later in apparently accepting the State's stated impediment to complying. In ultimately accepting the Respondent's claim of privilege in relation to the Police Files, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not unduly limit Churchill and Planet's right to present their case. Nor did it breach the procedural equality of the Parties, on the Police Files issue alone or in asserted comparison with its handling of the excluded Mr. Noor's witness statement. Accordingly, no departure from a fundamental procedural rule has been demonstrated on this basis.\n\nAward, para. 251.\n\nExhibit A-3.\n\nIBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, 2010, Article 9(2)(f).\n\n**iii. The burden of proof in relation to fraud and deception and to the** ***Minnotte*** **factors**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nOn September 24, 2014, Indonesia filed a Forgery Dismissal Application asking the Tribunal for a hearing within three weeks to address the authenticity of 34 disputed documents relating to licenses and permits for the EKCP as well as an award dismissing Churchill and Planet's claims as inadmissible by reason of their invalidity and illegality.301 The Tribunal placed on the State the burden of proving its allegations of fraud and forgery:\n\nIt is a well-established rule in international law that each party bears the burden of proving the facts which it alleges (*actori incumbit onus probandi*). Since the Respondent alleges that the Survey and Exploration Licenses and related documents are forged and that the Exploitation licenses were obtained through deception, the Respondent bears the burden of proving its allegations of forgery and deception.302\n\nExhibit A-5.\n\nAward, para. 238.\n\n213.\n\nThe Applicants contend that notwithstanding the Tribunal's stated allocation of the burden of proof, in reality the Tribunal placed the burden on them to disprove deceit after the exclusion of Mr. Noor's witness statement. The Applicants point to the following passage of paragraph 522 of the Award: \"the Claimants did not seek to ascertain the means of signing mining licenses in Indonesia [\u2026] although that information would have been readily available.\" This, they aver, cannot square with the oral testimony of the Regent, Mr. Ishak, that anything can happen inside the Regency.303 The Applicants further contend that the Tribunal's conclusion in paragraph 512 of the Award, that a \"false impression\" of lawful entitlement created by the forgeries and fraud \"was then used to obtain hand-signed Exploitation Licenses issued on the misguided assumption that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights,\" can only be explained by a reversal of the burden to proof. In their view, the impossibility of proving that Indonesia was complicit without cross-examining Mr. Noor aggravated the unfairness of their situation.304 The Applicants further allege that, although the Award does not state which Party bore the burden of proving the *Minnotte* factors, it should have been incumbent on Indonesia, and not on them, to bring evidence of what a reasonable investor would have done in the same circumstances. Instead, they claim that the Tribunal made them bear the burden of proving the benchmark against which their own conduct was to be tested, which according to paragraph 504 of the Award was \"whether the Claimants were put on notice by evidence of fraud that a reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector should have investigated, and whether or not they took the appropriate corrective steps.\"\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 126, fn. 185.\n\nReply, para. 103.\n\n214.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Continental Casualty v. Argentina* recognized that:\n\nthe ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules contain no provisions with respect to the burden of proof or standard of proof. Accordingly, there cannot be any requirement that a tribunal expressly apply a particular burden of proof or standard of proof in determining the dispute before it. Indeed, the tribunal is not obliged expressly to articulate any specific burden of proof or standard of proof and to analyse the evidence in those terms, as opposed simply to making findings of fact on the basis of the evidence before it.305\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 135 (ALA-20).\n\n215.\n\nThe Committee admits, as an accepted principle of international law regarding the allocation of the burden of proof between the parties, that each party has the onus of proving the facts relied on in support of its case.306 But it is equally well accepted that placing the initial onus on a party presenting an application does not obviate the requirement, once it adduces proof of the facts on which its claims are based, that the opposing party present proof to the contrary, supporting its denial of the claim. In this case, it is entirely consistent with these shifting burdens of proof that Indonesia was required to prove forgery, yet the Tribunal thereafter may have looked to Churchill and Planet to demonstrate why the multiple forgeries thus demonstrated should not impact the admissibility of their case. Churchill and Planet introduced evidence of their supposed due diligence, but the Tribunal evidently found this evidence insufficient to surmount the inadmissibility challenge. In so finding, the Tribunal considered the evidence that both Parties contributed, and whether they had discharged their respective burdens of proof.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, para. 215 (ALA-11).\n\n216.\n\nParagraph 522 of the Award, to which the Applicants object, discusses and evaluates the evidence of Churchill and Planet's witnesses: \"Mr Quinlivan stated that '[w]e didn't know how Bupati [i.e. the Regent] or various people fit their signature to various documents', although that information would have been readily available. Indeed, Messrs. Benjamin and Gunter testified that they would have been very concerned had they known that the licenses were not hand signed by Mr. Ishak, which shows that they knew that mining licenses were hand-signed.\" While the Applicants may disagree with the Tribunal's evaluation of this evidence, the task certainly was within the Tribunal's discretion. Similarly, the Tribunal exercised its discretion in assessing the evidence regarding the due care of Churchill and Planet in the licensing upgrade process.307 Tribunals have broad discretion in the weighing of evidence, although that discretion certainly must be exercised within the limits of good faith, impartiality and equality of the parties which mark the proper exercise of the function of judging.\n\nAward, paras. 516-527.\n\n217.\n\nThe Applicants also rely on paragraph 512 of the Award (which reads in pertinent part that \"forged licenses [\u2026] were fabricated to give an impression of lawful entitlement. That false impression was then used to obtain hand-signed Exploitation Licenses issued on the misguided assumption that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights\") to argue that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof with regard to deception, placing on them the onus of disproving that Mr. Noor was labouring under a \"false impression\" when he hand-signed the Exploitation Licenses.308 However, as the Committee observed above, the reference in this passage to forgeries having been \"*used to*\" obtain licenses issued on a \"misguided assumption\" equally may be explained as referring to Ridlatama's evident *intention and purpose* of creating such a false impression of legality. Nothing in this phrase mandates a conclusion that Churchill and Planet were expected to prove anything with respect to Mr. Noor's personal state of mind. Rather, it appears that the Tribunal ultimately felt it unnecessary, given the massive scope of the fabrications and the purpose to which their dissemination was put - which called into play international law doctrines of admissibility of claims - to determine whether (and if so, at what level) some State official(s) may have been complicit in the scheme.\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\n218.\n\nThe Committee finds that this approach does not reflect an alteration of the normal balance in the proving of facts by the Parties to the detriment of the Applicants. Nor have they substantiated their suggestion that the Tribunal's treatment of Mr. Noor's evidence calls into question its underlying impartiality.309 It is true that the Tribunal found that someone within the Regency most likely had assisted in the process of introducing the fabricated documents into the databases and archives, thereby contributing to create an appearance of legitimacy to the fraudulent scheme. At the same time, the Tribunal also found that nothing in the record supported Churchill's \"Bad Faith Authorization Theory,\"310 which speculated that Indonesian officials may have intentionally accepted documents they knew to be forged as part of a scheme to reap the benefits of foreign investment while preserving an ability to repudiate the licenses if that later proved convenient. These two findings are not inconsistent, and the Tribunal was within its power to make both findings based on the record before it, without thereby \"reversing\" any burdens of proof.\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\nAward, paras. 459 and 476.\n\n219.\n\nThe Applicants also question the Tribunal's decision not to draw an adverse influence of complicity from the non-appearance of Mr. Noor. The State explained at the 2015 Hearing that Mr. Noor was now a private citizen residing in Australia, over whom the Government had no control. Indonesia declared that it had informed Mr. Noor about the 2015 Hearing and believed until the last moment that he would be attending, when he communicated that, because of travelling engagements, he could not participate.311 The Tribunal obviously could not have foreseen the later press report after the Award, citing Mr. Noor's statement that \"[w]e won an arbitration dispute in an international tribunal. This is proof of our sovereignty over the management of Indonesia's natural resources,\"312 and therefore could not have considered this in evaluating Indonesia's contention at the time that neither it nor the Tribunal could compel him to attend the 2015 Hearing.\n\nExhibit A-29, pp. 1, 2, 6 and 7.\n\nExhibit A-46.\n\n220.\n\nIn any event, whatever the Tribunal may have felt about Indonesia's explanation for Mr. Noor's absence, it evidently considered the circumstances sufficient to strike his witness statement, but insufficient to support the further relief of an adverse inference about his complicity in the underlying illegality, in the absence of other evidence to that effect. This was within its discretion to conclude: while adverse inferences are tools available for tribunals to deter parties from refusing to comply with their orders about the production of evidence, nothing requires that a tribunal grant such inferences. Moreover, the Tribunal evidently considered it unnecessary to apply the sanction of adverse inferences, when, as noted above, it was able to base its finding that the forgeries and fraud created an environment of apparent legality on evidence other than Mr. Noor's.\n\n221.\n\nFinally, the Applicants cannot demonstrate annullable error on the basis of the Tribunal's failure to draw adverse inferences in response to Indonesia's non-production of the police report into the alleged forgeries. The Tribunal weighed these reasons.313 As discussed above, tribunals have discretion to draw adverse inferences when a party declines to produce certain evidence, but they have no obligation to do so. In the Committee's view, it was not unreasonable for the Tribunal to find that drawing an adverse influence was not the appropriate solution in response to Indonesia's stated constraints based on the secrecy of criminal investigations.\n\nAward, para. 250.\n\n**iv. The Infection Issue**\n---------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Applicants describe the Infection Issue as one of two questions (the other being the issue of their reasonable reliance on Ridlatama) as to which there remained procedural uncertainty after the 2015 Hearing, because of the Tribunal's failure to define the scope of the \"legal consequences\" of a finding of forgery that the Tribunal had directed be addressed in the document authenticity phase.314 The Respondent contends that the Applicants have waived any argument that they were denied the right to be heard on the Infection Issue because they had every opportunity to present evidence on Indonesian law on that issue.315 As the State points out,316 the Parties discussed the validity of the Exploitation Licenses on the occasion of the reconsideration of PO13.317 However, the Applicants' grievance is essentially that the proceedings of the document authenticity phase developed after PO13, which was affirmed by PO15, in a manner that ruled out any possibility of addressing the Infection Issue before the Award, despite their having stressed their perceived importance of the issue at the end of the 2015 Hearing.318 Moreover, Churchill and Planet did object to PO13 in the underlying proceedings.319 In these circumstances, they cannot be deemed to have waived the possibility to challenge the Award on Article 52(1)(d) grounds, with respect to PO13 or other procedural steps taken thereafter in the ensuing proceedings.320\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 57.\n\nRejoinder, para. 99.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 120.\n\nExhibit A-12, pp. 10 and 11; Exhibit A-13, pp. 13-16.\n\n\"That would be a major, major issue, not something that's addressed in post-hearing briefs after an authenticity hearing\" (Exhibit A-34, [Sheppard] [213:18] to [213:20]). See Annulment Application, para. 115.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 120.\n\nExhibit A-12, pp. 12-14.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal indicated that PO20, paragraph 5, confirmed PO15, paragraph 34, and PO13, paragraph 28321 on the scope of the authenticity phase and of the Award. The Applicants interpret PO20, which, at paragraph 5, clarified that the term \"legal consequences\" of a finding of forgery \"does not cover the effect of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses on the exploitation licenses,\"322 as an indication that the Infection Issue was reserved for subsequent consideration.323 In both their post-hearing briefs, Churchill and Planet, in answering PO20 question e) (\"[s]ubject to paragraph 5 above, in the event that the signatures on (i) the survey and exploration licences [\u2026] are not handwritten or not authorized, what would be the legal consequences on each Party's case?\"), declared that the State had not explained why, as a matter of Indonesian law, it was necessary to have valid survey and exploration licenses to obtain valid exploitation licenses.324 The Applicants reiterated in their first submission of September 23, 2016 on *Minnotte* that the Tribunal still had not heard evidence on Indonesian law as to how the Exploitation Licenses had been infected by the invalidity of the underlying survey and exploration licenses.325\n\nAward, para. 232.\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 5.\n\nAnnulment Application, paras. 57 and 66-68.\n\nExhibit A-36(1), paras. 57-59; Exhibit A-38, para. 26.\n\nExhibit A-42, para. 6; Tr. Day 1 [Luttrell] [162:23] to [163:19].\n\n224.\n\nEven if, as alleged by Churchill and Planet, the President of the Tribunal agreed with them about the Infection Issue at the 2015 Hearing that \"these are delicate issues and we're very much aware of this,\"326 the Tribunal thereafter decided in the Award that its inadmissibility conclusion:\n\nis within the scope of the present arbitration as it was circumscribed in Procedural Orders Nos. 13, 15 and 20. In this context, the Tribunal notes in particular that it arrived at this outcome without there being a need to address the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian law.327\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [211:14] to [211:15].\n\nAward, para. 530.\n\n225.\n\nThe Committee does not accept the Applicants' contention that the inadmissibility conclusion is the result of a confluence of annullable errors, including denial of the right to be heard, on the Infection Issue.328 Because there was no violation of due process on the *Minnotte* factors, the Committee concludes that, even if Churchill and Planet were unable, as they declare, to present evidence before the Award on Indonesian law regarding the Infection Issue - and even if they expected to be able to do so in a subsequent phase of the proceedings - this alleged violation is immaterial. The Tribunal did not decide the substance of the Infection Issue; rather, it held that the issue was irrelevant given the Tribunal's overarching finding about inadmissibility of the claims under international law. Specifically, the Tribunal explained that \"[t]he accumulation of forgeries both before the and after the Exploitation Licenses show that, *irrespective of their lawfulness under local law*, the entire EKCP was fraudulent, thereby triggering the inadmissibility of the claims under international law.\"329 As the Tribunal thus decided the case on grounds for which evidence of Indonesian law was not needed, there could be no violation of the right to be heard by its not first allowing submissions on the subject it deemed unnecessary to its decision.\n\nReply, para. 115.\n\nAward, para. 530 (emphasis added).\n\n**v. Denial of justice**\n------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe same conclusion applies to the Applicants' complaint that they were never given a chance to brief the question of whether they suffered a denial of justice in the hands of the Indonesian judicial system, which they characterize as simply dismissed *in limine*.330 The Tribunal decided that it could dispense with ruling on this claim, because like Churchill and Planet's other claims, it was tainted as a consequence of the fraudulent nature of the EKCP to which it related.331 Given the Tribunal's findings about the inadmissibility of the claim under international law, it was not obliged to allow further briefing on the substance of the claim. Moreover, the Committee concludes that it was within the Tribunal's discretion to approach the inadmissibility issue on a global basis, addressing *all* of the Claimants' claims together (which it viewed as each predicated on the same fraudulent investment project) rather than re-opening briefing to see if the Claimants' could differentiate their denial of justice claim from the others that could not survive a finding of forgery. The Claimants did not have a fundamental right to brief admissibility of the denial of justice claim separately, and the Tribunal accordingly did not violate such a right.\n\nReply, para. 124.\n\nAward, para. 531.\n\n**vi. State responsibility**\n----------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Applicants allege that if they had been given the opportunity to present their case on State responsibility, they could have marshalled further evidence to demonstrate the full scale of the State's involvement in the fraudulent scheme found by the Tribunal. Indonesia argues that the Applicants have waived any objection because, during the proceedings, they did not complain that they were being denied the opportunity to adduce evidence regarding Indonesia's involvement in the fraud.332 The Committee disagrees. Nothing in the Award (or in the record) indicates that Churchill and Planet have unequivocally waived their right to attack the Award on this count.\n\nRejoinder, para. 96.\n\n228.\n\nAt the same time, the record does not support the Applicants' contention that they were precluded from submitting such evidence on this issue as they might have wished. While the original scoping of the document authenticity phase was undoubtedly focused on the issue of forgery, it did not affirmatively restrict either party from presenting evidence on comparative responsibility for whatever forgeries might be demonstrated, or from directly arguing that particular additional fact-finding was needed to establish State complicity. The Tribunal held in the Award that there was insufficient evidence before it in support of Churchill and Planet's Bad Faith Authorization Theory or of a finding of corruption.333 Regarding the issue of complicity short of corruption or \"bad faith authorization,\" the Tribunal found only that an insider must have assisted to introduce into Regency databases and archives the forgeries and fraud that were orchestrated by authors outside the Regency, most likely Ridlatama.334 These findings were made after an evidentiary phase in which Churchill and Planet were alive to the potential consequences of proving broader complicity, as they contended in their post-hearing brief of October 20, 2015, that the State would be responsible for the criminal wrongdoing of its officials.335 With respect to those post-hearing briefs, the Tribunal had authorized the Parties in paragraph 3 of PO20 to append new documents \"with prior leave of the Tribunal. Nothing precluded the Applicants from seeking such an opportunity to present further evidence on complicity, or from presenting further arguments on State responsibility at that time.\n\nAward, paras. 458 and 466.\n\nAward, paras. 476.\n\nExhibit A-36(1), fn. 16.\n\n229.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the document authenticity phase was not managed in violation of Churchill and Planet's right to be heard, and the Applicants have not proven that they were deprived of an opportunity to present their case on State responsibility. Moreover, because the Tribunal considered Ridlatama the principal actor in the fraud, and evidently did not consider the possible assistance of a Regency insider of sufficient magnitude to excuse the taint over the whole investment, it was not required to work through a systematic analysis of international law of State responsibility, or invite a supplementary round of pleadings focused on that issue. While the Applicants now contend that they could have developed other arguments on the preclusive effects of State responsibility on the Respondent's admissibility objection that would have impacted the outcome of the Award, they cannot set the clocks back to the time before the Award. Certainly, after the Award, it is too late to develop arguments that could have - perhaps -influenced the Tribunal's decision. The right to be heard in arbitration proceedings does not extend to challenging an Award on the basis of arguments that were not made, but that could have been made, before the Tribunal.\n\n**B. Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe Applicants argue that, without Mr. Noor's evidence about his state of mind when signing the Exploitation Licenses, the Infection Issue shifted from a factual question on whether he was defrauded in doing so, to a purely legal question of Indonesian law, namely whether the Exploitation Licenses perfected previous flaws in the licensing chain.336 They note that the Tribunal however did not apply Indonesian law to this issue. The Applicants also object that the Tribunal did not apply the law of State responsibility to consider whether alleged complicity by State officials should bar the Respondent from asserting admissibility objections, and did not consider whether illegalities likely attributable to a third party (Ridlatama) rather to the Claimants could bar them from proceeding with their unjust enrichment claim, seeking return of the USD 70 million invested in EKCP. The Applicants conclude that in each of these says, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers to decide the dispute in accordance with the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, which the Tribunal determined in general to be the BITs, Indonesian law and international law.337\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 75.\n\nAward, paras. 234-236.\n\n231.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which is one of the provisions in Section 3 relating to the powers and functions of the tribunal, requires the tribunal:\n\nto decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\nThe discretion accorded to tribunals under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention when determining the applicable rules of law does not square with an extensive power of *ad hoc* committees to check the determination, application and content of the law applied by the tribunals. This has been recognized, with a few exceptions,338 by *ad hoc* committees.339\n\nDecisions on Annulment in *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), June 29, 2010 (Exhibit RLA-ANN-331) and *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), July 30, 2010 (Exhibit RLA-ANN-287).\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016 (RLA-ANN-277).\n\n232.\n\nAs noted above, the Award decides that:\n\ninadmissibility applies to all the claims raised in this arbitration, because the entire EKCP project is an illegal enterprise affected by multiple forgeries and all claims relate to the EKCP. This is further supported by the Claimants' lack of diligence in carrying out their investment.340\n\nAward, para. 529.\n\n233.\n\nThe Award consequently did not decide the Infection Issue (\"without there being a need to address the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian law\"),341 nor the Claimant's \"substitute claims\" (including unjust enrichment),342 because, finding the entire investment to be fatally tainted by use of forgery, it considered all claims relating to that investment to be inadmissible as a matter of international law.343 This is not a failure to *apply* Indonesian law after having first found it to be applicable to a particular issue, but rather a decision that Indonesian law *was not applicable* in this context, given the Tribunal's view of an overarching international law principle. The same is true for the Applicants' alternative argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it still should have examined Indonesian law to determine whether there was a lacuna or conflict between local and international law. Under the guise of an argument based on a manifest excess of powers, this criticism seeks to challenge the Tribunal's core decision on applicable law, which is not reviewable by the Committee according to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nAward, para. 530.\n\nExhibits A-06, p. 3; A-10, p. 3; A-12, p. 10; A-14, pp. 14-16; A-26(1), paras. 219-221; A-38, para. 27.\n\nAward, para. 531.\n\n234.\n\nWith respect to the issue of State responsibility, the Applicants contend that had the Tribunal applied Article 7 of the ILC Articles or decided to reserve its decision on State responsibility, their claims would have survived, because assistance of a State official in Ridlatama's scheme would be attributable to the State, and would have barred it from succeeding on an inadmissibility objection predicated on the investment's illegality. The Applicants assert in addition that if one or more State officials had facilitated the fraud and forgery, then the *Minnotte* analysis could not have resulted in dismissal, because the State could not rely on inadequate due diligence by the Claimants to support an admissibility objection in circumstances of its own complicity. According to the Applicants, the Tribunal therefore should have addressed and applied the international law on State responsibility, before reaching its ultimate decision on admissibility.\n\n235.\n\nThe Committee is not insensitive to the question of whether, and to what extent, the widespread scheme of forgery might have involved the support of one or more State officials. However, it was for the Tribunal, and not the Committee, to determine the relevance of this issue. The Tribunal concluded that the widescale use of forgeries to obtain EKCP licenses rendered any claims for interference with the EKCP investment inadmissible, as a fundamental matter of international law. Although the Tribunal did not expressly discuss in this context the implications of its finding about the involvement of a Regency insider, evidently the Tribunal did not consider that finding sufficient for it to ignore the sweeping illegalities on which it found the entire EKCP investment to have been based. In this sense the Tribunal appears to have implicitly considered issues of comparative responsibility and rejected the Applicants' arguments in this regard. The Committee views the Applicants' insistence that the Tribunal nevertheless should have addressed the State responsibility arguments expressly rather than by implication, as essentially a challenge to the Tribunal's approach to admissibility. This is not within the Committee's remit to entertain. A finding of inadmissibility is not a manifest excess of powers, and based on the Tribunal's approach to inadmissibility, there was no requirement that it go further to expressly apply doctrines of State responsibility or Article 7 of the ILC Articles.\n\n236.\n\nThe same answer must be made to the Applicants' further contention that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by not addressing their argument in the arbitration that illegality may operate as a defence to unjust enrichment only where the illegal act was done by the party that brings the unjust enrichment claim, and not by an associated party. While it is true that the Tribunal made no finding of fraud or forgery on the part of Churchill and Planet themselves, it also found that \"the seriousness, sophistication and scope of the scheme are such that the fraud taints the entirety of the Claimants' investment in EKCP,\"344 and that since \"all claims relate to the EKCP,\" the Claimants accordingly could not avail themselves of the BITs to pursue any claims related to \"the entire EKCP,\" which it deemed \"an illegal enterprise affected by multiple forgeries.\"345 This finding was made in application of what the Tribunal found to be the proper law. Under the cloak of an argument based on the violation of the manifest excess of powers, the Applicants more generally seek here an impermissible challenge to the decision made by the Tribunal.\n\nAward, para. 528.\n\nAward, para. 529.\n\n237.\n\nUnder the same head of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, Churchill and Planet at the Hearing on Annulment further criticized the Tribunal for exceeding the scope of the task it fixed with its own orders.346 According to the Applicants, the Tribunal made a finding on inadmissibility which was outside the scope of the document authenticity phase, excluded all issues of factual inquiry going to other legal issues such as estoppel, as well as submissions on the Infection Issue, but nevertheless based its decision on inadmissibility on facts revolving around the *Minnotte* question,347 and relied on principles of good faith and international law as a basis for finding the claims inadmissible, without first making clear that such issues had been included in the scoping of the phase pursuant to PO15 and PO20, or considering the impact of the President's statement at the end of the 2015 Hearing that international law was excluded from the scope of the post-hearing briefs.348\n\nTr. Day 2 [Weeramantry] [10:22] to [11:2].\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [42:5] to [42:8] and [45:13] to [46:22].\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [40:8] to [41:7].\n\n238.\n\nAs discussed above, PO15 noted that the facts in support of the Claimants' estoppel arguments overlapped with the facts of their expropriation and fair and equitable treatment claims, but that overlapping facts were not meant to be part of the bifurcated issues. PO15 also clarified PO13 with regard to the scope of the authenticity phase, as including \"legal submissions on the positions in law in a scenario where there would be forgery (including for instance the legal requirements for estoppel as opposed to the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel).\"349 PO20 then restated that \"the Parties are to address the matters falling within the scope of PO15 especially paragraph 34.\"350 The Applicants also remark that submissions on estoppel and on \"infection\" as a matter of international law were deemed outside the authenticity phase,351 pursuant to the intervention of the President at the end of the 2015 Hearing: \"[n]ot on the international law parts at this stage.\"352 The impact of this statement is however to be counterbalanced by the clear statement in PO20 that \"[t]he present directions come in lieu of any different comments made by the Tribunal at the [h]earing.\"353 As a result, the Infection Issue under Indonesian law, which was considered still to be part of the authenticity phase at the end of the 2015 Hearing, was added to the list of excluded issues by PO20.\n\nExhibit A-16, para. 34.\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 5.\n\nTr. Day 2 [Sheppard] [20:18] to [20:22].\n\nExhibit A-34, [Kaufmann-Kohler] [218:4] to [218:5].\n\nExhibit A-35, para. 5.\n\n239.\n\nThe notion of \"excess of powers\" is a reprimand of an exercise of powers by an organ beyond the limits of its constituent instrument. In the circumstances of this arbitration, the powers of the Tribunal flow from the combination of the arbitration clause in the BITs and the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. International arbitrators also possess inherent powers for conducting the arbitration through procedural orders and directions, as recognized by the ICSID Convention. The ICSID Convention includes in Section 3, on the powers and functions of the tribunal, an Article 44 which directs the tribunal to decide any question of procedure not covered by the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules or the agreement of the parties. The silence of fundamental texts on matters of procedure accounts for the flexibility of these issues before arbitral tribunals and for the necessity to give them considerable leeway in this regard, as the ICSID Convention does. In a like fashion to determinations of the applicable law, there is a heavy threshold for demonstrating a manifest excess of powers with respect to the determination, interpretation and application of procedural rules by the tribunal. The *ad hoc* Committees in *Wena* or *Repsol v. Petroecuador* explained that a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention must be self-evident rather than the result of elaborate interpretation.354 The Applicants have precisely been trying to demonstrate at great length that the expression \"legal consequences\" was not understood by the Parties and had to be explained by the Tribunal 21 months after it first appeared in PO13.355 Their dissatisfaction with the interpretative exercise of the Tribunal in PO15 and PO20 does not amount to a manifest excess of powers.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 35 (RLA-ANN-288); *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10), Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2007, para. 36 (RLA-ANN-296).\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 52.\n\n240.\n\nFinally, the Applicants raised at the Hearing on Annulment that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by introducing a legal framework with the *Minnotte* direction whose factual foundation had not been part of the hearing before the Tribunal in 2015. As discussed above in the context of Article 52(1)(d), however, Churchill and Planet already had presented substantial evidence and argument on issues of due diligence and due care, both prior to making those investments and during the course of their operation. In these circumstances, the Applicants have failed to demonstrate that the Tribunal's consideration of the legal implications of the evidence thus presented - after first alerting the Parties to the *Minnotte* case and inviting their further submissions on the legal issues thus presented - constituted a failure in the conduct of the proceedings beyond the Tribunal's authority and amounting to a manifest excess of powers.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Mr. Noor's evidence**\n--------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for the readmission of Mr. Noor's witness statement, or was inconsistent as to whether it had disregarded Mr. Noor's evidence. The Committee has already decided, contrary to the Applicants' allegation, that the Tribunal did not use Mr. Noor's evidence, so no failure to state reasons arises, either in the sense of a contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning, or in the sense of a failure to explain its reasons, for a non-existent procedural step.\n\n**ii. The Infection Issue**\n---------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Committee refers to the following passage of the decision on annulment of the *Wena ad hoc* committee:\n\n81. Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The Tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms in the decision. [...]\n\n83. It is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on the merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal's decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirements as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the *ad hoc* Committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal's conclusions can be explained by the *ad hoc* Committee itself.356\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 81 and 83 (RLA-ANN-288).\n\n243.\n\nThe Applicants say that the Infection Issue was dismissed on the basis of international law without explanations as to why international law trumped Indonesian law. There is no need for a Tribunal to provide reasons on issues which have become irrelevant to the outcome of the case. The Tribunal agreed with the State that \"claims arising from rights based on fraud or forgery which a claimant deliberately or unreasonably ignores are inadmissible as a matter of public international public policy.\"357 In these circumstances, there was no necessity to address the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian law, because the forgery was too serious:\n\nIndeed, whatever their validity under municipal law, the Exploitation Licenses were embedded in a fraudulent scheme, being surrounded by forgeries. Forged documents preceded and followed them in time with the Re-Enactment Decrees, which under non-authentic signature, purported to revoke the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses. The accumulation of forgeries both before and after the Exploitation Licenses show that, irrespective of their lawfulness under local law, the entire EKCP was fraudulent, thereby triggering the inadmissibility of the claims under international law.358\n\nAward, para. 508.\n\nAward, para. 530.\n\n**iii. Standard of due diligence**\n----------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Tribunal was arbitrary because the *Minnotte* factors were judged in a vacuum, without explaining the reasons as to how it could reach a view as to what was the appropriate standard of diligence for \"a reasonable investor in the Indonesian mining sector\" and as to why the Claiamnts' due diligence failed to meet this standard.359 The Tribunal said that it would assess the standard of willful blindness addressed by *Minnotte* \"by focusing on the level of institutional control and oversight deployed by the Claimants in relation to the licensing process.\"360 It remarked that investment tribunals have held that investors must exercise \"a reasonable level of due diligence, especially when investing in risky business environments.\"361 And it clarified in assessing Churchill and Planet's lack of diligence that an investor aware, as they were, of the risks of investing in a certain environment should be expected to be \"particularly diligent in investigating the circumstances of its investment,\" and added that, because the environment of the Indonesian coal mining industry was risky and because Ridlatama showed no record of proven reliability, as acknowledged by Churchill and Planet,362 an investor should exercise \"a heightened degree of diligence.\" The Tribunal further found that Churchill and Planet's conduct was \"not diligent in ensuring that Nusantara was no longer interested in its mining rights\" and \"failed to exercise due diligence when 'indications of forgery' first came to light in the BKP report of 23 February 2009.\"363 The standard and the findings were thus explained.\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 98; Tr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [72:7] to [72:19].\n\nAward, para. 504.\n\nAward, para. 506.\n\nExhibit A-37, paras. 100-104.\n\nAward, paras. 517, 518, 519, and 523.\n\n**iv. Police Files**\n--------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal first ordered the Respondent in PO16 to produce the Police Files relating to the authenticity of the Ridlatama licenses,364 and then, after the Respondent's request for reconsideration due to the confidentiality of criminal investigations, inviting the Tribunal to refrain from drawing adverse inferences from non-production,365 the Tribunal decided to \"take these matters into consideration if and when relevant to the assessment of the evidence before it, being specified that the Parties may further address these matters in their post-hearing briefs.\"366 Churchill and Planet accordingly asked the Tribunal to draw the inference that the information contained in the Police Files would not have supported the forgery and fraud allegations against Ridlatama.367 The Tribunal arrived at the conclusion in the Award that, on the basis of the evidence on record, it \"does not deem it necessary to draw adverse inferences,\" and added that \"it accepts the invocation of privilege by the Respondent in relation to the [P]olice [F]iles concerning investigations into the alleged forgery.\"368 As already noted, the reasonableness of adverse inferences depends on the discretion of the tribunal. In light of the consensus of national laws, including Indonesian law, on the confidential nature of criminal inquiries, the Tribunal acknowledged the difficulty to produce the Police Files. There was no need to provide reasons for an assertion which in itself was a sufficient reason.\n\nExhibit A-19(2), Annex A, DPR n\u00b0 11.\n\nExhibits A-20 and A-23.\n\nExhibit A-25.\n\nExhibit A-36(1), paras. 26 and 27.\n\nAward, paras. 249 and 250.\n\n246.\n\nThis addresses the Applicants' criticism that the Tribunal did not provide reasons in the Award for its decision to reconsider the earlier ruling on document production.369 The Applicants further criticize the Tribunal for not having explained in its letter of May 12, 2015370 why it deferred its decision at the time, rather than ruling on the request for reconsideration as and when made. The Applicants do not explain, however, how this had consequences for the alleged lack of reasoning of the Award. This criticism is not within the mandate of the Committee, which is to assess alleged defects in the reasoning of an award and not in the quality of earlier procedural documents.\n\nExhibit A-19(1).\n\nExhibit A-25.\n\n**v. State responsibility**\n---------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Applicants contend that their arguments on State responsibility were based on the general principle of good faith that no one can benefit from its own wrongdoing, but that the Tribunal did not rule on the matter, dismissing the claim on admissibility grounds without addressing the potential implications of apparent involvement by a Regency insider.371 The efficiency of annulment proceedings requires that whenever an award is allegedly affected by defects which fall under several grounds under Article 52, the applicant has the obligation to demonstrate, other than by force of consequence, that it has a valid complaint under each separate ground. Each head of annulment raises different issues which must be addressed separately.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Luttrell] [175:5] to [175:10].\n\n248.\n\nThe Applicants raised an argument according to which, under international law, if a State participates in the wrongdoing, it cannot rely on its wrongdoing for admissibility purposes. The Tribunal did find it likely that there was some \"insider\" within the Regency who provided \"assistance\" to the illegal scheme, in the terms below:\n\nthe Tribunal is of the view that the forgeries and the fraud were orchestrated by author(s) outside of the Regency, most likely Ridlatama, who benefited from the assistance of an insider to introduce the fabricated documents into the Regency's databases and archives. While the record points towards Ridlatama rather than the Claimants in relation to the forgery of the contentious documents, the Tribunal does not need to make a definitive finding to draw the proper legal consequences as the analysis below will show. It suffices for present purposes that, on the basis of the record, there is no conceivable author than Ridlatama. [...] The author of the forgeries and fraud is not positively identified (although indications in the record all point to Ridlatama possibly with the assistance of a Regency insider).372\n\nAward, paras. 476 and 528.\n\n249.\n\nImplicit in the Tribunal's use of the singular to describe the \"insider,\" and to its description of his role as \"possibly [providing] *assistance*,\" is that the Tribunal did not consider it likely that multiple State officials were involved, nor that the single individual likely involved was the principal driver of the illegal scheme. To the contrary, the Tribunal expressly described the scheme as having been \"*orchestrated*\" by \"author(s) outside of the Regency, most likely Ridlatama.\" The Tribunal's language thus telegraphed fairly clearly its view of the comparative responsibility of Ridlatama and the individual Regency insider. This context informs the Committee's impression that the Tribunal evidently did not consider the role of the insider to be sufficient to overcome the stark admissibility implications of a sweeping illegal scheme, orchestrated by Ridlatama and tainting the entire EKCP investment on which the Claimants predicated their claims. While the Tribunal did not go through the exercise of an express State responsibility analysis, its views on the matter (to borrow a phrase from the *Wena* committee) were \"implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award,\" which \"can reasonably be inferred from the terms in the decision.\"373\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 81 and 83 (RLA-ANN-288).\n\n**vi. IP claim, denial of justice and substitute claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Applicants submit that, even if some of their licenses were unauthorized, certain claims would survive, not only because of issues of estoppel and acquiescence, but also because those particular claims (*i.e.,* for unjust enrichment, denial of justice and interference with intellectual property) allegedly were independent of the forged licenses.374 The Applicants argue that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons as to why their alternative claims could not proceed and to explain the nexus between the *Minnotte* factors and each of their alternative claims.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Sheppard] [9:3] to [9:12] and [74:6] to [74:25]; Exhibit A-26(1), paras. 206-221.\n\n251.\n\nIn PO12, which bifurcated the proceedings between a liability phase dealing with all liability and authenticity issues and a quantum phase, the Tribunal acknowledged that:\n\nWhile it is true that the document authenticity issue may go to the heart of the question whether the revocation of the mining licenses was wrongful, other claims regarding, for instance, the alleged denial of justice before Indonesian courts would *prima facie* survive.375\n\nExhibit A-8, para. 47.\n\n252.\n\nThereafter, however, the Tribunal reconsidered PO12, following the Respondent's detailed submission contending that all claims should be dismissed if it were established that the relevant documents were forged. The Tribunal determined in PO13 that the document authenticity issue be dealt with as a preliminary matter in a separate phase. In PO15, which reaffirmed PO13, the Tribunal stated that it was:\n\nalso mindful of the Claimants' argument that their allegedly surviving claims are intertwined with the forgery allegations. At this stage of the proceedings, it appears correct that for instance the facts in support of estoppel overlap with the facts of the expropriation and fair and equitable treatment claims. However, these overlapping facts are not meant to be part of the bifurcated issues.376\n\nExhibit A-16, para. 34.\n\n253.\n\nHowever, as a consequence of the document authenticity phase, the magnitude of the fraud demonstrated was such that the Award ultimately concluded as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that, in light of the declaration of inadmissibility of all claims, it can dispense with ruling on the Claimants' alleged substitute causes of action. Such causes of action exclusively relate to the Claimants' investments in the EKCP. Since the latter are tainted by the fraud, so are the substitute claims by force of consequence.377\n\nAward, para. 531.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal is entitled to be terse in its reasoning. It is commonly accepted by *ad hoc* committees that tribunals may state their reasons succinctly or at length and that Article 52(1)(e) allows arbitrators a discretion as to the way they express their reasoning.378 The *Wena ad hoc* committee noted that the ICSID Convention does not prescribe the manner in which the reasons are to be expressed as long as the parties may understand the tribunal's reasoning.379 The Applicants expected a link to be shown between the Tribunal's inquiry in the document authenticity phase and the dismissal of their unjust enrichment, intellectual property and denial of justice claims. The Committee finds that there is a reasonable connection invoked by the Tribunal (however briefly) in the above cited paragraph of the Award, between the conclusions reached about the fraudulent nature of the EKCP and the dismissal of these claims (along with all others linked to the EKCP) on grounds inadmissibility.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID dated May 5, 2016 (RLA-ANN-277).\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 75-83 (RLA-ANN-288).\n\n**vii. International public policy**\n------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nFinally, at the Hearing on Annulment, the Applicants also argued that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for the finding in paragraph 508 of the Award, namely that international public policy was engaged on the facts it found.\n\n256.\n\nParagraph 508 reads:\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that claims arising from rights based on fraud or forgery which a claimant deliberately or unreasonably ignored are inadmissible as a matter of public policy. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants' contention that they conducted \"extensive\" or \"exhaustive\" due diligence in verifying the authenticity of the disputed mining licenses, both when the licenses were purportedly issued and when forgery allegations were first brought to their attention.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal explained through paragraphs 509-527 of the Award the seriousness of the forgeries and fraud and explained the reasons for its findings about Churchill and Planet's lack of diligence. The Committee considers that the reasoning is clear and self-explanatory. It bears recalling that the paragraphs of an award must be read together with the award as a whole.380 True, Indonesia referred in its comments on *Minnotte* to a universally recognized principle that no party should be allowed to benefit from its own wrongful conduct,381 but the Applicants focus on one sentence of paragraph 508 considered in isolation. Their challenge is centred on the non-essential expression \"matter of public policy,\" for the Tribunal's core finding on the consequences of fraud and forgery, together with a lack of diligence in connection with such fraud and forgery, for the admissibility of claims. Put in the context of paragraphs 489-500 of the Award, which analyse arbitral jurisprudence on corruption and fraud, the only reasonable meaning of paragraph 508 of the Award is that claims based on rights obtained though fraud are inadmissible as a matter of international public policy and that such violation is compounded by Churchill and Planet's lack of diligence as further exposed at paragraph 516 of the Award. Contrary to the Applicants' affirmations, the Tribunal did not say that the *Minnotte* factors were part of international public policy and had no reasons to give on an issue which is not part of its reasoning. The Tribunal had also no obligation to answer how Churchill and Planet's conduct amounted to deliberately or unreasonably ignoring fraud to ground its reasoning. The Applicants' arguments fail.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 261 (ALA-20).\n\nExhibit A-43, para. 41.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Applicants and the Respondent each request that the Committee order the other party to pay all of the costs of the annulment proceedings with interest.382 As agreed at the Hearing on Annulment, the Parties filed their statements of costs on August 31, 2018. The Applicants quantified their costs at USD 771,360 (including the amounts paid to ICSID as advance on costs for these proceedings namely USD 500,000). The Respondent quantified its costs at USD 1,851,140.23 (including the fees and expenses for its counsel, its legal expert Prof. Ida Nurlinda, and the supporting Government's team).\n\nAnnulment Application, para. 220(c) (the Applicants fail to quantify the applicable interest rate); CounterMemorial, para. 258, and Rejoinder, para. 122 (the Respondent asks for \"interest at a commercial reasonable rate\").\n\n259.\n\nThe costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Committee as well as ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to USD 397,536.09:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Committee's fees and expenses: | USD 301,786.09 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 74,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses383 | USD 21,750.00 |\n| **Total** | **USD 397,536.09** |\n\nThis amount includes actual charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision (printing, copying and courier).\n\n260.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicants pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).\n\n261.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides, in its relevant part, that:\n\nthe Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\n\n262.\n\nUnder this provision, applicable to these annulment proceedings by virtue of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has broad discretion in allocating the costs of the proceedings and the Parties' legal costs and expenses.\n\n263.\n\nThe Committee takes note of Section 65 of the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, which notes a recent trend towards requiring an unsuccessful annulment applicant to bear the costs of the proceedings (*i.e.,* the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the institution fees). The Committee recalls that it reserved its decision on the allocation of costs relating to the Stay Request, the Termination Application and Security Request to the conclusion of the annulment proceedings. The Committee notes that the Applicants acted in the proceedings in a constructive manner; however, the arguments they presented in support of their Annulment Application were rejected. The Committee decides, in light of the outcome of these proceedings, that the Applicants will bear the costs of these proceedings, which they have thus far advanced *in toto*.384\n\nThe Centre will reimburse the Applicants any remaining balance in the case account once all costs and expenses have been paid.\n\n264.\n\nIn relation to the Parties' respective claims for reimbursement of legal fees and expenses, however, the Committee declines to issue a cost order against the Applicants, leaving each Party to bear its own \"party costs,\" even though the Annulment Application has been unsuccessful. The Applicants' concerns were not frivolous and were presented efficiently and in good faith.\n\n265.\n\nThe Committee would like to record its appreciation to the Parties' representatives and counsel on both sides which greatly assisted it.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n266.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the *ad hoc* Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Annulment Application is dismissed in its entirety;\n\n(2) Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 54(3), the Stay of Enforcement of the Award is terminated;\n\n(3) The Applicants shall bear the costs of the proceedings; and\n\n(4) Each Party shall bear its own party costs incurred in connection with these annulment proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application to Terminate the Stay", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2019-03-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Application to Terminate the Stay\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining PTY Limited (\"Churchill\" and \"Planet,\" together, the \"Applicants\") filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application for annulment (the \"Annulment Application\") and request for stay of enforcement in respect to the award rendered on December 6, 2016 in *Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40) (the \"Award\"). The Annulment Application was filed pursuant to Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"Convention\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n2.\n\nOn April 11, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment Application and notified to the Applicants and the Republic of Indonesia (the \"Respondent\" or the \"State\") (together with the Applicants, the \"Parties\") that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n3.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\") was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Convention. Its members are: Judge Dominique Hascher (French), serving as President, Professor Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel (German) and Ms. Jean Kalicki (U.S.). All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.\n\n4.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to confer and agree upon a briefing schedule to address the Applicants' request for stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n5.\n\nBy communications of May 24, 26 and 27, 2017, the Parties transmitted to the Committee an agreed briefing schedule, which included one round of written submissions and oral arguments at the first session of the Committee.\n\n6.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, the Applicants filed their application for continued stay of enforcement of the Award along with exhibit A-47 and legal authorities ALA-23 through ALA-29 (the \"Stay Request\").\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of May 31, 2017, the Committee took note of the Parties' agreement on the briefing schedule and decided to hold the first session on June 20, 2017 by telephone conference. In light of the agreed timetable, the Committee also invited the Parties to confirm that they agreed to extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award and the 30-day time limit set forth in Arbitration Rule 54(2) until the date of the first session.\n\n8.\n\nBy emails of June 1 and 5, 2017, the Parties confirmed that they agreed to extend the provisional stay of enforcement and the time limit for the decision on the Stay Request until June 20, 2017.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Stay Request along with exhibits R-269 through R-282, legal authorities RLA-272 through RLA-276, and selected exhibits from the arbitration proceeding.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 13, 2017, the Respondent submitted an amended version of its observations on the Stay Request.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the Committee held the first session. The Parties and the Members of the Committee discussed draft Procedural Order No. 1. The Parties presented oral pleadings on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, which were recorded.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, having deliberated by telephone call, the Committee ruled that the stay of enforcement was to continue until it issued a final determination on the matter.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 27, 2017, the Committee issued a Decision on the Applicants' request for continued stay of enforcement of the Award (the \"Stay Decision\") by which it decided that the stay on enforcement of the Award would continue pending a decision on the Annulment Application, subject to the condition that the Applicants use their best efforts to pledge a property located in the East Kalimantan Province (Indonesia) (the \"Port Land\").\n\n14.\n\nBy email of July 11, 2017, the Applicants provided an update on the actions taken to pledge the Port Land and submitted a copy of the Churchill Board's resolution approving the pledging of the Port Land as security for the purpose described in the Stay Decision.\n\n15.\n\nOn July 14, 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 providing *inter alia* directions on the subsequent conduct of the annulment proceeding and setting forth the procedural calendar of the proceeding.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Committee informed the Parties that the hearing on annulment would take place in Singapore, proposing possible hearing dates.\n\n17.\n\nBy email of July 23, 2017, the Applicants provided a further update on the execution of the pledge and requested the Respondent to indicate its preferred time and place for executing the pledge through a power of attorney to sell and transfer the Port Land (the \"POA\").\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of July 24, 2017, the Respondent requested that the Applicants provide further information on the POA and indicated that, absent adequate responses, it would not be able to consider that the POA could produce effects under Indonesian law.\n\n19.\n\nBy email of July 25, 2017, the Applicants responded to the Respondent's letter of July 24, 2017, and attached documents concerning the purchase of a parcel of the land comprising the Port Land. On the same date, the Applicants indicated that they transmitted to the Respondent (via an online sharing platform) the files containing the transaction documents for each parcel comprising the Port Land.\n\n20.\n\nBy email of July 26, 2018, the Respondent informed the Applicants that it intended to respond to their email by July 27, 2018, that it could not access the documents shared via the online platform, and that it was setting up a Sharefile account for the Applicants to upload the documents.\n\n21.\n\nBy email of July 27, 2017, the Applicants informed the Respondent that the documents relating to the Port Land were uploaded to the Sharefile account as requested by the Respondent.\n\n22.\n\nOn the same date, the Applicants filed a witness statement from Mr. David Quinlivan and a copy of a deed poll made under Australian law to execute the POA (the \"Deed Poll\"). The Applicants also requested that the Committee either (i) confirm that the stay of enforcement of the Award remain in place (as the Deed Poll, and the documents attached to it, satisfy the condition set forth at paragraph 42 of the Stay Decision), or (ii) temporarily extend the stay until its decision on the Applicants' request for a ruling on compliance with paragraph 42 of the Stay Decision.\n\n23.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, the Committee invited the Respondent's comments on the Applicants' correspondence by August 2, 2017 and decided that the stay of the enforcement would remain in effect until the Committee reached a final determination on the matter.\n\n24.\n\nBy a letter of July 27, 2017, the Respondent responded to the Applicants' email of July 25, 2017, and submitted Exhibit R-ANN-283.\n\n25.\n\nBy emails of July 28 and 31, 2017, the Parties indicated their availabilities for a hearing on the dates proposed by the Committee.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of July 31, 2017, the Committee proposed to the Parties additional dates for the hearing on annulment.\n\n27.\n\nOn August 2, 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Applicants' correspondence of July 27, 2017, together with exhibits R-ANN-284 to R-ANN-289, R-80, R-86, R-226, and C-257.\n\n28.\n\nOn August 3, 2017, the Committee decided that, for the purpose of the Stay Decision, the Applicants had complied with the condition set forth therein. The Committee also confirmed that the stay on enforcement of the Award would continue pending decision on the Annulment Application.\n\n29.\n\nOn August 3 and 4, 2017, the Parties confirmed their availabilities on the additional hearing dates proposed by the Committee.\n\n30.\n\nOn August 10, 2017, the Committee confirmed that the hearing on annulment would take place on July 16 and 17, 2018.\n\n31.\n\nOn October 20, 2017, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on annulment along with annex A, exhibits R-ANN-290 through R-ANN-311, legal authorities RLA-ANN-277 through RLA-ANN-309 and selected exhibits and legal authorities from the arbitration proceeding.\n\n32.\n\nBy emails of December 22, 2017, the Parties agreed upon a revised procedural calendar, which was approved by the Committee on December 28, 2017.\n\n33.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, the Applicants filed their reply on annulment along with exhibit A-48, annex A to Procedural Order No. 16 from the arbitration proceeding, and legal authorities ALA-30 and ALA-31.\n\n34.\n\nOn April 10, 2018, the Respondent filed its rejoinder on annulment along with exhibits R-ANN-312 through R-ANN-329 and legal authorities RLA-ANN-307, RLA-ANN-310 through RLA-ANN-338.\n\n35.\n\nOn April 13, 2018, the Respondent filed an application to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award and request for security for costs (the \"Termination Application and Security Request\") together with the expert report of Prof. Ida Nurlinda, exhibits R-ANN-330 through R-ANN-353, legal authorities RLA-ANN-339 through RLA-ANN-376, and selected exhibits from the arbitration proceeding.\n\n36.\n\nOn April 23, 2018, the Applicants filed observations on the Termination Application and Security Request (the \"Observations on the Termination Application and Security Request\") together with exhibits A-49 through A-52 and legal authorities ALA-32 through ALA-35.\n\n37.\n\nOn May 7, 2018, the Respondent filed a reply on the Termination Application and Security Request (the \"Reply on the Termination Application and Security Request\") together with exhibits R-ANN-354 and R-ANN-355, and legal authorities RLA-ANN-377 through RLA-ANN-385.\n\n38.\n\nBy emails of May 24, 2018, the Parties advised the Committee of the agreements they were able to reach on the schedule of the hearing and its organization.\n\n39.\n\nOn June 11, 2018, the President of the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n40.\n\nOn June 19, 2018, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 on the organization of the hearing.\n\n41.\n\nThe hearing on annulment (the \"Hearing\") was held at the Maxwell Chambers, in Singapore, on July 16 and 17, 2018.

THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of the Respondent's Position**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Committee order the termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award and that the Applicants post a security for costs in the amount of USD 2 million to an escrow account within 14 days from the Committee's order.1 The Respondent also seeks the reimbursement for all costs and expenses relating to the Termination Application and Security Request plus interest at a commercially reasonable rate.2\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 46(b); see also \u00b6\u00b6 37-45 and Reply on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 46.\n\n*(i) The Application to Terminate the Stay of Enforcement of the Award*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Applicants have no title to the Port Land. The Respondent bases itself on the expert report of Prof. Nurlinda. According to Law No. 5 of 1960 regarding Basic Agrarian Law, which regulates all matters pertaining to land situated in Indonesia, PT Techno Coal Ultama Prima (\"PT TCUP\")3 cannot own land since only physical persons who are Indonesian citizens can have rights of ownership.4 The only rights which a legal person, such as a company, may have are a right to build or a right to use the land (the \"Rights\"), which are more akin to leasehold title than freehold title to land.5 However, PT TCUP never acquired any form of land title to the Port Land because it never applied for, much less obtained, the requisite location permit from the Indonesian Land Office.6 The documents provided by the Applicants on July 24-26, 2017 show that PT TCUP had no Rights over them. Specifically, the documents show that PT TCUP paid villagers, who had no rights of ownership, for relinquishing their rights to cultivate land parcels of the Port Land, which are otherwise State land.7\n\nA subsidiary of PT Indonesian Coal Development (\"PT ICD\"), an Indonesian company acquired by Churchill from Ridlatama.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 24.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 25.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 4, 25 and 26; Reply on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 9.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 27; Reply on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 7.\n\n50.\n\nPT TCUP having no title over the Port Land, it cannot pledge anything to the Respondent.8 Law No. 4 of 1996 regarding Encumbrance Right Over Land and Land-Related Objects governs the creation of security rights over immovable property in Indonesia.9 The Deed Poll made under Australian law by the Applicants as a unilateral pledge of the Port Land could not at any rate establish a security *in rem* or create a privilege available to a holder of a security right under Indonesian law.10 The Applicants have thus not proceeded in good faith in using their \"best efforts\" as mentioned in the Committee's letter of August 3, 2017 to pledge the Port Land in accordance with Indonesian law.11\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 6, 22 and 28.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 28.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 29.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 22.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent further alleges that the Applicants breached their obligation under the Deed Poll not to do anything that might hinder its performance by failing to register the Deed Poll in the Companies House in England as a charge against Churchill (which is registered in London), and by granting on November 22, 2017 a charge over all Churchill's assets to Pala Investments Limited (\"Pala\"), its largest shareholder, giving the latter priority over any rights granted to the Respondent under the Deed Poll and the Award.12 From an English law perspective, the Respondent argues that it is an unsecured creditor, which now ranks behind Pala.13 The Applicants acted in bad faith by prioritizing their third-party litigation funder over the Respondent and leaving the Respondent with nothing to secure the amount of the Award.14\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 30.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 32.\n\nReply on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 14.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Applicants do not have at present the funds to pay the Award and are unlikely to raise the money to pay the debt.15 The principal mechanism used by Churchill to raise funds through loan notes issued to Pala was only designed to thwart the Respondent's access to the money owed to it under the Award.16\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 33.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 34.\n\n*(ii) The Request for Security for Costs*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent asks that the posting and maintenance of the security be a condition to the continuation of the annulment proceeding in order to secure the payment of a possible decision ordering the Applicants to pay the Respondent for the legal fees and costs incurred in the annulment proceeding.17\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 46(b).\n\n54.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, *ad hoc* committees have the inherent power to issue orders to protect the integrity of annulment proceedings, including by ordering the posting of a security for costs. The Respondent states that a security for costs is warranted in the present circumstances because the Applicants are insolvent, which gives rise to a serious risk that they will not pay any costs award issued in the annulment proceeding.18 Furthermore, the posting of a security would not impede the Applicants' ability to pursue this proceeding because they can raise funds through their wealthy shareholders (who are said to be behaving like third party funders, taking a gamble on the present proceeding with the freedom to withdraw whenever they please).19\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 41.\n\nTermination Application and Security Request \u00b6 42.\n\n**B. Summary of the Applicants' Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Respondent's application to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award and the request for security of costs are devoid of merit and the Committee should dismiss them.20 The Applicants reserve their right to claim the costs of preparing their Observations on the Termination Application and Security Request.21\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 17.\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 25.\n\n*(i) The Application to Terminate the Stay of Enforcement of the Award*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Termination Application is only an attempt to relitigate the Stay Decision and the Committee's subsequent ruling of August 3, 2017, although nothing has changed.22 Specifically, the Applicants argue that the Respondent's position has not changed since it has unsuccessfully opposed the Applicants' request for a stay,23 and that the Indonesian law issues raised in the Termination Application were already examined and rejected by the Committee in its previous rulings.24\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 2.\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 6.\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 3, and 7 to 9.\n\n57.\n\nFurthermore, the Applicants deny that they have misrepresented their interest in the Port Land and state that the agreements entered into by PT TCUP in respect of the Port Land confirm that PT TCUP owns the land.25\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 10.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, the Applicants deny that Churchill granted a charge over its assets to Pala giving it priority over the Respondent and argue that the security offered to the Respondent in the Deed Poll is senior to the security given to Pala.26\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 11-16.\n\n*(ii) The Request for Security for Costs*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the late timing of the Respondent's request for security for costs betrays its strategic rationale of attempting to drain the Applicants of resources before the Hearing.27\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 18.\n\n60.\n\nRelying on *Commerce Group v. El Salvador* and *Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v. Russian Federation*, the Applicants argue that *ad hoc* committees can grant security for costs only in \"extreme and exceptional circumstances\" when abuse of process or bad faith is involved.28 In the present case, there are no exceptional circumstances justifying a security for costs as the Applicants have neither acted in bad faith, nor has there been a change in circumstances since the commencement of the annulment proceeding. In particular, the Applicants note that their finances have not deteriorated during the annulment proceeding and the Deed Poll remains enforceable in accordance with its terms.29\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6\u00b6 19 to 21.\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 21.\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicants contend that it is a well-established principle in ICSID caselaw that, in order for a security to be granted, the requesting party must demonstrate that the security is both necessary and urgent.30 According to the Applicants, the Respondent's request fails to meet both tests as it is not urgent (as demonstrated by the fact that the Respondent filed it at a late stage of the proceeding), nor is it necessary.31 In any case, the Respondent's request for security is inadmissible as it pertains to a hypothetical right and the Committee could not decide on it without prejudging the case.32\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 22.\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 22.\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 22.\n\n62.\n\nFinally, in the Applicants' view, due to their financial inability to post the requested security, an order granting the security would stifle their rights under the Convention and their access to justice, bringing an end to this proceeding.33\n\nObservations on the Termination Application and Security Request \u00b6 23.\n\n**III. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. The Application to Terminate the Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the Convention stipulates that the \"Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision.\"\n\n64.\n\nPursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(3), \"if a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or the Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application\n\n65.\n\nArbitration Rule 54(4) provides that a request pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(3) \"shall specify the circumstances that require the... modification or the termination\" of the stay, and that a \"request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\"\n\n66.\n\nThe Application was deferred until April 13, 2018 and was not accompanied by any protestation of urgency. In light of the decision on the Application for Annulment that will be issued on the same date as the present Decision, the Respondent's application to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award is moot.\n\n**B. The Request for Security for Costs**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nArticle 44 of the Convention provides that:\n\n[a]ny arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\n\n68.\n\nArticle 47 of the Convention states that:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n69.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(4) of the Convention, the \"provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\"\n\n70.\n\nAs noted above, the stated grounds for the Respondent's request for security for costs is to ensure its ability to recover any legal fees or costs that the Committee might order the Applicants to reimburse, as part of its Decision on the Application for Annulment. As the Committee however has decided not to award reimbursement of party costs, the Respondent's request for security for costs is now moot.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n71.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee decides that the Respondent's application to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award and request for security for costs are moot.\n\n72.\n\nThe decision on the costs relating to the Respondent's application to terminate the stay of enforcement of the Award and request for security for costs are reserved for the Decision on the Application for Annulment."}]}
