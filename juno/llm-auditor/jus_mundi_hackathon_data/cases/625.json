RELEVANT FACTS REGARDING JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe factual background of this arbitration is being summarized hereunder to the extent necessary to rule on the jurisdictional issues arising out of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n**(i) The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn Bhd, a company incorporated under the laws of Malaysia.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is a marine salvage company.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant is represented by Mr. Hal C. Eren and Mr. Bruno A. Ristau of the Eren Law Firm, Washington, D.C., U.S.A.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent**\n-----------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is the Government of Malaysia.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent is represented by Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, Dato' Umi Kalthum Bte Abd. Majid, Dato' Mary Lim Thiam Suan, Mr. Kamaludin Bin Md. Said, Mrs. Mahiran Bte Md Isa, Mr. Mohammad Al-Saifi Bin Haji Hashim, Mrs. Chandra Devi a/p Letchumanan, Mr. Md. Taufik Bin Md. Yusoff and Mrs. Aliza Bte Sulaiman, all of the Attorney General's Chambers, Putrajaya, Malaysia. The Respondent is also represented by co-counsel Dato' K.C. Vohrah of Lee Hishamuddin Allen & Gledhill, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Dato' Cecil Abraham (assisted by Mr. Sunil Abraham) of Shearn Delamore, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n**B. The Background Facts**\n---------------------------\n\n**(i) The Contract**\n--------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant entered into a contract dated August 3, 1991 with the Respondent which called for, *inter alia*, the Claimant's location and salvage of the cargo of the \"DIANA,\" a British vessel that sank off the coast of Malacca in 1817 (the \" **Contract** \").\n\n8.\n\nUnder the Contract, the Claimant was required, among other things, to utilize its expertise, labour and equipment to carry out the salvage operation, and to invest and expend its own financial and other resources, and assume all risks of the salvage operation, financial and otherwise. The Claimant was also obligated, among other things, to clean, restore and catalogue the recovered items. Under a later contract, the Claimant was obligated to (and did) arrange for the auction of the recovered items in Europe by the international auction firm, Christie's.\n\n9.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant was to:\n\na. provide the salvage vessel, crew and equipment;\n\nb. utilise its expertise and skills;\n\nc. finance the salvage operation in its entirety;\n\nd. search for, locate and secure the wreck on the sea floor;\n\ne. bring the cargo to the surface;\n\nf. clean, restore, inventorise and photograph the salvaged items;\n\ng. provide for the safe keeping of the salvaged items;\n\nh. provide for adequate insurance; and\n\ni. arrange for the sale of the salvaged porcelain and other valuable items.\n\n10.\n\nThe Contract was on a \"no finds-no pay\" basis, which is a well established practice in marine salvage and, meant that all the costs of the search and salvage operation (and its attendant risks) would be borne exclusively by the Claimant. It also meant that the Claimant would recover its expenditure and make a profit only if both the salvage operation and the subsequent sale of the recovered items were successful.\n\n11.\n\nThe Contract provided for the Respondent to receive the sale proceeds of the recovered items, and thereafter to disburse to the Claimant the portion of the sale proceeds belonging and due to the Claimant. If the appraised sum of the unsold artefacts and auction value of recovered items sold came to less than US$10 million (\" **the Aggregate** \"), the Claimant was entitled to 70% of the proceeds. If the Aggregate came to between US$10 million and US$20 million, the Claimant's share would be 60% of the proceeds. If the Aggregate exceeded US$20 million, the Claimant would receive 50% of the proceeds. The Respondent also reserved to itself the right to withdraw salvaged items from sale, provided that the Claimant was paid its share of the best attainable value for such items.\n\n12.\n\nAlthough not provided for under the Contract, the Claimant claimed that the Respondent assumed oversight of all aspects of the Claimant's performance under the contract through a committee (the \" **Salvage Committee** \"). The Salvage Committee comprised a fluctuating number of about 20 often-changing representatives from the Malaysian Marine Police, the Marine Department, the National Museum, the National Archives, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and the Ministry of Transport. According to the Claimant, the Salvage Committee took all decisions on behalf of the Respondent in connection with the Contract. While not disputing these facts, the Respondent contends that nothing turns on this.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant's survey and salvage efforts took almost four years, and the recoverable cargo numbered 24,000 pieces in all. Items which were not withheld from sale were auctioned in March 1995 in Amsterdam by Christie's for approximately US$2.98 million.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant claims that, under the Contract, it was entitled to 70% of the amount realized at the auction. The Claimant alleges that it was only paid U$1.2 million (or 40% of the amount realised from the sale at Christie's). The Claimant further alleges that the Respondent withheld from sale salvaged items of Chinese origin valued at over US$400,000 and did not pay the Claimant its share of the best attainable value of such items.\n\n**(ii) The Arbitration and Court Proceedings in Malaysia**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent in July 1995. Clause 32.1 of the Contract provides that:\n\nAny dispute arising under this Contract shall be settled by Arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Laws of Malaysia. The venue of the arbitration shall be Kuala Lumpur.\n\n16.\n\nThe arbitrator1 who was appointed to hear the dispute between the Parties issued an award (\"the Award\")2 dismissing the Claimant's claim. The Claimant's efforts to challenge the Award in the Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration and in the Malaysian High Court failed. The Claimant alleged that, in these proceedings, the Judge hearing the case, Justice Dato' Abdul Azmel bin Haji Ma'amor, dismissed the Claimant's petition to challenge the Award without reviewing or even looking at the Claimant's petition. The Claimant has argued that it was denied fundamental and rudimentary due process in the Malaysian courts.\n\nThe arbitrator, Mr. Richard Talalla, was appointed by the Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre of Arbitration (\"KLRCA\") after a Consent Order was made on May 27, 1996, by the High Court of Malaysia granting the right of appointment to the KLRCA. The dispute reached the High Court after the Claimant made an application in that Court to compel the Respondent to answer its Request for Arbitration.\n\nThe hearing before Mr. Richard Tallala took 21 days. Award at 3.\n\n**(iii) The Review of the Malaysian Arbitration Award by the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant then applied to the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators for an internal review of the Award in December 2000. The Claimant alleges that it was denied an opportunity to be heard on this matter before its application was dismissed by the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators in January 2001.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\" **ICSID** \" or \"the **Centre** \") received a Request for Arbitration from the Claimant against the Respondent dated September 30, 2004. The Request invoked the ICSID arbitration provisions in the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Malaysia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which came into force on October 21, 1988 (the \" **Treaty** \" or \" **BIT** \").\n\n19.\n\nOn the same day, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\" **Institution Rules** \"), acknowledged receipt of the request, and transmitted copies to the Government of Malaysia and to the Embassy of Malaysia in Washington, D.C.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated November 1, 2004, the Centre requested further information from the Claimant with regard to:\n\na) the investment of MHS (for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the Malaysia/UK BIT);\n\nb) the classification of the investment as envisaged in Article 1(b)(ii) of the BIT; and\n\nc) the dispute between the parties and, in particular, what violation of the Malaysia/UK BIT was alleged.\n\nThe Claimant filed a response on November 30, 2004.\n\n21.\n\nThe Centre, by letter dated December 30, 2004, inquired of the Claimant whether there had been any attempt to reach agreement on the dispute through pursuit of local remedies as envisaged by Article 7(1) of the BIT, and the response of the Claimant was contained in a letter dated January 26, 2005, advising that it had done so by:\n\n(a) lodging a complaint with the British High Commissioner and the Minister of Special Functions in the Malaysian Prime Minister's Office; and (b) writing to the Malaysian Prime Minister's Office, various Malaysian ministries, the Malaysian International Chamber of Commerce, the Malaysian Bar Council as well as the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated February 18, 2005, the Claimant was again invited by the Centre to address the issue of the classification of the investment as envisaged in Article 1(b)(ii) of the BIT as an \"approved project,\" especially in view of the tribunal's award in *Philippe Gruslin v Malaysia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/3) (\" *Gruslin* \"). The Claimant's response was by letter dated March 4, 2005. The Claimant sought to distinguish *Gruslin* on the facts and the law. The Claimant argued that the claimant in *Gruslin* did not enter into a contract with the Government of Malaysia, whereas the present Contract was entered into between the Claimant and the Government of Malaysia itself. The Claimant pointed out that the Contract was subject to the Malaysian Government's supervision. The Claimant also contended that its performance under the Contract was never stopped by the Respondent, nor did the Respondent refuse to accept the benefits of the Contract as evidence that the Contract was an \"approved project.\"\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated April 13, 2005, the Centre invited the Claimant to address the issue of whether there was a specific process in Malaysia for ministries to designate specific projects as \"approved projects\" as envisaged by Article 1(1)(b)(ii) of the BIT. The Claimant replied by a letter dated April 18, 2005 with reference to the terms of the Contract. The Claimant relied on Clause 1.5 of the Contract, which provides that:\n\nThe term \"Government\"... shall mean... the Secretary General, Ministry of Finance, the Secretary General, Ministry of Transport, the Secretary General, Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Director General of Museums, and the Director of Marine, Peninsular Malaysia or their authorised representatives.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant argued that the Respondent's entry into the Contract and the acceptance of the various benefits of the investment:\n\na) indicated a clear demonstration of the express approval by the Malaysian Government and its ministries of the project in which the Claimant had invested; and b) clearly constituted the requisite classification of the project as an \"approved project\" in accordance with the Respondent's legislation and administrative practice.\n\nThe Claimant also argued that the Respondent was barred by the principle of estoppel from relying on the lack of ministerial classification of the Contract as an \"approved project.\"\n\n25.\n\nThe Request, as supplemented by the Claimant's letters dated November 30, 2004, March 4, 2005 and April 18, 2005, was registered by the Centre on June 14, 2005, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 6(1)(a), notified the Parties of the registration, and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible, pursuant to Institution Rule 7.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nFollowing the registration of the Request for Arbitration by the Centre, the Claimant, in a letter dated June 24, 2005, proposed that the Arbitral Tribunal be comprised of a Sole Arbitrator to be agreed upon by the Claimant and the Government of Malaysia, and that the case be heard in Washington, D.C. The Respondent, in a letter dated July 26, 2005, agreed to the proposal of a Sole Arbitrator, but counter-proposed that the arbitration be heard in Bangkok, Thailand. In their subsequent exchange of correspondence, the Parties ultimately agreed on the method of appointment of the sole arbitrator (namely, by the Secretary-General of ICSID) and further agreed that the issue of the venue of the proceeding would be left to be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of October 4, 2005, the Centre notified the parties that the Secretary-General intended to appoint Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a national of Singapore, as the Sole Arbitrator. The Respondent and the Claimant, by their letters dated October 10, 2005 and October 24, 2005 respectively, expressed agreement with the proposed appointment.\n\n28.\n\nMr. Hwang was appointed by the Secretary-General as Sole Arbitrator and, having accepted his appointment in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 5(3), the Centre, by letter dated November 1, 2005, informed the Parties of the constitution of the Tribunal and that the proceedings were deemed to have commenced on that day, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1). The Parties were also informed of the appointment of Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Senior Counsel, ICSID, as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Written and Oral Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThere was an extensive exchange of communications between the Parties (through the Centre) over the issue of the venue and date of the first session. On December 7, 2005, the Claimant filed a \"Request for Ruling and Order to Compel,\" inviting the Tribunal to rule that the first session should be held at The Hague within the time period required under ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1). The Tribunal's decision was communicated to the parties in a letter from its Secretary, dated December 7, 2005, and further communications were exchanged by the Parties, culminating in a conclusion on December 24, 2005 that the session would take place in The Hague, Netherlands, on December 29, 2005.\n\n30.\n\nOn December 23, 2005, the Respondent filed an objection (\"the Notice of Objection\") to the jurisdiction of the Centre over the dispute, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41, and the proceedings on the merits were thereby suspended, in accordance with Rule 41(3). By letter dated December 25, 2005, the Claimant expressed opposition to the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction.\n\n31.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held on December 29, 2005, at the Hotel Le Meridien Des Indes, The Hague, Netherlands. Present at the meeting were:\n\n1) the Sole Arbitrator, Mr. Michael Hwang, S.C.;\n\n2) the Secretary of the Tribunal, Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu;\n\n3) representatives of the Claimant, Mr. Hal C. Eren of the Eren Law Firm, and Mr. Dorian Ball, a Director of the Claimant; and\n\n4) representatives of the Respondent, the Honourable Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, Attorney General, Malaysia, and Mr. Kamaludin Bin Md. Said.\n\n32.\n\nAt that meeting, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3), a schedule was agreed for the written and oral proceedings on the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction. Other procedural issues identified in a provisional agenda circulated by the Tribunal's Secretary in advance of the hearing were also discussed and agreed. In addition, the Parties granted full authority to the Centre to publish (on its website) all the pleadings and their supporting documents to be filed in these proceedings, as well as decisions of the Tribunal, including its Award. The Respondent reserved its right to redact its submissions for purposes of deleting sensitive information before publication by the Centre. All the conclusions at the session were reflected in the summary minutes of the session, signed by the Sole Arbitrator and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and provided to the Parties together with CD-Roms of the audio recording of the session.\n\n33.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Parties simultaneously filed their Memorials on Jurisdiction by the deadline of March 16, 2006, and their Reply Memorials by the April 17, 2006 deadline. The submissions were each filed in hard copy and in electronic format. The electronic submissions were subsequently posted on the Centre's website.\n\n34.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the hearing on jurisdiction was held on May 25, 2006, at the premises of the German Institute of Arbitration, in Frankfurt, Germany. The following persons were present at the hearing on jurisdiction, namely:\n\n1) the Sole Arbitrator, Mr. Michael Hwang, S.C.;\n\n2) the Secretary of the Tribunal, Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu;\n\n3) the legal representatives of the Claimant, Mr. Hal C. Eren and Mr. Bruno Ristau, together with Mr. Dorian Ball, a Director of the Claimant; and\n\n4) the legal representatives of the Respondent, the Honourable Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail, Attorney General of Malaysia, and his colleagues Mrs. Aliza Bte Sulaiman and Mrs. Chandra Devi a/p Letchumanan together with co-counsel Dato' K.C. Vohrah, Dato' Cecil Abraham and Mr. Sunil Abraham.\n\n35.\n\nVerbatim transcripts were made of the hearing and provided to the Parties together with CD-Roms of the audio recording of the hearing. On May 26, 2006, the Tribunal directed both Parties to exchange post-hearing submissions. The post-hearing submissions were exchanged and filed with the Centre on June 26, 2006.\n\n36.\n\nSubsequent to the post-hearing submissions, there were some gratuitous submissions made by both Parties, which the Tribunal has not found helpful in its deliberations.\n\n37.\n\nFurther, by letters of November 21 and 28, 2006 and March 14, 2007 respectively, the Tribunal requested the Parties to file further submissions on certain aspects of various ICSID awards identified by the Tribunal. (See Paragraphs 49-53 below).\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its performance under the Contract falls within the meaning of \"investment\" under Articles 1 (a) (iii) and (v) of the Malaysia/UK BIT which provide as follows:\n\nArticle 1 **Definition**\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement\n\n(1) (a) \"investment\" means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n\u2026\n\n(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract, having a financial value;\n\n\u2026\n\n(v) business concessions conferred by the law or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Contract also falls within the meaning of an \"approved project\" under Article 1(b)(ii) of the Malaysia/UK BIT because the Contract was entered into directly with the Government of Malaysia itself.\n\n(b) The said term [i.e. investment] shall refer:\n\n\u2026\n\n(ii) in respect of investments in the territory of Malaysia, to all investments made in projects classified by the appropriate Ministry of Malaysia in accordance with its legislation and administrative practice as an \"approved project.\"\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Respondent has violated Articles 2 (Protection of Investment), Article 4 (Expropriation), Article 5 (Repatriation of Investment) and (to the extent that the Respondent has refused to submit to arbitration at ISCID) Article 7 of the Malaysia/UK BIT.3\n\nExtracts from Articles 2, 4, 5 and 7 of the Malaysia/UK BIT are found in a separate Appendix hereto\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent's Notice of Objection objects to jurisdiction over the dispute under the ICSID Convention on the following grounds.\n\n41.1 The alleged dispute between the parties does not concern an \"investment\" as defined in the Malaysia/UK BIT.\n\n41.2 The alleged dispute does not concern an \"approved project\" within the meaning of the Malaysia/UK BIT.\n\n41.3 The subject matter of the alleged dispute (*i*. *e*. *,* the Contract) is purely contractual.\n\n41.4 The dispute arising from the Contract has already been settled by reference to arbitration pursuant to a Malaysian High Court Consent Order dated May 27, 1996. The arbitration led to an Award dated July 2, 1998. The Award was challenged by the Claimant in the High Court of Malaysia on the grounds of alleged misconduct by the Arbitrator under S. 24 of the Malaysian Arbitration Act 1952. The challenge was dismissed on February 4, 1999. The Claimant then filed a complaint concerning the alleged misconduct of the Arbitrator to the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators in London in December 2000. The application was heard by a Disciplinary Tribunal established by the Professional Conduct Committee of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and the complaint was dismissed in January 2001.\n\n**IV. DISCUSSION**\n------------------\n\n**A. Threshold Issue**\n----------------------\n\n42.\n\nAlthough the Respondent has raised a number of jurisdictional objections, any one of these objections, if upheld, would be sufficient to deny the Claimant's relief. The Tribunal therefore turns to consider the first jurisdictional question raised by the Respondent, namely\n\n*Whether there is an* \" *investment* \" *within the meaning of that term as found in the Malaysia-UK BIT as well as in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention*.\n\n**B. Preliminary Remarks**\n--------------------------\n\n43.\n\nFor jurisdiction to be established, the Claimant must show that the Contract falls within the definition of \"investment\" as found under Article 25(1) of the ISCID Convention (\" **Article 25(1)** \"), as well as the definition of \"investment\" as contained in the BIT. This two-stage approach is recognized in the ICISD jurisprudence4 cited by the Parties in this case.\n\n*See* *Salini Costruttori S*. *p*. *A*. *and Italstrade S*. *p*. *A*. *v Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, July 23, 2001, 42 ILM 609 (2003); *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11.\n\n44.\n\nProfessor Christoph Schreuer in his book *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2001) (\" *Schreuer* \") notes that it would not be realistic to attempt a definition of \"investment\" but he identifies the following as features of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention:\n\nBut it seems possible to identify certain features that are typical to most of the operations in question: the first such feature is that the projects have a certain duration. Even though some break down at an early stage, the expectation of a longer term relationship is clearly there. The second feature is a certain regularity of profit and return. A one-time lump sum agreement, while not impossible, would be untypical. Even where no profits are ever made, the expectation of return is present. The third feature is the assumption of risk usually by both sides. Risk is in part a function of duration and expectation of profit. The fourth typical feature is that the commitment is substantial. This aspect was very much on the drafters' mind although it did not find entry into the Convention... The fifth feature is the operation's significance for the host State's development. This is not necessarily characteristic of investments in general. But the wording of the Preamble and the Executive Directors' Report... suggest that development is part of the Convention's object and purpose. **These features should not necessarily be understood as** **jurisdictional requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the Convention**.\"5 (emphasis added)\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), at 140.\n\n45.\n\nAs elaborated below (at Paragraph 70 below), this is one of two possible ways ICSID jurisprudence may be taken to have approached the issue of determining whether there is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1).\n\n**C. Claimant's Submissions on the Issue of \"Investment\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant advances the following principal arguments on the issue of \"investment.\"\n\na) The Contract is the quintessence of \"investment\" because the Claimant invested its own funds and other financial resources in the performance of the Contract, and also assumed the risk that the salvage operation would not succeed.\n\nb) The Claimant relies on the definition of \"investment\" found in *Black's Law Dictionary* : \" *the laying out of money or property in business ventures or real estate so that it may produce revenue or gain (or both) in the future*.\"\n\nc) The Claimant also submits that its performance under the Contract giving rise to \" *claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value* \" has all the hallmarks of \"investment\" in previous ICSID cases. The Claimant relies on *Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica, Inc v Jamaica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/74/2) (\" ***Alcoa Minerals*** \") where the ICSID Tribunal recognized that contribution of capital was one type of investment.\n\nd) The Claimant relies on ICSID jurisprudence in *Salini Costruttori S*. *p*. *A*. *and Italstrade S*. *p*. *A*. *v Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), 42 ILM 609 (\" ***Salini*** \"), *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICISD Case No. ARB/03/11) (\" ***Joy Mining*** \") and *Consorzio Groupement L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA v People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08) (\" ***L*****.*****E*****.*****S*****.*****I*****.*****-DIPENTA*** \") and submits that its contributions, commitments and outlays under the Contract fall within the criteria laid down in these three cases.\n\n**D. Respondent's Submissions on the Issue of \"Investment\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent advances the following principal arguments on the issue of \"investment.\"\n\na) The Respondent argues that the Contract is not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1). The Respondent submits that the purpose of the Contract is \" *for the sole purpose of archaeological interest and the study of historical heritage*.\"\n\nb) The Respondent argues that the Claimant's case does not meet the requirements of \"investment\" espoused in the *Salini* case and that the Contract has not contributed to the economic development of Malaysia.\n\n**E. Consideration of the Claimant's and Respondent's Submissions on the Issue of \"Investment\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Cases Relied on by the Parties**\n--------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal now considers the relevant ICSID jurisprudence on the definition of \"investment,\" within the context of the ICSID Convention, as relied upon by the parties. The Claimant relies mainly on *Alcoa Minerals*, *Salini* and *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA*. The Respondent relies mainly on *Joy Mining* as well as *Mihaly International Corporation v Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2) (\" ***Mihaly*** \"), *Jan de Nul N*. *V*. *Dredging International N*. *V*. *v Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13) (\" ***Jan de Nul*** \") and *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13) (\" ***SGS v Pakistan*** \").\n\n**(ii) Additional Cases on \"Investment\"**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nOn November 21, 2006, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide comments on the respective Decisions on Jurisdiction in the following cases (which had not been discussed in their earlier submissions):\n\na) *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A*. *S v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29) (\" ***Bayindir*** \"); and\n\nb) *Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v Slovak Republic* (Case No. ARB/97/4) (\" ***CSOB*** \").\n\n50.\n\nOn November 28, 2006, the Tribunal further requested the Parties to provide comments on the recently issued Decision of the Annulment Committee in the case of *Patrick Mitchell v The Democratic Republic of Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7) (\" ***Patrick Mitchell*** \").\n\n51.\n\nThe Parties responded with their comments on all three cases. The Respondent replied on December 14, 2006 and the Claimant replied on December 17, 2006.\n\n52.\n\nOn March 14, 2007, the Tribunal further requested the Parties to provide comments on the Decision on Jurisdiction in *PSEG Global Inc and Konya Ilgin Elektrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5) (\" ***PSEG*** \").\n\n53.\n\nThe Parties responded with their comments on *PSEG* on March 22, 2007.\n\n**(iii) \"Investment\" - An Objective Criterion Under the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIt has been considered in *Salini* that the consensus of legal authors and ISCID case law is that the investment requirement under Article 25(1) is an objective condition of the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n55.\n\nThe methodology employed by the tribunals in *Salini* and in *Joy Mining* requires a claimant in an ISCID arbitration to satisfy the tribunal that:\n\na) the dispute between the parties concerns an \"investment\" within the definition provided under the relevant bilateral investment treaty; and\n\nb) the objective criterion of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) has been met.\n\nUnder the double-barrelled test, a finding that the Contract satisfied the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT would not be sufficient for this Tribunal to assume jurisdiction, if the Contract failed to satisfy the objective criterion of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25. (See Paragraph 148 below). As pointed out in *Joy Mining* (at Paragraph 50):\n\nThe parties to a dispute cannot by contract or treaty define as investment, for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction, something which does not satisfy the objective requirements of Article 25 of the Convention. Otherwise, Article 25 and its reliance on the concept of investment, even if not specifically defined, would be turned into a meaningless provision.\n\n**(iv) The Critical Cases on \"Investment\"**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThere are presently in the public domain seven decided cases of importance on the issue whether the Contract is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1). They are *Salini*, *Joy Mining*, *Jan de Nul*, *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA*, *Bayindir*, *CSOB* and, *Patrick Mitchell*. The ICSID Convention does not provide a definition of \"investment\"6 and there is no doctrine of *stare decisis* in ICSID jurisprudence. Nevertheless, an examination of similar cases decided by other ICSID tribunals will assist in determining the correct approach to this question.\n\nIn Paragraph 27 of the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention of Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of other States (\"the Report of the Executive Directors\"), dated March 18, 1965, there was express reference to the refusal to provide a definition of investment in the ICSID Convention.  \n No attempt was made to define the term \"investment\" given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre....\n\n**(v)** ***Mihaly*****,** ***Alcoa*** **and** ***SGS v Pakistan***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nBefore considering these cases, the Tribunal will discuss some cases cited by the Parties which it has not found of significant assistance in resolving the meaning of what is an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention in the present circumstances. The first case is that of *Mihaly*, which was raised by the Respondent in its oral submissions. The issue for consideration in that case was whether pre-contractual expenditure qualified as an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1).\n\n58.\n\nThe majority of the tribunal (the President of the Tribunal, Professor Sompong Sucharitkul and Mr. Andrew Rogers Q.C.)7 considered that:\n\nA crucial and essential feature of what occurred between the Claimant and the Respondent in this case was that first, the Respondent took great care in the documentation relied upon by the Claimant to point out that none of the documents, in conferring exclusivity upon the Claimant, created a contractual obligation for the building, ownership and operation of the power station. Second, the grant of exclusivity never matured into a contract. To put it rhetorically, what else could the Respondent have said to exclude any obligations which might otherwise have attached to interpret the expenditure of the moneys as an admitted investment? The operation of SAEC was contingent upon the final conclusion of the contract with Sri Lanka, thus the expenditures for its creation would not be regarded as an investment until admitted by Sri Lanka.\n\nThe other member of the Tribunal, Mr. David Suratgar, delivered a separate concurring opinion.\n\n59.\n\nThe majority held that the pre-contractual expenditure incurred by the Claimant did not fall within the meaning of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.\n\nIt is an undoubted feature of modern day commercial activity that huge sums of money may need to be expended in the process of preparing the stage for a final contract. However, the question whether an expenditure constitutes an investment or not is hardly to be governed by whether or not the expenditure is large or not. Ultimately, it is always a matter for the parties to determine at what point in their negotiations they wish to engage the provisions of the Convention by entering into an investment... The Respondent clearly signaled, in the various documents which are relied upon by the Claimant, that it was not until the execution of a contract that it was willing to accept that contractual relations had been entered into and that an investment had been made.... That type of claim is not one to which the Convention has anything to say. They are not arbitrable as a consequence of the Convention.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal finds *Mihaly* of limited utility in resolving the current dispute between the Parties. The majority decision in *Mihaly* was clearly influenced by the great care that Sri Lanka took in ensuring that it did not enter into a contractual relationship with Mihaly for the BOT project. The lack of an intention to create a contractual relationship was decisive in the majority's conclusion that the pre-contractual expenditure was not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1).\n\n61.\n\nThe present facts are quite different from those in *Mihaly*. It is undisputed that the Parties had a contractual relationship. The claims of the Claimant are based on a valid contract between the Parties.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not find *Alcoa Minerals* and *SGS v Pakistan* helpful in determining the present issue.\n\n63.\n\nIn *Alcoa Minerals*, the ICSID tribunal held that contribution of capital was said to be a kind of \"investment,\" and the Claimant relies on that holding. However, the tribunal in *Alcoa Minerals* only considered that there would be jurisdiction where \" *a private*... *company has invested substantial amounts in a foreign State in reliance upon an agreement with that State*.\" In the present case, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the amount invested by the Claimant could be described as \"substantial amounts\" for the reasons stated at Paragraphs 125-144.\n\n64.\n\nIn *SGS v Pakistan*, the issue was whether pre-inspection services offered by SGS to the customs authority of Pakistan under the agreement between SGS and Pakistan (the \"Agreement\") fell within the meaning of \"investment\" as defined in the Swiss-Pakistan bilateral investment treaty. *SGS v Pakistan* is not helpful in determining what amounts to an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention. The focus of the decision in *SGS v Pakistan* was whether the agreement fell within the meaning of \"investment\" as defined in the Swiss-Pakistan bilateral investment treaty. There was also arguably no substantive discussion by the tribunal in *SGS v Pakistan* on why the agreement was an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(vi) Discussion on the Meaning of \"Investment\"**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Reliance on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the Preamble to the ICSIDConvention and the Report of the World Bank Executive Directors in Determining the Meaning of \"Investment\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nWhen considering whether the Contract is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1), the Tribunal is guided by the spirit of the ICSID Convention and its objectives, and is mindful of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which provides that:\n\nA treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, taking a teleological approach to the interpretation of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal ought to interpret the word \"investment\" so as to encourage, facilitate and to promote cross-border economic cooperation and development. Support for such an approach can be found in the ***Preamble*** **to the ICSID Convention** (\" *Considering the need for international cooperation for economic development*....\") and the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of other States (\"the Report of the Executive Directors\") dated March 18, 1965, at Paragraph 9, which points out that the idea of ICSID was \" *prompted by the desire to strengthen the partnership between countries in the cause of economic development*.\" The ICSID Tribunal in *CSOB* considered that the phrase found in the ***Preamble*** **to the ICSID Convention** \" *permits an* *inference that an international transaction which contributes to cooperation designed to promote the economic development of a Contracting State may be deemed to be an investment as that term is understood in the Convention*.\"8\n\n*CSOB*, Award, Para. 64.\n\n67.\n\nParagraph 9 of the Report of the Executive Directors has been interpreted by *Schreuer*9 to mean that:\n\n\" *[T]he Convention's object and purpose indicate that there should be some* *positive impact on development* *!\"* (emphasis added)\n\n*Schreuer* cites *CSOB* as a case which led to a positive impact on development.\n\nSchreuer at 125\n\n68.\n\nAccordingly, the term \"investment\" should be interpreted as an activity which promotes some form of positive economic development for the host State.\n\n**(b) Hallmarks of \"Investment\" as Typical Characteristics or Jurisdictional Requirements**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(aa) Introduction**\n---------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal now considers the seven cases referred to in Paragraph 56 above.\n\n70.\n\nThe language used in some of the cases discussed below may be interpreted to advocate the defining features of \"investment\" as typical characteristics on the one hand (the \" **Typical Characteristics Approach** \"), or jurisdictional requirements on the other (the \" **Jurisdictional Approach** \"). Support for the Typical Characteristics Approach can be seen in the extract from *Schreuer* found above at Paragraph 44 above whereas the language used in *Joy Mining* goes towards supporting the Jurisdictional Approach. On the other hand, the language used in *Salini* can be used to support either of the two approaches. (See Paragraph 83 below). The differences between the Typical Characteristics Approach and the Jurisdictional Approach may only be the expression of the conclusion formed by a tribunal on the strength of the particular facts of a case on the issue of \"investment.\" While the Jurisdictional Approach, strictly defined, requires that all the established hallmarks of \"investment\" must be present before a contract can even be considered as an \"investment,\" the Typical Characteristics Approach does not necessarily mean that a tribunal would find that there is an \"investment,\" even if one or more of the established hallmarks of \"investment\" were missing. Where the evidence in support of one or more of the hallmarks of \"investment\" is weak, a tribunal may approach the issue from a holistic perspective and determine whether there is other evidence in support of the other hallmarks of \"investment\" which is so strong as to off-set the weakness in the other hallmarks of \"investment.\" However, even under the Typical Characteristics Approach, it would probably be exceptional for a tribunal to conclude that there was an \"investment\" where one or more of the hallmarks of \"investment\" were completely missing.\n\n71.\n\nA possible explanation for the apparent dichotomy between the Jurisdictional Approach and the Typical Characteristics Approach is as follows.\n\na) Where the agreed hallmarks of \"investment\" are clearly in evidence (or clearly absent), a tribunal is more likely to use language which may be interpreted as support for the Jurisdictional Approach because it can more easily rationalize its decision on the grounds of clear compliance (or lack thereof), with such hallmarks.\n\nb) Conversely, if the agreed hallmarks of \"investment,\" while present, are not so clearly evident (either in nature or extent), a tribunal, if it finds that it has jurisdiction, is more likely to use language which may be interpreted as support for the Typical Characteristics Approach.\n\nIn other words, whichever approach is adopted depends on the view of a tribunal on how the facts of the case at hand measure up against the established hallmarks of \"investment.\" (See Paragraphs 70 and 106).\n\n72.\n\nThe approach of ICSID tribunals towards the issue of \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) tends more towards an empirical rather than a doctrinaire analysis. The Typical Characteristics Approach seeks to identify the established hallmarks of \"investment,\" but cautions against casting them as prerequisites, no doubt to guard against the infinite variety of cases that would arise before ICSID tribunals that may deserve to be categorised as an \"investment\" notwithstanding the absence, whether qualitatively or quantitatively, of a particular hallmark of \"investment\" since these hallmarks of \"investment\" may be interdependent. Similarly, the Jurisdictional Approach seeks to identify these established hallmarks of \"investment\" but is expressed in such language as to lead to the conclusion that the failure to satisfy one or more of the hallmarks of \"investment\" may be fatal to an investor's claim. However, within the Jurisdictional Approach, ICSID tribunals often remark that these hallmarks may be interrelated, and must be examined in relation to other hallmarks as well as in relation to the circumstances of the case. In other words, it may be that a particular hallmark of \"investment\" may not be present when it is viewed in isolation; yet, when examined in the light of other hallmarks of \"investment\" or taking into account the circumstances of the case, a tribunal may still find jurisdiction for the Centre. (See Paragraph 106 below). An empirical approach is also consistent with interpreting the ICSID Convention in light of the intention of its drafters because the empirical approach seeks to determine the different scenarios that may meet the standard of \"investment\" which the drafters of the ICSID Convention had in mind.\n\n**(bb) The Seven Cases Discussed**\n----------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nICSID jurisprudence on the meaning of \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) typically cites *Salini* and *Joy Mining* as authorities for the various defining hallmarks of \"investment.\"\n\n74.\n\nThe factors considered in *Salini* are widely accepted as the starting point of an ICSID tribunal's analysis of whether there is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1).\n\n75.\n\nIn *Salini*, the issue was whether a construction contract could be considered as an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1). The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Autoroutes du Maroc (\"ADM\") was a Moroccan company which built, maintained and operated highways and various road-works, in accordance with a concession agreement (the \" **Concession Agreement** \") concluded with the Minister of Infrastructure and Professional & Executive Training, acting on behalf of Morocco. Within the context of the Concession Agreement, ADM issued an international invitation to tender for the construction of a highway joining Rabat to Fes. The two claimants, Salini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A, submitted a joint tender for the construction of a 50 km section of this highway. The joint tender was accepted, which led to a contract (the \" **Construction Contract** \") between the two claimants and ADM. The two claimants took 36 months to complete the works, four months longer than stipulated in the Construction Contract.\n\n76.\n\nWhen ADM rejected the claims of the two claimants, the latter sent a memorandum relating to the final account to the Minister of Infrastructure, in accordance with Article 51 of the *Cahier des Clauses Administratives Generales* (Book of General Administrative Clauses). When the two claimants did not receive any reply, they filed a Request for Arbitration against Morocco with ICSID, claiming Italian lira 132,639,617,409 as compensation for damage suffered.\n\n77.\n\nOne of the issues in dispute was whether the Construction Contract concluded between ADM and the two claimants was an \"investment\" within the meaning of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Italy and Morocco as well as under the ICSID Convention. The tribunal (comprising Dr Robert Briner as President, Dr Bernardo Cremades and Professor Ibrahim Fadlallah as co-arbitrators) ruled in favour of the two claimants, holding that the Construction Contract was an \"investment\" within the meaning of the Italian-Morocco treaty as well as under the ICSID Convention.\n\n78.\n\nThe tribunal reiterated that the \"investment\" requirement under the ICSID Convention is an objective condition that cannot be diluted by the consent of the parties. The tribunal held that:\n\nThe doctrine **generally** considers that investment infers: contributions, a certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction.... In reading the Convention's preamble, one may add the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.\n\nIn reality, these various elements may be interdependent. Thus, the risks of the transaction may depend on the contributions and the duration of performance of the contract. As a result, these various **criteria** should be assessed globally even if, for the sake of reasoning, the Tribunal considers them individually here.\" (emphasis added)\n\n79.\n\nOf the contributions made by the two claimants, the Tribunal considered that:\n\nIt is not disputed that they [i.e. the two claimants] used their know-how, that they provided the necessary equipment and qualified personnel for the accomplishment of the works, that they set up the production tool on the building site, that they obtained loans enabling them to finance the purchases necessary to carry out the works and to pay the salaries of the workforce, and finally that they agreed to the issuing of bank guarantees, in the form of a provisional guarantee fixed at 1.5% of the total sum of the tender, then at the end of the tendering process, in the form of a definite guarantee fixed at 3% of the value of the contract in dispute. The Italian companies, therefore, made contributions in money, in kind, and in industry.\n\n80.\n\nAs to the duration of the Construction Contract:\n\nAlthough the total duration for the performance of the contract, in accordance with the [contract], was fixed at 32 months, this was extended to 36 months. The transaction, therefore, complies with the minimal length of time upheld by the doctrine, which is from 2 to 5 years....\n\n81.\n\nAs to the risks incurred by the two claimants:\n\n[T]he risk associated with the prerogatives of the Owner permitting him to prematurely put to an end to the contract, to impose variations within certain limits without changing the manner of fixing prices; the risk consisting of the potential increase in the cost of labour in case of modification of Moroccan law, any accident or damages caused to property during the performance of the works; those risks relating to problems of co-ordination possibly arising from the simultaneous performance of the other projects; any unforeseeable incident that could not be considered as force majeure and which, therefore, would not give rise to a right to compensation; and finally those risks related to the absence of any compensation in case of increase or decrease in volume of the work load not exceeding 20% of the total contract price.\n\nIt does not matter in this respect that these risks were freely taken. It also does not matter that the remuneration of the Contractor was not linked to the exploitation of the completed work. A construction that stretches out over many years, for which the total costs cannot be established with certainty in advance, creates an obvious risk for the Contractor.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, as to the Construction Contract's contribution to the economic development of the host State, the tribunal said:\n\nIn most countries, the construction of infrastructure falls under the tasks to be carried out by the State or by other public authorities. It cannot be seriously contested that the highway in question shall serve the public interest. Finally, the Italian companies were also able to provide the host State of the investment with know-how in relation to the work to be accomplished.\n\nHaving undertaken the above analysis, the tribunal in *Salini* concluded that the Construction Contract was an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1).\n\n83.\n\nThe use of the words \" *generally* *considers that investment infers\"* in the passage referred to at Paragraph 78 above may indicate that the tribunal in *Salini* supported the view of *Schreuer* (at Paragraph 44 above) (*i*. *e*. *,* in support of the Typical Characteristics Approach) that the various hallmarks of \"investment\" are no more than characteristics.10 In contrast, the subsequent use of the word \"criteria\" by the tribunal in *Salini* may also indicate that the tribunal envisaged adopting a Jurisdictional Approach. However, the subsequent acknowledgment by the tribunal that the various hallmarks of \"investment\" may be interdependent and should be assessed globally indicates that the tribunal was actually approaching the issue of whether there was an \"investment\" from a fact-specific perspective.\n\n*Cf*. the emphasis placed by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Patrick Mitchell* on the use of the word \"criteria\" by the tribunal in *Salini*. The emphasis made by the *ad hoc* Committee should be seen as a response to the claimant's argument in that case that one of the characteristics of \"investment\" (contribution to the economic development of the host State) was merely a supplementary condition used to justify the broadening of the concept of investment.\n\n84.\n\nIn *Joy Mining*, the dispute concerned a contract for the provision of equipment by the claimant to the General Organization for Industrial and Mining Projects of the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"IMC\") to be used in a mining site. The total contract price amounted to \u00a313,325,293. Letters of guarantee amounting to \u00a39,605,228 were provided by the claimant to IMC. Disagreement arose between the parties as to the technical aspects of the equipment. Although the claimant was paid the full contract price, the guarantees were not released by IMC. The claimant commenced ICSID arbitration, arguing that the guarantees were an \"investment.\" In rejecting the claimant's contention, the tribunal in *Joy Mining* (Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna as President, Mr. William Laurence Craig and Judge C.G. Weeramantry as co-arbitrators) considered that:\n\nSummarizing the elements that an activity must have in order to qualify as an investment, both the ICSID decisions mentioned above and the commentators theron have indicated that the project in question should have a certain duration, a regularity of profit and return, an element of risk, a substantial commitment and that it should constitute a significant contribution to the host State's economy. To what extent these criteria are met is of course specific to each particular case as they will normally depend on the circumstances of each case. (emphasis added)\n\n85.\n\nThe tribunal in *Joy Mining* accepted the view in *Salini* that these characteristics should be examined globally, rather than in isolation. However, the earlier part of the passage may be interpreted to advocate a Jurisdictional Approach in its apparent emphasis on the mandatory nature of the hallmarks.\n\n86.\n\nThe tribunal in *Joy Mining* held that the underlying contract between the parties was a normal sale contract. The tribunal in *Joy Mining* also considered that the duration of the commitment was not particularly significant, as the price of the contract was paid in its totality at an early stage, and there was also no regularity of profit and return. Nor was there any risk apart from those typically associated with a commercial contract. It was also implicit in the Tribunal's ruling that the amount of the bank guarantee11 (\u00a39,605,228), although relatively substantial, did not constitute a significant contribution to the Egyptian economy.\n\nIn *Joy Mining*, the issue was whether bank guarantees issued in support of a project entailing the supply, installation of equipment and the provision of related incidental services for a fixed, pre-determined and certain price constituted an investment within the meaning of the bilateral investment treaty between the United Kingdom and Egypt.\n\n87.\n\nIn the course of arriving at its conclusion, the Tribunal also cited the refusal of the former Secretary-General of ICSID, Mr. I.F.I. Shihata, to register a request for arbitration in respect of a dispute arising out of a supply contract for the sale of goods, on the basis that the transaction manifestly could not be considered as an investment.\n\n88.\n\nIt can be seen that, while there was an agreement that each of the hallmarks of \"investment\" were present in this case, the degree to which these hallmarks existed was clearly at the lower end of the scale (if at all). The emphatic language of the tribunal at Paragraph 84 above may therefore be taken to reflect its clear view that the claimant had failed to satisfy the test of \"investment\" and, by emphasizing the need for these hallmarks to be satisfied, the tribunal was able to demonstrate its logic more simply than by going into a lengthy analysis of how the various factual elements of this case interacted with each other and were then assessed globally to see whether they met the ultimate test of \"investment.\"\n\n89.\n\nSome of the language used in *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* may also be interpreted to advocate a Jurisdictional Approach. In *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* (where the Tribunal comprised Professor Pierre Tercier as President, Mr. Andr\u00e9 Faur\u00e8s and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard as co-arbitrators), the dispute arose out of a concession agreement granted by *Agence Nationale des Barrages* (ANB) to the two claimants (L.E.S.I. and Dipenta) for the construction of a dam. In 2001, ANB terminated the contract on the ground of *force majeure*. The two claimants then commenced an ICSID arbitration. The ICSID tribunal held that:\n\nThese decisions [citing amongst others, *CSOB*, *SGS v Pakistan* and *SGS v The Philippines* ] do not, however, provide clear guidelines, but seem rather to be based on choices made case-by-case. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that some objective criteria emerge from those cases, sufficient to guarantee a degree of security.\n\nIt would seem consistent with the objective of the Convention that a contract, in order to be considered an investment within the meaning of the provision, should fulfill the following three **conditions** :  \n a) the contracting party has made contributions in the host country;  \n b) those contributions had a certain duration; and  \n c) they involved some risks for the contributor.  \n On the other hand, it is not necessary that the investment contribute more specifically to the host country's economic development, something that is difficult to ascertain and that is implicitly covered by the other three criteria. (emphasis added)\n\n90.\n\nIn a similar vein, the *ad hoc* Committee in *Patrick Mitchell* (comprising Mrs. Antonias Dimolitsa as President, Mr. Robert S.M. Dossou and Professor Andrea Giardina) also used language which may be interpreted to favour the Jurisdictional Approach.12\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that *Patrick Mitchell* has been the subject of much criticism over the manner in which the *ad hoc* Committee exercised its powers of annulment. However, the Tribunal will only refer to *Patrick Mitchell* for the views of the *ad hoc* Committee on the concept of \"investment.\" The Tribunal makes no comment, and places no reliance, on the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee to annul the award of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n91.\n\nIn that case, Mr. Patrick Mitchell of the law firm Mitchell & Associates commenced ICSID arbitration proceedings against the Democratic Republic of Congo (the \" **DRC** \") pursuant to a bilateral investment treaty entered into between the United States of America and the DRC (the \" **USA-DRC BIT** \"). The dispute arose from the decision of the Military Court of the DRC to seal the premises housing Mr. Mitchell's firm and the consequent seizure of various documents and items in his firm. His employees were also forced to leave the premises. Two of the lawyers in his firm were in fact arrested and subsequently released. Mr. Mitchell alleged that the acts of the DRC amounted to an expropriation in violation of Article III(1) of the USA-DRC BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal hearing the dispute ruled that the dispute fell within the jurisdiction of the Centre and its competence. DRC then applied for annulment of the award on the ground, *inter alia*, that the Arbitral Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its power with regard to its own jurisdiction in respect of the definition of \"investment\" (*i*. *e*. *,* declaring itself to have jurisdiction over the dispute on the basis there was an \"investment\" when there was none).\n\n92.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Patrick Mitchell* had to deal with the argument made by counsel for the claimant that the \"economic development of the host State\" characteristic of \"investment\" was a \" *supplementary condition used heretofore in order to justify the broadening of the concept of investment and as somewhat duplicating with the investor's commitment*.\"\n\n93.\n\nThe arguments between the parties focused on whether the characteristic of \"contribution to the economic development of the host State\" was an \"essential element\" of investment (as submitted by DRC), or simply a supplementary condition used to justify the broadening of the concept of \"investment\" and duplicative of other characteristics of \"investment\" (as submitted by the claimant).\n\n94.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Patrick Mitchell* rejected the claimant's argument and stated that the \"contribution to the economic development of the host State\" characteristic of \"investment\" is \" *an essential - although not sufficient - characteristic or unquestionable criterion of the investment*.\" The *ad hoc* Committee cited, *inter alia*, the ***Preamble*** **to the ICSID Convention** (see Paragraph 66 above), *Salini*, *CSOB* (see Paragraphs 97-98 below) and *Schreuer* before arriving at their conclusion. The *ad hoc* Committee concluded that this particular characteristic of \"investment\" was an \"unquestionable criterion\" of \"investment\" which might be satisfied by showing that the investor's operation contributed in one way or another to the economic development of the host State.\n\n95.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Patrick Mitchell* stated that the ICSID Tribunal in *CSOB* had observed that \" *Under certain circumstances a loan may contribute* *substantially to a State's economic development*... *the undertaking involved a significant contribution by CSOB to the economic development of the Slovak Republic* *within the meaning of the Convention* \" and also highlighted a statement in *Schreuer* commenting that the \"contribution to the economic development of the host State\" characteristic of \"investment\" is \" *the only possible indication of an objective meaning of* *the term \u2018investment'*.\"\n\n96.\n\nAlthough the *ad hoc* Committee suggested that the \"contribution to the economic development of the host State\" characteristic of \"investment\" was an \" *essential -although not sufficient characteristic or unquestionable criterion*,\" it managed to dilute this strict approach by stating that this would be satisfied where the underlying contract or operation contributed in one way or another to the economic development of the host State. The *ad hoc* Committee also emphasised that the concept of economic development is \" *extremely broad but also variable depending on the case*.\"\n\n97.\n\nIn contrast, *CSOB* (where the Tribunal consisted of Professor Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal, Professor Piero Bernardini and Professor Andreas Bucher as co-arbitrators) may be interpreted as favouring the Typical Characteristics Approach.\n\n98.\n\nIn *CSOB*, the dispute arose out of a contract called the Consolidation Agreement between the claimant and the Ministries of Finance of the Czech and Slovak Republics. The Consolidation Agreement provided for the assignment by CSOB of certain nonperforming receivables to two companies which were specifically created for this purpose (the \"Collection Companies\"). The Collection Companies were to pay CSOB for these receivables. To enable these Collection Companies to finance the assignment, they received loans from CSOB. The loans were secured by a guarantee from the Slovak Ministry of Finance. When the Collection Companies in Slovakia defaulted on their payment obligations, CSOB commenced an ICSID arbitration against Slovakia. The tribunal held that:\n\nthese elements of the suggested definition,13 while they tend as a rule to be present in most investments, are not a formal prerequisite for the finding that a transaction constitutes an investment as that concept is understood under the Convention.\" (emphasis added)\n\nThe tribunal relied on the definition used by the respondent (the Slovak Republic), which defined \"investment\" essentially as the acquisition of property or assets through the expenditure of resources by one party in the territory of a foreign country which was expected to produce a benefit on both sides and to offer a return in the future, subject to the uncertainties of the risk involved.\n\n99.\n\nIn *Bayindir* (where the tribunal comprised Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as President, Sir Franklin Berman Q.C. and Professor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel as coarbitrators), the dispute arose out of a contract to construct a six-lane motorway and ancillary works known as the \"Pakistan Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway\" between the claimant and the National Highway Authority (a public corporation established under Pakistani laws). In determining whether there was an \"investment,\" the Tribunal took the view that *Salini* :\n\nheld that the notion of investment presupposes the following elements : (a) a contribution, (b) a certain duration over which the project is implemented, (c) sharing of the operational risks, and (d) a contribution to the host State's development, being understood that these elements may be closely interrelated, should be examined in their totality, and will normally depend on the circumstances of each case. (emphasis added)\n\n100.\n\nAlthough the tribunal in *Bayindir* stated that \" *to qualify as an investment*,\" the project in question must satisfy the elements identified in the above passage, it is more important to appreciate that the tribunal indicated that these elements \" *may be closely interrelated, should be examined in their totality, and will normally depend on the circumstances of each case*.\"\n\n101.\n\nIn *Jan de Nul* (Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as President, Professor Pierre Mayer and Professor Brigitte Stern as co-arbitrators), the tribunal, in considering treaty claims arising out of the contract between the two claimants (Jan De Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V.) and the Suez Canal Authority (a public agency established under Egyptian law) to deepen and widen the Suez Canal), found as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with ICSID precedents which, subject to minor variations, have relied on the so-called \"Salini test.\" Such test identifies the following elements as **indicative** of an \u2018investment' for the purposes of the ICSID Convention: (i) a contribution, (ii) a certain duration over which the project is implemented, (iii) a sharing of operational risks, and (iv) a contribution to the host State's development, being [sic] understood that these elements may be closely interrelated, should be examined in their totality and will normally depend on the circumstances of each case. (emphasis added)\n\n102.\n\nThe tribunal in *Jan de Nul*, in applying the so-called \" *Salini* test\" emphasised (as did the tribunals in *Salini* and *Bayindir*) that the various elements/or hallmarks of \"investment,\" must be \" *examined in their totality and will normally depend on the circumstances of each case*.\"\n\n103.\n\nEven in *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA*, the approach of the tribunal to the various conditions identified which must be satisfied before a contract could be considered as an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention suggests that it took a very broad approach to the meaning of \"investment.\" In other words, the tribunal would not require clear evidence to establish a finding that each of the relevant hallmarks was present. Such an approach may, in practice, dilute the Jurisdictional Approach to such an extent that, in substance, it may not be significantly different from the Typical Characteristics Approach.\n\n104.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the purpose of analyzing these cases above is not slavishly to adhere to precedent, but rather to discern a broad trend which emerges from ICSID jurisprudence on the \"investment\" requirement under the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(cc) Significance of the Dichotomy**\n--------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nIn any event, the differences between the two approaches are likely to be academic. In practice, it is unlikely that any difference in juristic analysis would make any significant difference to the ultimate finding of the tribunal. The existence of two possible approaches may be the result of the different emphases placed by the tribunal on each of the factors because the facts (or Counsel's submissions) in one case may require (or encourage) the tribunal to place a stronger emphasis on a particular factor than in another case. This will happen where, although the requisite hallmarks of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention appear to exist, the presence of one or more hallmarks may appear weak, and the tribunal may need to look at the strength of the other hallmarks in arriving at its decision.\n\n106.\n\nFurthermore, ICSID tribunals tend to adopt an empirical rather than a doctrinaire approach in determining whether there is an \"investment\" within Article 25(1). This may be termed a Newtonian rather than a Cartesian approach (*i*. *e*. moving from the particular to the general rather than *vice versa*).\n\na) Where the facts are strongly in favour of a finding in each of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment,\" a tribunal can confirm its jurisdiction in strong terms emphasizing that the requirements of \"investment\" are clearly fulfilled. Such strong language may be interpreted in support of a Jurisdictional Approach. However, it may simply indicate the tribunal's views on the weakness of a respondent's jurisdictional challenge in that each of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment\" has clearly been satisfied by the claimant. (See discussion of *Bayindir* at Paragraphs 99-100 above).\n\nb) Where the facts clearly show that one or more of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment\" are missing, a tribunal may uphold the jurisdictional challenge of a respondent in strong terms by using language in support of a Jurisdictional Approach in order to demonstrate more clearly why the tribunal is rejecting jurisdiction. (See discussion of *Joy Mining* at Paragraphs 84-88 above).\n\nc) Where the facts are not as clear-cut as in the scenarios envisaged in a) and b) above, a tribunal will have to consider whether there is any evidence in support of each of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment.\" Where there is some marginal evidence in support of one of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment,\" but more conclusive evidence in support the presence of the other relevant hallmarks of \"investment,\" the tribunal may choose to discount the weakness of the claimant's case in one of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment\" by stating that the issue of \"investment\" should be approached on a holistic basis. Put another way, while it is still necessary to fulfill the formal requirements of \"investment\" by demonstrating that the facts meet all the established hallmarks of \"investment,\" weak or superficial compliance with one of the hallmarks of \"investment\" may be compensated by more compelling evidence in the other hallmarks of \"investment\" so that, in the global assessment of the various factual elements, a tribunal may still conclude that there is an \"investment\" because these hallmarks of \"investment\" are (in the language of *Salini*) interdependent. In this situation, a tribunal is likely to use language that may be interpreted as advocating a Typical Characteristics Approach. (See discussion of *Jan de Nul* at Paragraphs 101-102 above).\n\nd) Alternatively, in the scenario described in c) above, a tribunal may also rely on a Jurisdictional Approach but, in examining whether each of the relevant hallmarks of \"investment\" is satisfied, the tribunal may take a broad approach, requiring only relatively marginal evidence to establish a positive finding in favour of assuming ICSID jurisdiction. The tribunal may also state, in its overall assessment of the factual elements that, notwithstanding compliance with all the hallmarks of \"investment,\" the qualitative manner in which these hallmarks are satisfied are insufficient to satisfy the overall test of \"investment.\" In other words, the hallmarks, although essential, are not sufficient to ensure that a contract is an \"investment.\" (See discussion of *Patrick Mitchell* at Paragraphs 90-96 above).\n\ne) The classical *Salini* hallmarks are not a punch list of items which, if completely checked off, will automatically lead to a conclusion that there is an \"investment.\" If any of these hallmarks are absent, the tribunal will hesitate (and probably decline) to make a finding of \"investment.\" However, even if they are all present, a tribunal will still examine the nature and degree of their presence in order to determine whether, on a holistic assessment, it is satisfied that there is an ICSID \"investment.\" The *ad hoc* Committee's remarks in *Patrick Mitchell* quoted in Paragraph 94 above (essential but insufficient characteristic or criterion of investment) can reasonably apply, not merely to the requirement of contribution to the host State's economic development, but to all the *Salini* hallmarks.\n\n**(c) Consideration of the Characteristics of \"Investment\" Applied to the Present Case**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nHaving completed the legal analysis of the relevant authorities, the Tribunal now turns to consider to what degree the hallmarks of \"investment\" are met in the present case, adopting a fact-specific and holistic assessment.\n\n**(aa) Lack of Regularity of Profit and Returns is Immaterial in Relation to thePresent Facts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal first considers a hallmark of \"investment\" cited in *Joy Mining*, which is that there must be regularity of profits and returns. This particular hallmark did not feature in the so-called *Salini* test, although it is mentioned in *Schreuer*. There is no regularity of profits and returns on the present facts. However, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's answer in response, which is that this criterion may not always be decisive. The example of the pharmaceutical company cited by the Claimant in its \"PostJurisdiction Hearing Notes & Points\" is apt,14 and the Tribunal agrees that this criterion is not always critical. Further, this has not been held to be an essential characteristic or criterion in any other case cited in this Award, and its presence or otherwise may therefore not be determinative of the question of \"investment.\" The Claimant also points out that, although there was no regularity of profits and returns in this case, there was a regular and steady accretion of \"investment\" (presumably meaning expenditure) as work progressed on the DIANA Project, and more and more items were salvaged. Accordingly, taking into account that this is not a classical hallmark of \"investment\" and the submissions of the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that the absence of this hallmark is immaterial for the reasons stated by the Claimant.\n\nThe Claimant cites the example of a pharmaceutical company's investment in the development of a drug as an example of an investment which does not have regularity of profit and return. The Claimant points out that, before any profit and return could be realized, the drug would have to be discovered, tested, approved by the regulatory authorities, and accepted by the market. This is a costly process that could take several years. The Claimant argues that, during such time, there could be a build-up and accretion of investment, but no return on investment as such.\n\n**(bb) Contributions**\n----------------------\n\n109.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the Claimant has expended its own funds, whether in the form of equipment, know-how or personnel, or in the performance of the Contract in its entirety, without any cash payment or other financial assistance from the Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has, like the claimants in *Salini*, made contributions in money, in kind and in industry although, as the Respondent has pointed out in its submissions of December 14 2006, the size of the contributions were in no way comparable to those found in *Salini*, *Bayindir* and *Jan de Nul* or even in *Joy Mining*. Furthermore, the nature of the Claimant's contributions are largely similar to those which might have been made under a commercial salvage contract (albeit with additional obligations in assisting in the ultimate sale of the salvaged articles).\n\n**(cc) Duration of the Contract**\n---------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Contract took almost four years to complete. Accordingly, it complies with the minimum length of time of two to five years, as discussed in *Salini*. However, owing to the nature of the Contract, the Claimant only managed to satisfy this factor in a quantitative sense. The original stipulated duration of the Contract was only for 18 months, which was extended by mutual consent. One might well argue that the Contract was only able to meet the minimum length of time of two years because of the element of fortuity (since the duration of the Contract depended largely on how long the Claimant would take to find and salvage the DIANA). The nature of the project meant that the Claimant could have completed it within a shorter period than two years and was in fact contractually required to do so within 18 months.\n\n111.\n\nThe ICSID tribunals in *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* and *Bayindir* considered that, in the context of construction contracts, one could take into consideration the time extensions that would often be required in determining whether a contract was an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1). In the Tribunal's view, the key reason for in allowing time extensions to be considered was motivated by the fact that, in *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA*, the tribunal suggested that an assessment of the criterion of duration was linked to whether the contract was for an operation that promoted the economy and the development of the host State.15 Presumably, the longer the duration, the greater the economic commitment. Where the underlying contract does not promote the economy and development of the host State, there may be less justification to factor in the extensions granted under the Contract. The Tribunal, therefore, considers that:\n\na) since the duration of the Contract was dependent, in part, on the element of fortuity, and\n\nb) for the reasons stated at Paragraphs 113-145 below, this Contract does not appear to be a contract that would promote the economy and development of the host State as the criterion of duration is not satisfied in the qualitative sense envisaged by ICSID jurisprudence.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that, although the Claimant satisfies the duration characteristic or criterion in the quantitative sense, it fails to do so in the qualitative sense. However, such failure does not, by itself, mean that the project was not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) since a holistic assessment of all the hallmarks still needs to be made.\n\nThe reason why the tribunal in *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* did not consider the feature of significant contribution to the host State to be a separate feature was because this particular feature is, according to the tribunal, implicitly covered by the three so-called classical *Salini* characteristics/criteria (*i*. *e*., contribution, duration and risk). In contrast, the tribunal in *Salini* and *Joy Mining* also took into consideration the fourth characteristic/criteria (*i*. *e*., contribution to the economic development of the host State). Schreuer mentions a fifth characteristic/criterion (*i*. *e*., regularity of profit and return).\n\n**(dd) Risks Assumed Under the Contract**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIt is not in dispute that all the risks of the Contract were borne by the Claimant. The fact that these risks were not in any way borne by the Respondent would appear to afford a stronger reason to hold that the activity is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) as compared to an investment where the risks were shared. However, it has been conceded by counsel for the Claimant that salvage contracts are often on a \"no-finds-no-pay\" basis. This would not necessarily mean that all salvage contracts would be an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1), assuming this feature of investment to be the only factor in doubt. This is because the characteristics of \"investment\" identified by the tribunals in ICSID jurisprudence must be considered globally. The fact that the risks under these contracts would be assumed by the salvor does not necessarily lead to the inevitable conclusion that the salvage contract must be considered as an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention. The nature of a salvage contract would mean that the assumption of risk by the salvor would be inherent in the transaction, rather than a special feature of the Contract which affected the salvor's decision to undertake the project in question. The fact that salvage contracts are typically on a \"no-finds-no-pay\" basis is evidence that the risks assumed under the Contract were no more than ordinary commercial risks assumed by many salvors in a salvage contract. The Claimant has not provided any convincing reasons why the risks assumed under the Contract were anything other than normal commercial risks. It is clear under ICSID practice and jurisprudence that an ordinary commercial contract cannot be considered as an \"investment.\"16 While the Claimant may have satisfied the risk characteristic or criterion in a quantitative sense (*i*. *e*., that there was inherent risk assumed under the Contract), the quality of the assumed risk was not something which established ICSID practice and jurisprudence would recognize. Accordingly, since the Claimant can only superficially satisfy the so-called classical *Salini* features of investment, in the qualitative sense envisaged under established ICSID practice and jurisprudence, consideration of the remaining hallmarks of \"investment\" will assume greater significance on the particular facts of the case.\n\n*See* the decision of the former Secretary-General of ICSID Mr. I.F.I. Shihata not to register a request for arbitration in respect of a dispute arising out of a ordinary sale of goods contract; *Joy Mining* where the tribunal, in arriving at its conclusion that there was no jurisdiction, considered that risk inherent in a normal commercial contract would not be sufficient.\n\n**(ee) Economic Development of Host State**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has to consider whether the Contract contributed to the economic development of Malaysia. There appears to be a difference in ICSID jurisprudence as to whether there is a need for a contract to make a significant contribution to the economic development of the host State. The tribunal in *Salini* considered that there should be a contribution to such economic development without stressing that it must be \"significant.\" However, on the facts of that case, it was likely that the tribunal would have formed the view that the contribution was significant. The tribunal in *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* took the view that this requirement need not even be considered, because it was implicitly covered in the previous three characteristics of an \"investment.\"\n\n114.\n\nOn the other hand, the tribunal in *Joy Mining* took the view that, to qualify as an \"investment,\" the contribution to the economic development of the host State must be \"significant.\"\n\n115.\n\nThe *Bayindir* tribunal cited *Joy Mining* in saying that an \"investment\" should be significant to the host State's development. The tribunal in *Bayindir* then cited *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* to assert that this condition was often already included in the other three criteria of \"investment.\" On the facts, the *Bayindir* tribunal considered that the respondent did not dispute that a road infrastructure project would be important to the development of the country. The *Bayindir* tribunal's interpretation of *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA* suggests that it considered the possibility that, while this hallmark would usually be subsumed within the previous three hallmarks of \"investment,\" there might be situations where it would not be so subsumed. It also endorsed the general view that a contribution had to be significant to the host State's development.\n\n116.\n\nThe tribunal in *Jan de Nul*, citing *Salini*, *Bayindir* and *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA*, stated that a contribution to the host State's development would be indicative of an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1). The tribunal took the view that, on the facts, the contract was of \" *paramount significance* \" to the host State's economy and development. (See Para 92 of the Award).\n\n117.\n\nIn *CSOB*, the tribunal also made a finding that the contract made a significant contribution to the economic development of the host State.\n\n118.\n\nIn *Patrick Mitchell*, the *ad hoc* Committee departed from *L*. *E*. *S*. *I*. *-DIPENTA*, and considered this hallmark of \"investment\" as \" ***an essential*** **-** ***although not sufficient*** **-*****characteristic or unquestionable criterion*****\" of \"investment**.\" (See Paragraph 94 above). However, the *ad hoc* Committee added that this \" *does not mean that this contribution must always be sizable or successful*....\" The *ad hoc* Committee also stated that it\n\n\" *suffices for the operation to contribute in one way or another to the economic* *development of the host State, and this concept of economic development is, in any event, extremely broad but also variable depending on the case*.\"\n\n119.\n\nIn contrast, the tribunal in *PSEG* (comprising Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a as President, Mr. Yves Fortier Q.C. and Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as coarbitrators) did not appear, at first blush, to consider it important for an \"investment\" to contribute significantly to the economy of the host State. In *PSEG*, a Concession Contract was signed between the Claimant and the Republic of Turkey to construct a power plant on a Build-Operate-Transfer model (\"BOT Model\"). The tribunal (see Paragraphs 80-90 of the Decision on Jurisdiction) appeared to conclude that it had jurisdiction over the dispute simply because the Concession Contract was signed by the parties. Hence it appears to suggest that the existence of a valid contract would lead to the assumption of jurisdiction by the tribunal. The tribunal did not discuss how the Concession Contract amounted to an \"investment\" within Article 25, nor did it cite the *Salini* criteria in arriving at its conclusion. The summary of the Republic of Turkey's arguments in *PSEG* provided in the tribunal's decision does not indicate that it had placed emphasis on the application of the *Salini* criteria. In this Tribunal's view, the main reason why the *PSEG* tribunal did not discuss the *Salini* criteria was because the investment in question was a \"readily recognizable investment.\" The concept of \"readily recognizable investment\" was cited in *Schreuer* and credited to Dr. Aron Broches who, during the debate over the draft of the Executive Directors' Report, \" *recalled that none of the suggested definitions for the word \u2018investment' had proved acceptable*.... *[W]hile it might be difficult to define the term, an investment was in fact readily recognizable*.\"\n\n120.\n\nThe following facts were present in *PSEG*.\n\na) The original amount of investment envisaged in the Concession Contract amounted to US$804.8 million. The claimant had issued a performance bond worth US$8,848 million pursuant to the Concession Contract (although the performance bond was not subsequently renewed when it expired). These two facts would have satisfied the characteristic/criterion of contribution under the *Salini* test.\n\nb) Although the Concession Contract provided for economic adjustments under Article 8, paragraph 3 of the Concession Contract, there would still be risks for the claimant in that any costs expended would not be recovered if the respondent rejected the claimant's revision of the tariffs that it could charge under the Concession Contract \" *on the basis of reasonable grounds*.\" In such a situation, if the claimant \" *abandons the project prior to the construction start date, the [claimant] and the [respondent] shall have no claim against one another*.\" If the claimant had expended costs discharging its obligations under the Concession Contract after its execution, there would obviously have been risk assumed by the claimant. Furthermore, the fact that the Contract did not contain any specific provision on dispute settlement would also contain a certain amount of risk for the claimant, especially from the view of securing financing for the project.\n\nc) Although the Decision on Jurisdiction in *PSEG* did not specify the duration needed to build the power plant, it would be reasonable to assume that, in view of the complex scale of the project, which envisaged the power plant to run for 38 years and the total investment to run up to US$804.8 million, the duration needed for the construction of the power plant would meet the duration characteristic/criterion stated in ICSID jurisprudence of two to five years. (See Paragraph 110 above).\n\nd) The Concession Contract was for the construction of a power plant which, on any account, must have been of benefit to the economy of the Republic of Turkey. This would satisfy the characteristic/criterion of economic development to the host State.\n\ne) As the project was envisaged to be a BOT Model, it would also satisfy the final characteristic/criterion of regularity of profits and returns since the claimant would be allowed to operate the power plant for a number of years and charge an appropriate tariff for the sale of the electricity generated.\n\n121.\n\nAgainst that background, it is easily understandable why the tribunal in *PSEG* assumed jurisdiction over the dispute. The *Salini* test was so obviously satisfied in *PSEG* that a detailed discussion of its application was unnecessary.17\n\nIt is inconceivable that the tribunal in *PSEG* was not intending to apply the *Salini* test when the decision in *Joy Mining* was made by Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna as the presiding arbitrator and the decisions in *Bayindir* and *Jan de Nul* were made by Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as presiding arbitrator.\n\n122.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal is inclined to agree with the Respondent's analysis of *PSEG* that the Concession Contract must, by its nature, constitute a paramount significance to the economic development of the host State and, therefore, satisfying the requirement of contributing to the economy of the host State on the facts in *PSEG* because the power plant project in the *PSEG* case \" *was of* \u2018 *such magnitude and complexity* ' *and involved a risk to the extent that the operation of the project constitutes a paramount significance in* *the economy and development of the country*.\"18\n\n*PSEG* (quoting Para. 13 of the Respondent's Comments dated 22 March 2007).\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the weight of the authorities cited above swings in favour of requiring a significant contribution to be made to the host State's economy. Were there not the requirement of significance, any contract which enhances the Gross Domestic Product of an economy by any amount, however small, would qualify as an \"investment.\" It also bears noting that in *Joy Mining*, the value of the bank guarantee had a value of GBP 9.6 million and yet did not qualify as a contribution to the economy of Egypt. Taking into account the entire factual matrix of the case, this feature may be of considerable, even decisive, importance. This is due in part to the Tribunal's findings that the other features of \"investment,\" such as risk and duration of contract, only appear to be superficially satisfied on the facts of this case, and not in the qualitative sense envisaged under ICSID practice and jurisprudence. The Tribunal is therefore left only with the contributions made by the Claimant, and has to determine whether these contributions would represent a significant contribution to the host State's economic development.\n\n124.\n\nIn unusual situations such as the present case, where many of the typical hallmarks of \"investment\" are not decisive or appear to be only superficially satisfied, the analysis of the remaining relevant hallmarks of \"investment\" will assume considerable importance. The Tribunal therefore considers that, on the present facts, for it to constitute an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention, the Contract must have made a significant contribution to the economic development of the Respondent.\n\n**(ff) Whether There Was Economic Contribution to Malaysia's Economic Development Under the Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nAny contract would have made some economic contribution to the place where it is performed. However, that does not automatically make a contract an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1). As stated by *Schreuer*, there must be positive impact on a host State's development. *Schreuer* cites *CSOB* in concluding that an \"investment\" must have a positive impact on a host State and, in *CSOB*, the tribunal stated that there must be significant contributions to the host State's economic development.\n\n126.\n\nThe approach of *Schreuer* and *CSOB* can be contrasted with the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Patrick Mitchell*, which endorsed a broader approach, simply requiring some form of contribution to the economy of the host State in one way or another.\n\n127.\n\nIn that case (see Paragraphs 90-96 above), the *ad hoc* Committee observed that the case at hand did not involve a \"readily recognizable\" \"investment\" and it was the first time such a claim was brought before the Centre.\n\n128.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee also considered that a law firm is an uncommon operation from the standpoint of the concept of \"investment.\" Accordingly, the *ad hoc* Committee indicated that it was necessary for the contribution to the economic development (or at least the interests of the host State DRC) to be somehow present in the operation of the law firm. The *ad hoc* Committee also stated that it would be necessary for the award to show how Mr. Mitchell, through his know-how, concretely assisted the DRC by providing legal services in a regular manner by specifically bringing investors into the DRC. The *ad hoc* Committee held that the award failed to show all these elements. According to the *ad hoc* Committee, the vague references in the award to, *inter alia*, declarations made by former clients of the law firm, agreements and the loss of such clients failed to fill the gaps created in the award. The *ad hoc C* ommittee also criticized the tribunal for failing to explain in its award why the relationship between the law firm and the DRC should be regarded as an \"investment.\" The *ad hoc C* ommittee was at pains to emphasize that inadequate reasoning in the award might open the door for genuine abuse to the extent that it would grant the qualification of \"investor\" to any law firm established in a foreign country and enable the law firm to take advantage of the special arbitration system of ICSID.\n\n129.\n\nIn the present case, the Contract is not a \"readily recognizable\" \"investment.\" This is also the first time a marine salvage claim has been brought before the Centre.\n\n130.\n\nViewing all the circumstances of the factual matrix in this case, the Tribunal finds that the question of contribution to the host State's economic development assumes significant importance because the other typical hallmarks of \"investment\" are either not decisive or appear only to be superficially satisfied. (See Paragraph 124 above).\n\n131.\n\nUnlike the Construction Contract in *Salini* which, when completed, constituted an infrastructure that would benefit the Moroccan economy and serve the Moroccan public interest, the Tribunal finds that the Contract did not benefit the Malaysian public interest in a material way or serve to benefit the Malaysian economy in the sense developed by ICSID jurisprudence, namely that the contributions were significant.\n\n132.\n\nIn the oral proceedings, the Claimant attempted to show that the Contract did provide some form of benefit to the Malaysian economy, when it was indicated during a presentation by Mr. Dorian Ball, the Director of the Claimant, that local residents were employed by the Claimant to \" *wash, pack, inventorise and photograph the porcelains* \" (see page 181, at line 21-23, of the transcripts of the hearing of May 25, 2006) salvaged from the DIANA. To the extent that the Claimant had provided gainful employment to these Malaysians, the Tribunal accepts that the Contract did benefit the Malaysian public interest and economy to some extent. However, this benefit is not of the same quality or quantity envisaged in previous ICSID jurisprudence. The benefits which the Contract brought to the Respondent are largely cultural and historical. These benefits, and any other direct financial benefits to the Respondent, have not been shown to have led to significant contributions to the Respondent's economy in the sense envisaged in ICSID jurisprudence.\n\n133.\n\nThe oral submissions were subsequently elaborated upon in the post-hearing submissions where the Claimant submitted, *inter alia*, that it had employed over 40 people in Malaysia, as well as a village of local residents, imparted valuable know-how and knowledge on the science and process of historical marine salvage, which would ultimately benefit Malaysian museums, and its performance under the Contract had raised Malaysia's international profile and drew welcome attention to Malaysia as a favourable and attractive location or destination for history, treasure, archaeology and revenuegenerating tourism. The Claimant also argued that the Contract had contributed over US$1 million in cash to the Malaysian treasury.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimant also elaborated on the Contract's \"contribution\" to the development of the host State in its submissions of December 17, 2006. It also listed some 27 categories of contributions to the Respondent's development. The Claimant submits that, while its contributions may be small compared to the contributions of electrical utilities, oil exploration companies or highway builders, the contribution from the Contract was the largest within the salvage industry (at least US$3.8 million), and it is in that particular frame of reference within which its contributions and commitments must be measured.19\n\nCompare this to the GBP 9.6 million value of the bank guarantees in *Joy Mining* which was deemed insufficient by the tribunal in that case.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant's submission of December 17, 2006, that its contribution must be measured in the context of the fact that it was the largest in the industry. The frame of reference for the purposes of determining whether the Contract is an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention cannot depend on whether the Contract is the largest ever made within its particular industry. To determine whether the Contract is an \"investment,\" the litmus test must be its overall contribution to the economy of the host State, Malaysia.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimant also observes (in its submissions of December 17, 2006) that, in *Patrick Mitchell*, the *ad hoc* Committee stated that the reason why, in some cases, the characteristic of economic development of the host State had not been expressly mentioned was because the facts in question in those cases concerned state contracts, which would have had an obvious and unquestioned impact on the development of the host State. The Claimant seeks to apply this argument to the present facts. The Claimant argues that the Contract was specifically and exclusively provided to the Respondent, and the Contract directly benefited the Respondent, and had a public purpose or interest. The Claimant submits that the Contract concretely assisted the Respondent and contributed to its economic as well as cultural development. The Claimant also points out that the successful salvage of the DIANA raised the Respondent's profile and generated highly-desired attention to the Respondent. The Claimant says that the Respondent clearly considered the cultural and political benefits of the successful salvage of the DIANA to be more important and valuable than financial or commercial results. The Claimant also says that the most important consideration of all is the transfer of know-how by it to the officials of the Respondent which imparted an independent marine salvage capability to the Respondent.\n\n137.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent submits (in its submissions of December 14, 2006) that the salvage operation did not involve any or any significant contribution to its economic development. The Respondent submits that the Contract was merely concerned with the recovery of the DIANA and (as expressed in the Preamble to the Contract) was for the sole purpose of archaeological interest and the study of historical heritage. The Respondent submits that the financial spending and outlays of resources by the claimants in *Salini* and *Bayindir* were in response to the need for development of the infrastructure in the host State whereas, on the present facts, the Contract merely envisaged a recovery of artefacts from the sea, and such a venture was merely a contract for services and did not contribute significantly to Malaysia's economic development. The Respondent cites Clause 15.1 of the Contract which provides that the Respondent \" *shall not commercially exploit such rights in relation to the finds except in so far as to propagate education, tourism, museums, culture and history* \" as further proof that there was no significant contribution to the economic development of the Respondent. The Respondent also argues that there was no transfer of know-how or technology to it; and that the Contract is merely a standard salvage contract and not an \"investment\" in any sense of the word. The Respondent also emphasizes the distinction between it entering into a contract as a \"merchant\" and as a \"sovereign.\"\n\n138.\n\nNot every contract entered into with a sovereign state will have a positive impact on the economic development of the host State in the sense envisaged under the ICSID Convention. Although the Contract was directly entered into by the Claimant with the Respondent, that does not *ipso facto* make the Contract an \"investment\" within the ICSID Convention. The economic impact of the benefits of the Contract must be assessed to determine whether there was an \"investment.\" Accordingly, the Tribunal must reject any perceived political or cultural benefits arising from the Contract in assessing whether it constituted an \"investment\" except where such benefits would have had a significant impact on the Respondent's economic development. Stripped of all political and cultural benefits arising from the Contract, the Tribunal must assess whether the benefits arising from the Contract were simply a commercial benefit arising from the Contract or whether the Contract provided a significant contribution to the Respondent's economy.\n\n139.\n\nIt should not be thought that investments of relatively small cash sums can never amount to an \"investment.\" Investments can be valued in ways other than pure cash, *e*.*g*. as human capital or intellectual property rights. So long as the putative investor has committed to making a contribution which results in some form of positive economic development, this *Salini* hallmark can be fulfilled, although subject always to the balancing exercise described in Paragraphs 106(c) and (d) above.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to examine previous ICSID jurisprudence to determine what kind of contributions have been held by ICSID tribunals to constitute a significant contribution to the economy of the host State.\n\n141.\n\nAs explained by *Schreuer*20 and *CSOB*, the contract which the claimant had with the Collection Company in *CSOB* was instrumental to the development of the host State's banking infrastructure.\n\nSchreuer at 121.\n\n142.\n\nIn *Jan de Nul* and *Bayindir*, the substantial contributions manifested themselves in the form of public infrastructure projects which were of permanent value, and they provided tangible benefits to the host State's economic development.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, even accepting the evidence of the Claimant as raised in its oral submissions, the post-hearing submissions and its submissions of December 17, 2006, the Contract did not make any significant contributions to the economic development of Malaysia. The Tribunal considers that these factors indicate that, while the Contract did provide some benefit to Malaysia, they did not make a sufficient contribution to Malaysia's economic development to qualify as an \"investment\" for the purposes of Article 25(1) or Article 1(a) of the BIT. While the Tribunal is aware of the comment in *Mihaly* that \" *the question whether an expenditure constitutes an investment or not is hardly to be governed by whether or not the expenditure is large or not*,\" the Tribunal concludes that there was no substantial contribution because the nature of the benefits that the Contract offered to Malaysia did not provide substantial benefits in the sense envisaged in previous ICISD jurisprudence such as *CSOB*, *Jan de Nul* and *Bayindir*.21\n\n*C*. *f*. *Joy Mining* where the ICSID Tribunal ruled that a bank guarantee for over GBP9.6 million did not contribute a significant contribution to the Egyptian economy.\n\n144.\n\nThe benefits offered by the Contract to Malaysia were of a different nature to those offered in *CSOB*, *Jan de Nul* and *Bayindir*. The benefits flowing from the Contract were no different from the benefits flowing to the place of the performance of any normal service contract. The benefit was not lasting, in the sense envisaged in the public infrastructure or banking infrastructure projects. The submission that historical marine salvage contracts could lead to a thriving tourism industry appears speculative. In contrast, it is highly likely that a public infrastructure or banking infrastructure project such as those in *CSOB*, *Jan de Nul* and *Bayindir* could provide positive economic development to the host State.\n\n145.\n\nWhile the evidence adduced by the Claimant at the oral hearing referred to in Paragraphs 132-133 above was objected to by the Respondents on the ground of late introduction, the Tribunal has referred to it to show that, even on the Claimant's best case, it could not establish its claim to have made an \"investment.\" It has therefore not been necessary to call for any rebuttal evidence from the Respondent.\n\n**(d) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n146.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Contract is not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimant's claim therefore fails *in limine* and must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n\n**(vii) Discussion on the Meaning of \"Investment\" Within the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nAs stated at Paragraph 55 above, the Claimant must establish that the Contract:\n\na) falls within the definition of investment as provided under the BIT; and\n\nb) is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n148.\n\nHaving concluded that the Contract is not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is impelled to find that it lacks jurisdiction in the present case. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to discuss whether the Contract is an \"investment\" under the BIT.\n\n**V. OTHER ISSUES**\n-------------------\n\n149.\n\nIn view of the above findings, the Tribunal need not consider the other issues raised by the Respondent in support of its challenge to jurisdiction.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal has a discretion as to how the arbitration costs and the legal costs of the case are to be borne. The Tribunal is aware that, while it can order the losing party to pay all costs, it is common ICSID practice for each party to bear its own legal costs and for the arbitration costs to be divided equally regardless of the outcome of the arbitration. In this case, the dispute between the Parties has gone on for so long that the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate for it to be extended any longer. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to adopt the common ICSID practice described above.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n151.\n\nACCORDINGLY, THE TRIBUNAL DECLARES AND ORDERS as follows:\n\n(a) The Centre has no jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration and the Tribunal lacks competence to consider the claims made by the Claimant.\n\n(b) Each Party shall bear one half of the arbitration costs.\n\n(c) Each Party shall bear its own legal costs."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application for Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2009-04-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nI have signed the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in authentication of its decision. I nevertheless have the misfortune to be of a different opinion on the outcome. I have reflected on whether it is possible to support the decision and to express my thinking in the form of a separate opinion. But such is the importance of the issues as I see them that that course is not credible.\n\n2.\n\nRegretfully, I have to forego the company of my distinguished colleagues. The question which separates me from them is whether a contribution to the economic development of the host State is a condition of an ICSID \"investment.\" The Committee recalls the argument of the Applicant that it is not. The Committee's decision agrees with the Applicant's argument; I am of the opposite view.\n\n3.\n\nThere is a nuance to be noted. The Applicant accepts that international investment plays a role in the economic development of the host State but makes it clear that the playing of that role is not a condition of an ICSID investment. That may suggest that the Applicant is trying to have it both ways. In my opinion, the Applicant is to be acquitted of endeavouring to do so. The difference between the two propositions is small but definite. According to the Applicant (as I understand its case), the non-playing of a role in the economic development of the host State does not break a condition of an ICSID investment and so does not disentitle the investment to the protection of ICSID. And so the question remains whether a contribution to the economic development of the host State is a condition of an ICSID \"investment.\"\n\n4.\n\nMy main reasons for holding that economic development of the host State is a condition of an ICSID investment are these: *(a)*. However wide is the competence of parties to determine the terms of an investment, that competence is subject to some outer limits outside of their will, if only to measure the width of their competence within those limits. *(b)*. The outer limits in this case included a requirement that an investment must contribute to the economic development of the host State. *(c)*. The Tribunal was correct in finding that the contribution to the economic development of the host State had to be substantial or significant. *(d)*. The Tribunal was also correct in finding that the Applicant's outlay did not promote the economic development of Malaysia in a substantial or significant manner. *(e)*. It is a reversal of the logical process to begin the inquiry with a consideration of what is an investment under the 1981 Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Malaysia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\"). And, *(f)*, if the Tribunal erred in holding to these effects, it nevertheless did not manifestly exceed its powers.\n\n**A. HOWEVER WIDE IS THE COMPETENCE OF PARTIES TO DETERMINE THE TERMS OF AN INVESTMENT, THAT COMPETENCE IS SUBJECT TO SOME OUTER LIMITS OUTSIDE OF THEIR WILL, IF ONLY TO MEASURE THE WIDTH OF THEIR COMPETENCE WITHIN THOSE LIMITS.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nDuring the meetings which took place on the preparation of the ICSID Convention,1 the drafters omitted from the text a suggested minimum value to qualify as an investment. I have duly considered this but, for the following reasons, I am not persuaded that it means that it was agreed that there should be no outer limits to an ICSID investment or that jurisdiction depended on consent alone.\n\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, 14 October 1966.\n\n6.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the discussions during those preparatory meetings demonstrated that \"investment\" was not being defined;2 it was not desired to restrict the amplitude of the concept. There is indeed no stated definition of \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention; but is there no definition at all? It is agreed by the parties that Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties3 applies. On \"investment,\" what is the \"ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context4 and in the light of its object and purpose,\"5 within the meaning of that provision of the Vienna Convention?\n\n*See* International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States* (\"Report of the Executive Directors\"), para. 27: \"No attempt was made to define the term 'investment' given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4)).\"\n\n23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (\"Vienna Convention\").\n\nHowever it may be construed, the \"context,\" as stated in the Vienna Convention, cannot be entirely neutralised.\n\nVienna Convention, Article 31(1), footnote not in original.\n\n7.\n\nThe term \"investment\" bears some meaning: it is not meaningless. The Tribunal in *Pey Casado v. Chile* correctly held that \"there exist a definition of an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention..,.\"6 This is consistent with the Applicant's submission that it \"is not arguing that there is no objective meaning to the word 'investment' in Article 25(1)\"7 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, *Decision*, 25 September 2001 (\"*Pey Casado v. Chile*\"), para. 232, translation of the original text by the Committee Member.\n\nApplicant's Memorial, para. 62, footnote 70. The Applicant goes on to argue about the \"subjective approach,\" but this does not remove the effect of his earlier admission.\n\n8.\n\nIt is hard to think of an objective meaning of a term which is so amorphous as to be without any parameters. The discussions among delegates only signify that it was considered unwise to impose any rigidities on the coverage of the term within what Professor Christoph Schreuer correctly calls the \"outer limits\"8 of an investment. Logic requires the existence of some \"outer limits\"; this is the main reason for comparative silence on the matter in the *travaux*. This is also why the ICSID Tribunal in the recent *Rompetrol v. Romania* case observed that, \"as both Parties to this arbitration accept, Article 25 reflects objective 'outer limits' beyond which party consent would be ineffective.\"9 Parties are indeed free to agree on what constitutes an investment, but only within those \"outer limits\"; beyond those \"outer limits\" their consent is ineffectual to create an ICSID investment.\n\nCHRISTOPH SCHREUER, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY, p. 91 (2001).\n\n*The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 18 April 2008 (\"*Rompetrol v. Romania*\"), para. 80.\n\n9.\n\nIt is easy to appreciate why it is necessary to have \"outer limits\" of an investment. The contents of jurisdiction have to be distinguished from the limits within which those contents exist. The contents of the jurisdiction may be very broad; but whether they are broad or narrow can only be determined by reference to the boundaries within which they exist. The arguments of delegates to the ICSID conferences about definition of an investment have to be understood as relating to the contents of an investment, not to the ultimate limits within which an investment, however broad, has to exist.\n\n10.\n\nProfessor Schreuer has pointed out that the fact that definitions \"were not adopted was motivated less by the feeling that they were redundant than by an inability to agree on them.\"10 No doubt his statement focused on the contents of jurisdiction rather than on the outer limits within which they existed. But the intrinsic value of the statement will also apply to the outer limits.\n\nSCHREUER, *supra* note 8, p. 90.\n\n11.\n\nInability of delegates to agree on definitions does not mean that definitions were redundant, or that they do not exist; they encapsulate fundamental, if residual, ideas. Those ideas can be violated if the parties are free to decide that any outlay whatsoever is entitled to the protection given to an ICSID investment. Where it becomes necessary to find the outer limits, as it is here, they must be found - if necessary, by an implication that the parties accepted that their admittedly wide competence to agree on the contents of an ICSID investment assumed that that competence was nevertheless not limitless, that it was exercisable within some ultimate boundaries.\n\n12.\n\nThe position was accurately defined by the Chairman of the Regional Consultative Meetings of Legal Settlement of Investment Disputes when he reported on 9 July 1964 as follows:\n\nThe purpose of Section 1 is not to define the circumstances in which recourse to the facilities of the Center would in fact occur, but rather to indicate the outer limits within which the Center would have jurisdiction provided the parties' consent had been attained. Beyond these outer limits no use could be made of the facilities of the Center even with such consent.11\n\nICSID, HISTORY OF THE ICSID CONVENTION: DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE ORIGIN AND THE FORMULATION OF THE CONVENTION ON THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES BETWEEN STATES AND NATIONALS OF OTHER STATES (\"HISTORY OF THE ICSID CONVENTION\"), Volume II-1, p. 566 (1968).\n\n13.\n\nOf course there were other remarks in a wide ranging discussion, but I consider that the above represents the essential position, both in logic and in fact: there are outer limits of an ICSID investment which consent cannot breach.\n\n**B. THE OUTER LIMITS OF AN ICSID INVESTMENT COMPRISE A REQUIREMENT FOR CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMICDEVELOPMENT OF THE HOST STATE.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIf it is agreed that there are outer limits to an ICSID investment outside of the will of the parties, it is not arguable that those limits do not comprise a requirement for contribution to the economic development of the host State. The opposite argument stresses that such a requirement is not expressly laid down in the relevant texts, but many a thing which is not expressly stated is yet law if it can be worked out from the context. And the context does speak. In my view, it shows that the parties fell to be considered as having impliedly accepted that an ICSID investment must contribute to the economic development of the host State.\n\n15.\n\nThe annulment Committee in *Patrick Mitchell v. DRC* cited with approval the statement of Professor Schreuer in which he regarded a \"contribution to the economic development of the host State as '*the only possible indication of an objective meaning*' of the term 'investment.'\"12 The need for a contribution to the economic development of the host State is consistent with both the formative documents of ICSID and with case law.\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, 1 November 2006 (\"*Patrick Mitchell v. DRC*\"), para. 31.\n\n16.\n\nAs to the formative documents of ICSID, there is, first, the Preamble of the ICSID Convention. The Preamble states:\n\n**Considering** the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein;\n\n**Bearing in mind** the possibility that from time to time disputes may arise in connection with such investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States;\n\n17.\n\nThus, the purpose of the ICSID settlement mechanism was to resolve disputes which might arise in connection with \"such investment,\" that is to say, any \"investment\" concerning \"international cooperation for economic development.\" Did \"economic development\" contemplate economic development of entities divorced from the economic development of States? I think not. An ICSID investment might indeed be made in favour of private entities but not for their own enrichment exclusively: only on the basis that, though made in favour of private entities, such an investment would - not might -promote the economic development of the host State.\n\n18.\n\nThe fifth preambular paragraph of the ICSID Convention states: \"**Desiring** to establish such facilities under the auspices of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\" Development may indeed be widely construed, but its contents, however wide, must be capable of being regarded as contributing to the purpose of the development in view. Development of what? The reference to \"Reconstruction and Development\" leaves no reasonable doubt that it was the development of States which was being spoken of.\n\n19.\n\nThe Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention did indeed state that no attempt was made to define \"investment,\" but that statement was directed to the range of possible investments within a general field, not to the boundaries of the general field itself. The Report also states that \"[i]n submitting the attached Convention to governments, the Executive Directors are prompted by the desire to strengthen the partnership between countries in the cause of economic development.\"13 There is no logical ground for supposing that the economic development visualised was not the economic development of states: economic development of states was conceived of as the very rationale of the arrangements. This was recognized by the Tribunal in *Amco v. Indonesia* when it concluded: \"[t]hus, the Convention is aimed to protect, to the same extent and with the same vigour the investor and the host State, not forgetting that to protect investments is to protect the general interest of development and of developing countries.\"14\n\nReport of the Executive Directors, para. 9.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983 (\"*Amco v. Indonesia*\"). *See also id*., Award, 20 November 1984.\n\n20.\n\nThe influence of the IBRD over ICSID is illustrated by Article 2 of the ICSID Convention which provides that \"[t]he seat of the Centre shall be at the principal office of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\" The expenditure of the Centre is not a private matter; any excess in the expenditure which the Centre cannot meet \"out of charges for the use of its facilities, or out of other receipts... shall be borne by Contracting States which are members of the Bank in proportion to their respective subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank.\"15 Thus, states are to defray any operating deficits. Correspondingly, ICSID's \"assets, property and income, and its operations and transactions... shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties\";16 states are to forego these normal elements of their revenue.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 17. The full text of Article 17 provides: \"[i]f the expenditure of the Centre cannot be met out of charges for the use of its facilities, or out of other receipts, the excess shall be borne by Contracting States which are members of the Bank in proportion to their respective subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank, and by Contracting States which are not members of the Bank in accordance with rules adopted by the Administrative Council.\" *See also* ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, Regulation 18(1).\n\n*Id*, Article 24(1).\n\n21.\n\nA reasonable inference is that Contracting States did not agree that these burdens on them would apply to benefit transactions which did not promote the economic development of the host State. It is difficult to see how a purely commercial entity, intended only for the enrichment of its owners and not connected with the economic development of the host State, is entitled to bring before ICSID a dispute concerning an investment in the host State. Schreuer notes that \"it was always clear that ordinary commercial transactions would not be covered by the Centre's jurisdiction....\"17 It is pedantic to spend time on the meaning of \"ordinary commercial transactions.\"\n\nSCHREUER, *supra* note 8, p. 125.\n\n22.\n\nIn this connection, it is possible to conceive of an entity which is systematically earning its wealth at the expense of the development of the host State. However much that may collide with a prospect of development of the host State, it would not breach a condition - on the argument of the Applicant. Accordingly, such an entity would be entitled to claim the protection of ICSID. Host States which let in purely commercial enterprises would have something to worry about. Correspondingly, ICSID would seem to have lost its way: it is time to call back the organization to its original mission.\n\n23.\n\nEconomic development is referred to in the formative documents of ICSID - much more so than in the case of the opposite argument. One cannot behave as if these references did not appear in those documents, or seek to water them down by tedious argument. It is difficult to disagree with the remark of a student observer that \"[n]otwithstanding the aforementioned doctrine and case law, ICSID's Tribunals are currently following the stream towards minimizing the relevance of the development element, normally dismissing the Host State's objections to jurisdiction without giving to the existence of development the rank of a formal 'requisite.'\"18\n\nIgnacio D'Alessio, *A Comment on ICSID's Jurisdictional Issues*, University of Amsterdam, June 2008, p. 39, LL.M. paper. The consequences (as between traditional capital exporting countries and capital importing countries) are noticed in a short paper by Florian Grisel, *International Development and Investment Arbitration: Allies or Enemies* ? *LASIL, P**ERSPECTIVES* - 04/08.\n\n24.\n\nIf it is true that the host State's objections to jurisdiction on the basis that there is no economic development are \"normally\" dismissed, I can think of no defensible legal explanation.\n\n25.\n\nAs to case law, in *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* the Tribunal, referring to the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, said: \"[t]his language permits an inference that an international transaction which contributes to cooperation designed to promote the economic development of a Contracting State may be deemed to be an investment as that term is understood in the Convention.\"19\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999 (\"*CSOB v. Slovak Republic*\"), para. 64.\n\n26.\n\nThis was recalled by the Tribunal in the instant Award.20 The language is permissive, but it is permissive of an inference which, in my opinion, reflects a requirement that economic development of the host State is a condition of an ICSID investment. The same thing was pointed out in *Patrick Mitchell v. DRC*21, where the annulment Committee referred to three ICSID cases to the same effect. As the annulment Committee in this case recalled, in *Biwater v. Tanzania*22, the Tribunal interpreted the Criteria for an \"investment.\" But the Tribunal's interpretation did not relate to the question of the outer limits of an investment in the sense of a condition that an ICSID investment must contribute to the economic development of the host State. The question did not arise because the Applicant positively recognized a need to prove that its outlay promoted the economic development of the host State.23\n\n*See* *Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn., Bhd. v. The Government of Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Award on Jurisdiction, 17 May 2007 (\"Award\"), para. 66.\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. DRC*, para. 30. The case was criticised in Emmanuel Gaillard, *A Black Year: ICSID at Crossroads After Troubling Trend,* INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION LAW NEWS, NYLJ, 1 March 2007, p. 3. As recognised in the article, Mr. Gaillard represented Mr. Mitchell.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008 (\"*Biwater v. Tanzania*\"), paras. 233(e) - 240.\n\n*See id*.\n\n27.\n\nBy contrast, in *Pey Casado v. Chile*, the Tribunal said:\n\nThe requirement of a contribution to the development of the host State, which is difficult to establish, would pertain more to the merits of the dispute than to the Centre's jurisdiction. An investment may prove to be useful or not to a host State without losing his quality of investment. It is correct that the Preamble of the ICSID Convention evokes a contribution to the economic development of the host State. This reference is however presented as a consequence, not as a condition of the investment: in protecting the investments, the Convention promotes the development of the host state. This does not mean that the development of the host State is a constitutive element of the notion of investment. This is the reason why, as noted by some arbitral tribunals, this fourth condition is in fact encompassed by the three others.24\n\n*Pey Casado v. Chile*, para. 232, translation of the original text by the Committee Member.\n\n28.\n\nElegantly put, but, with respect, not convincing. It is not merely that the \"[p]reamble of the ICSID Convention evokes a contribution to the economic development of the host State\"25; the preamble reflects an inference that the very purpose of an ICSID investment is to contribute to the economic development of the host State. It is indeed the case that an \"investment may prove to be useful or not to a host State without losing the quality of investment,\" but that subsequent contingency has nothing to do with the question whether the investment, in its origins, has to be for the purpose of the economic development of the host State; this question has to be answered at the time when the investment is made.\n\n*Id*., translation of the original text by the Committee Member.\n\n29.\n\nBuilding on the language used in *Pey Casado v. Chile*, the Applicant submits that the \"Preamble's statement should therefore be more properly read as merely reflecting the fact that international investment plays a role in economic development, and not, as the Tribunal concluded, that contribution to economic development is a *condition* for an activity to be considered an 'investment.'\"26 In my opinion, it is not merely that \"international investment plays a role in economic development\" of the host State: international investment must play a role in the economic development of the host State if the investment is to rank as an ICSID investment and be entitled to the protection of the ICSID settlement procedures; that requirement is a condition of an ICSID investment.\n\nApplicant's Reply, para. 20.\n\n30.\n\nUndoubtedly there are statements in the *travaux* which indicate that economic development of the host State was visualized but not as a condition of an investment. I have cited above a statement by Professor Schreuer in which he regarded a contribution to the economic development of the host State as \"the only possible indication of an objective meaning' of the term 'investment.'\"27 I can only understand this as a recognition that economic development of the host State is a condition of an ICSID investment. If it is not, there is nothing to separate an ICSID investment from any other kind of investment; in the result, an ICSID arbitration would be indistinguishable from any other kind of arbitration (and there are several) concerning an investment dispute.\n\nSCHREUER, *supra* note 8; *see also* discussion at para. 15 above.\n\n31.\n\nConcrete or imaginable ICSID cases may appear to lack the power to contribute to the economic development of the host State, *e.g.*, cases concerned with the dissemination of cultural ideas or with the improvement of the legal structure. Do such cases suggest that economic development was being set aside? Or, do they indicate that a broad view was being taken of the scope of economic development? I prefer to think that the latter represents the true position. The annulment Committee in *Patrick Mitchell v. DRC* observed pertinently that \"the concept of investment was somewhat 'broadened\"'28 in some cases, but it added that \"this does nothing to alter the fundamental nature of that characteristic.\"29 The fundamental nature of the requirement to prove that an ICSID investment is for the economic development of the host State stands.\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. DRC*, para.30.\n\n*Id*.\n\n32.\n\nThe effect of reasoning opposed to that advanced above is that, if it happens that an investment does not play a role in the economic development of the host State, that investment is nonetheless fully entitled to claim the protection of ICSID if it meets dictionary criteria of what is an investment. That is strange: one would have thought that an ICSID investment was a special kind of investment. A microscopic approach could no doubt reach a different result, but such a result would be at variance with the discernible motivation of the ICSID scheme which, in my opinion, was designed to contribute to the economic development of host States. That purpose is not satisfactorily put by merely stating that an ICSID investment plays a role in the economic development of the host State; it has to be stated that such development is a condition of an ICSID investment.\n\n**C. A CONTRIBUTION TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOST STATE HAS TO BE \"SUBSTANTIAL\" OR \"SIGNIFICANT.\"**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal found that contribution to the economic development of the host State has to be \"substantial\" or \"significant.\" Nothing in the texts says so, and the Applicant challenges the proposition. I understand the Applicant to contend that economic development of the host State is not required but that, if it is, some contribution, however small, is enough. The Respondent supports the contrary position taken by the Tribunal. Which position is correct?\n\n34.\n\nAs recalled above, Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention enjoins a search for the \"ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" Whatever the strict sequence of the statutory steps, the search for the \"ordinary meaning\" of \"investment\" sooner or later throws the searcher back on the understanding of the international legal community. The international legal community would have rejected out of hand the idea that any contribution to the economic development of the host State, however miniscule that contribution is, is sufficient to qualify the whole outlay as an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. I am confident that the common understanding would have preferred the notion of a \"substantial\" or \"significant\" contribution, as the Tribunal did.\n\n35.\n\nThere is no basis for contending that the general understanding supports the opposite principle that effect has to be given even to minor but negligible matters - unless such a reading is required by the text. There is nothing to that effect in the governing text; Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not indicate the improbability of a very tiny contribution to economic development being sufficient to qualify the whole outlay as an ICSID investment. In my opinion, the concept of *de minimis* is a familiar and universal principle; it applies generally - barring a provision to the contrary.\n\n36.\n\nThere is some dispute about whether this is the law. The way to look at it is in the reverse. Is it the law that an infinitesimally small development suffices to convert the whole outlay into an ICSID investment which is designed to foster the economic development of the host State? I have no doubt that the law is not to that effect. The governing principle is good faith. *Ex re sed non ex nomine* has been appealed to. So too have the concepts of proportionality and abuse of rights.30 A precise statement on the position cannot be located, but applicable guiding principles are not wanting.\n\n*See generally* BIN CHENG, GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AS APPLIED BY INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, pp. 122,133 (1987).\n\n37.\n\nDecisions favouring the view that a contribution to economic development has to be substantial or significant are to be found in *Joy Mining v. Egypt;31 L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA**v. Algeria*32; and *Bayindir v. Pakistan*33.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004 (\"*Joy Mining v. Egypt*\"), paras. 49, 53.\n\n*Consortium Groupement L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/8, Award, 10 January 2005, (\"*L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA v. Algeria*\"), Section II, para. 14(i) - (ii).\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005 (\"*Bayindir v. Pakistan*\"), para. 137. See also *Franz Volk v. S.P.R.L. Ets J. Vervaecke*, 9 July 1969, 1969 European Court 00295, holding, on a question whether a trade agreement is capable of affecting trade contrary to a certain prohibition, that \"regard must be had to the proportion of the market which the grantor controls or endeavours to obtain\" and that \"an agreement falls outside the prohibition... when it has only an insignificant effect on the markets.\" And see the review in Maija Laurila, The *de minimis* Doctrine in EEC Competition Law: Agreements of Minor Importance, E.C.L.R. 1993, 14(3), 97-104.\n\n38.\n\nObviously, there must come a point where the contribution to economic development is so marginal that the Tribunal is competent to disregard it on the safe assumption that the law is speaking only of a substantial contribution. Pronouncements to the contrary would be difficult to appreciate; they would overlook the circumstance that no specific statutory mandate is required to enable a judicial body to understand the concept of a contribution as meaning a substantial contribution, absent any contrary indication in the governing text. In paragraph 123 of the Award, the Tribunal correctly observed, \"Were there not the requirement of significance, any contract which enhances the Gross Domestic Product of an economy by any amount, however small, would qualify as an 'investment.'\"\n\n**D. THE APPLICANT'S OUTLAY DID NOT PROMOTE THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF MALAYSIA IN A SUBSTANTIAL ORSIGNIFICANT MANNER.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal was entitled to find that the Claimant's outlay did not promote the economic development of Malaysia in the sense that it did not substantially or significantly contribute to it. The Committee cannot reverse that finding without assuming the forbidden functions of a court of appeal.\n\n**E. THE BIT DID NOT HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED.**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Applicant objected that the Tribunal failed to consider whether the Contract was an investment under the BIT. Under the BIT, \"investment\" was expressly defined by the United Kingdom and Malaysia to be extremely broad - encompassing \"every kind of asset.\" I understand the Applicant's suggestion to be that an investment within this broad definition governs the scope of an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention regardless of whether the investment falls within any outer limits of an investment and in particular meets a condition that it contributes to the economic development of the host State.\n\n41.\n\nIncidentally, nothing brings out so much as this argument that the Applicant's real contention is that the consent of the parties is enough, by itself, to clothe the Tribunal with jurisdiction. In my view, that contention is mistaken.\n\n42.\n\nThe question is and remains whether an outlay is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The reference to an \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not made subject to any definition in another instrument. The ICSID provision is controlling. It is therefore logical to begin with the question whether the Applicant's outlay is an investment within the meaning of that provision.\n\n43.\n\nAs has been argued, the answer turns on whether the Applicant's outlay is within the outer limits of an investment and, in particular, on whether it meets a condition for contribution to the economic development of the host State. These limitations are inapplicable to an investment under the BIT since this extends to \"every kind of asset\" that the parties may agree on. In effect, under the BIT the parties are free to choose whatever they desire to be regarded as an investment; that unanchored fluctuation in the nature of an investment gives no weight to the formative documents of ICSID.\n\n44.\n\nIn *Joy Mining v. Egypt*, the Tribunal noted: \"[t]he fact that the Convention has not defined the term investment does not mean, however, that anything consented to by the parties might qualify as an investment under the Convention.\"34 And Professor Schreuer writes:\n\nThe fact that most of the proposed definitions for the objective criteria for jurisdiction were not adopted was motivated less by the feeling that they were redundant than by an inability to agree on them. It would be inaccurate to assume that the general phrasing of these objective criteria in Art. 25 gives the parties complete freedom to determine, by the terms of their consent, which disputes they wish to submit to the Centre. This fact is borne out by the Report of the Executive Directors:\n\nWhile consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.\n\nConsequently, it is necessary to take a closer look at the meaning of the objective jurisdictional requirements set out in Art. 25. The interpretation by the parties of these objective requirements is given great weight. Nevertheless, there are outer limits to the Centre's jurisdiction that are not subject to the parties' disposition. This conclusion is borne out by Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules and Rule 29 of the Conciliation Rules of 1984: a conciliation commission or an arbitral tribunal will not only take note of an objection to jurisdiction filed by a party but may also consider on its own initiative whether the dispute before it is within the Centre's jurisdiction (citations omitted).35\n\n*Joy Mining v. Egypt*, para. 49.\n\nSCHREUER, *supra* note 8, pp. 90 - 91.\n\n45.\n\nThe two provisions last cited in the excerpt from Schreuer empower an arbitral tribunal (or a conciliation commission) to raise \"on its own initiative\" a jurisdictional question, even though other provisions empower a party to raise jurisdictional questions. An objection to jurisdiction may be raised by a tribunal even if the parties consent to jurisdiction and do not question it. Jurisdiction is not entirely left to the will of parties. Therefore, to start with the consent of the parties (as if that is self-sufficient) inverts the logical process.\n\n46.\n\nAs was observed by the annulment Committee in *Patrick Mitchell v. DRC* :\n\n[T]he parties to an agreement and the States which conclude an investment treaty cannot open the jurisdiction of the Centre to any operation they might arbitrarily qualify as an investment. It is thus repeated that, before ICSID arbitral tribunals, the Washington Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties or a BIT.36\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. DRC*, para. 31.\n\n47.\n\nTo return to *Joy Mining v. Egypt*, the Tribunal in that case said:\n\nThe parties to a dispute cannot by contract or treaty define as investment, for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction, something which does not satisfy the objective requirements of Article 25 of the Convention. Otherwise Article 25 and its reliance on the concept of investment, even if not specifically defined, would be turned into a meaningless provision.37\n\n*Joy Mining v. Egypt*, para. 50.\n\n**F. EVEN IF THE TRIBUNAL ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE APPLICANT'S OUTLAY WAS NOT AN ICSID INVESTMENT, THE TRIBUNAL DID NOT MANIFESTLY EXCEED ITS POWERS.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal found that the Centre had no jurisdiction. It held that it was a condition of an ICSID investment that the investment must contribute to the economic development of the host State, and that indeed it must do so substantially or significantly; in its view, the Claimant's outlay did not contribute to the economic development of Malaysia and, if it did, did not do so substantially or significantly.\n\n49.\n\nChallenging this holding, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal \"has manifestly exceeded its powers\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which sets out an exhaustive list of grounds for the annulment of an award. Assuming, but not finding, that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in concluding that the Claimant's outlay was not an ICSID investment, did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention?\n\n50.\n\nAs recalled in the Committee's decision, the Applicant contended that, under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal does not have to find that there was an excess of powers and then go on to find that the excess was manifest; the Tribunal was required to answer a single question: Was there a manifest excess of powers?\n\n51.\n\nI am not sure what turns on the point, but, at any rate, it appears to me that all it does is to conceal an analysis which shows a clear distinction between there being an excess of powers and a manifest excess of powers. The law obviously contemplates that not all and every case of excess of powers will lead to annulment; that result will only come about if there is both an excess of powers and an excess of powers which is manifest. The reverse will only be true if it were the case that every excess of jurisdiction is a manifest excess of jurisdiction. But, for reasons which need not be rehearsed, that is not true.38\n\n*See* *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on the Application for the Annulment of the Award, 5 June 2007 (\"*Soufraki v. UAE*\"), para. 118: \"[t]he *ad hoc* Committee sees no reason why the rule that an excess of power must be manifest in order to be annullable should be disregarded when the question under discussion is a jurisdictional one.\" *See also* the *ad hoc* Committee's ruling in\u00a0*Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Peru, S.A. (formerly Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A.) v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Decision on Annulment, 5 September 2007 (\"*Lucchetti v. Peru*\"), para. 101.\n\n52.\n\nThis is an arbitral process; a high threshold is required to show that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. A manifest excess of powers is an excess of powers that is easily perceived or discerned by the mind, without the need for deeper analysis.39 The annulment Committee in *Wena Hotels v. Egypt* adopts this approach when it states, \"[t]he excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"40\n\n*See* SCHREUER, *supra* note 8, p. 934.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Application for Annulment, 5 February 2002 (\"*Wena Hotels v. Egypt*\"), para. 25; *see also Repsol v. Ecuador*, *infra* note 44.\n\n53.\n\nThat position recalls the restricted circumstances in which a state is entitled to refuse recognition to an arbitral award given in a dispute with another state. What the ICSID Convention has in substance done is to institutionalize that principle in relation to parties to an ICSID arbitration, including the concept of there having to be a \"manifest\" breach of competence before there can be judicial intervention.41 Thus, the jurisprudence does distinguish between a breach of competence and a 'manifest' breach of competence.\n\nSee the position as it later came to be set out in *Arbitral Award of 31 July 1989, ICJ Reports 1991*, 53, at paras. 47, 56, 60.\n\n54.\n\nPlainly, then, the Committee is not empowered to intervene if all that it finds is that the Tribunal exceeded its powers; it must go on to find that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, a manifest error not being necessarily the same thing as a manifest excess of powers, there being an obvious distinction between them. An annulment committee is not a court of appeal. The Award is unimpeachable if all it does is to exceed the Tribunal's powers.\n\n55.\n\nThe object of the requirement that the Committee can only act if the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers is to maintain the integrity of the arbitral process. If there was a manifest excess of powers (including a jurisdictional excess), the Committee can intervene. But I do not think that that threshold can be passed in this case without converting the limited grounds of annulment into the ampler grounds of an appeal. Considerations of finality showed that the Tribunal was entitled to err within its boundaries even if it exceeded its powers - provided that the error was not manifest.\n\n56.\n\nOf course there can be argument that a mistaken interpretation of a law means that the law is not being applied, the proposition being that failure to exercise a jurisdiction which exists is a manifest excess of powers. The answer suggested by the jurisprudence is this: if the Committee finds that the Tribunal applied the law, a misinterpretation of the law does not matter. The result would be different if the mistake led the Tribunal not to apply the law, it being assumed that the law was decisive. The position was encapsulated by the annulment Committee in *MTD v. Chile*, reading:\n\nAn award will not escape annulment if the tribunal while purporting to apply the relevant law actually applies another, quite different law. But in such a case the error must be 'manifest,' not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough (citation omitted).42\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Chile*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment, 21 March 2007 (\"*MTD v. Chile*\"), para. 47.\n\n57.\n\nIn *Repsol v. Ecuador*, the annulment Committee cited with approval Professor Schreuer's statement to the effect that \"[*a*]*n excess of powers is manifest if it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis*.\"43 It held that, in that case, the law had been applied even if it was misinterpreted. In effect, it preferred the cognitive to the analytical approach. In *CMS v. Argentine Republic*,44 the annulment Committee found that the Tribunal had misinterpreted a provision of the applicable law but had nevertheless applied it, though \"cryptically and defectively.\"45 It held that there was \"no manifest excess of powers.\"46\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v.

In paragraph 130, the annulment Committee found that \"the Tribunal made a manifest error of law,\" but it obviously did not consider that this was the same thing as saying that the Tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n58.\n\nThere are of course various ways of putting the position, but that which seems most in keeping with common sense was set out some years ago by the annulment Committee sitting in *Amco v. Indonesia*. It said:\n\nThe law applied by the Tribunal will be examined by the ad hoc Committee, not for the purpose of scrutinizing whether the Tribunal committed errors in the interpretation of the requirements of applicable law or in the ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which such law has been applied. Such scrutiny is properly the task of a court of appeals, which the ad hoc Committee is not. The ad hoc Committee will limit itself to determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law, would constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. The ad hoc Committee has approached this task with caution, distinguishing failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment and misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal.47\n\n*Amco v. Indonesia*, para. 22.\n\n59.\n\nQuestions of judgment are obviously involved in determining whether the Contract in this case was an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; the matter turns largely on facts. Take the Tribunal's concession (much emphasized by the Applicant and apparently also by the Committee) that to some extent the Applicant did contribute to the economic development of Malaysia. The Tribunal proceeded to disregard the contribution as not being substantial or significant. It was probably applying the principle that (unless the contrary is indicated in the governing texts) the law disregards very minor matters. Cases on the point have been cited above.\n\n60.\n\nOn the principle of substantiality, who is to say that the Tribunal was manifestly in excess of its powers either in adopting that principle or in applying it? The question is not whether the Tribunal's interpretation is expressly articulated in the formal texts but whether it is inconsistent therewith or with the context. I am not persuaded that there is any inconsistency in this case.\n\n61.\n\nI agree that the Arbitral Tribunal would have manifestly exceeded its powers if the Applicant is correct in arguing that the Tribunal should have considered the BIT definition of \"investment,\"48 but, for the reasons given, it appears to me that to begin the inquiry with the BIT is to stand the analysis on its head.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, p. 7, footnote 32.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n--------------\n\n62.\n\nWhat this case hinges on is a perception of the objectives of ICSID: Was the jurisdiction of ICSID meant to be solely dependent on the will of the parties? Or, was it meant to be dependent on the will of the parties subject to conformity with the overriding objectives of ICSID as a body concerned with the economic development of the host State? The former may be referred to as the 'subjectivist' view, the latter as the 'objectivist' view. The cleavage marks a titanic struggle between ideas, and correspondingly between capital exporting countries and capital importing ones.49\n\nThe fact that some traditional capital importing countries are now, to an extent, capital exporting ones is scarcely relevant. On this phenomenon, see Florian Grisel, *International Development and Investment Arbitration: Allies or Enemies?* LASIL, PERSPECTIVES *,* April 2008.\n\n63.\n\nThis opinion is based on the objectivist view. But, as today's decision demonstrates, the subjectivist view is probably in the ascendant; if it continues to prosper, I see no answer to the observation that, by \"promoting an extension of ICSID jurisdiction to any kind of economic operation, even those without any connection to 'authentic' investment... ICSID may well become just another arbitration institution, competing with a range of others (ICC, LCIA, AISCC, etc.).\"50\n\nFarouk Yala, *The Notion of 'Investment' in ICSID Case Law: A Drifting Jurisdictional Requirement?* JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION 22(2) (2005), 105-126, at 125.\n\n64.\n\nThe formative instruments of ICSID do not justify the view that ICSID was meant to be just another arbitration institution. The reasons for the change in direction are not to be found in any known legal rationale. The change is not compatible with the original objectives of the institution. On the available material, there is no question of the Washington Convention having been impliedly amended by a practice of accommodating so fundamental a departure. Besides, there has been no argument about an implied amendment of the Convention.\n\n65.\n\nThese considerations lead me to support the view of the Tribunal that there could only be an ICSID investment if the investment was intended to promote the economic development of the host State, and that indeed that economic development had to be substantial or significant. The Tribunal was right in its holdings; alternatively, if there was error, the error did not lead it into a manifest excess of its powers. No doubt, the opposite view is strongly supported in the literature51 and I am aware of the Committee's preference for it, but, with respect, I do not consider that it is ironclad.\n\n*See, e.g.*, the interesting article by Yulia Andreeva, *Salvaging or Sinking the Investment? MHS v. Malaysia Revisited*, THE LAW AND PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, 7 (2008) 161175."}], "Content": "Decision on the Application for Annulment\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nThe question in this case is whether the Award on Jurisdiction of 17 May 2007 in *Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia1* should be annulled on the sole ground invoked by Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn., Bhd. (the \"Applicant\" or the \"Salvor\"), namely, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to exercise a jurisdiction over the dispute with which it was endowed under the Convention on the Settlement of International Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States2 (the \"ICSID Convention\") and by the terms of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Malaysia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"Agreement\" or \"BIT\"). A particular question under the ICSID Convention is whether the resources spent by a company that contracted with the Government of Malaysia to salvage a shipwreck constitute an investment in that State within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Monetarily, the case is a small one, but, as will be seen, it involves larger issues.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn., Bhd. v. The Government of Malaysia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Award on Jurisdiction, May 17, 2007 (\"Award\").\n\n14 October 1966.\n\n2.\n\nThe matter arises in this way. In 1817, a British vessel named the *Diana* sank in waters which now form part of the territorial waters of Malaysia. It was carrying a large cargo of antique Chinese porcelain. The Applicant is a marine salvage company incorporated under the laws of Malaysia, the majority of whose shares are owned by a British national (whether that was the case when the dispute arose is in dispute). Under a contract dated 3 August 19913 (the \"Contract\"), the Applicant and the Government of Malaysia (the \"Respondent\") agreed that the Applicant would find the wreck and salvage the cargo of the *Diana* for the Respondent. The Applicant by the title and provision of the Contract agreed \"to survey, identify, classify, research, restore, preserve, appraise, market, sell/auction and carry out a scientific survey and salvage of the wreck and contents... believed to be the Wreck \u2018DIANA.\u2019\"4 The Contract provides that the foregoing \"[w]orks is for the sole purpose of archeological interest and the study of historical heritage.\"5 The Government and the Salvor \"shall have ownerships of publication and intellectual rights.... However the GOVERNMENT shall not commercially exploit such rights except in so far as to propagate education, tourism, museums, culture and history.\"6 The Salvor \"shall ensure that at least 50% from its total personnel comprise Malaysian personnel for the purpose of carrying out the Works.\"7\n\nContract No. IPL3/1991 dated 3 August 1991 between the Government of Malaysia and Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn., Bhd. (with Variation Order No. 1/1993 dated 12 April 1993 and Extension of Contract dated 12 July 1994) (\"Contract\").\n\nContract, Preamble.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* Clause 15.1.\n\n*Id,* Clause 26.1.\n\n3.\n\nThe Contract was on a \"\u2018No Finds No Pay\u2019 basis,\"8 a well established practice in marine salvage, which meant that all the costs of the search and salvage operation and its risks would be borne by the Applicant but the finds (if any) would belong to the Respondent, against payment by the Respondent to the Applicant of a portion of the value of any finds.\n\n*Id.,* Clause 2.2.\n\n4.\n\nAccordingly, title to the recovered cargo was to belong to the Respondent. Out of the value of the recovered cargo, a \"Service Fee\" was to be paid by the Respondent to the Applicant, in accordance with a formula set out in the Contract.9 Under a subsequent contract,10 the Applicant was to arrange for the auction of the recovered items in Europe by the international auction firm, Christie\u2019s. The Respondent reserved the right to withdraw salvaged items from the sale \"which are of interest to the National Museum for study and exhibition\"11 provided that the Applicant was paid its share of the best attainable value for these withdrawn items. The Applicant was then entitled to the \"Service Fee\" comprising 70% of the combined total of the proceeds from auction plus the appraised value of those items not auctioned.12\n\n*See id.,* Clause 4\n\nAgreement No. PERB/PK/116/1994 dated 22 September 1994 between the Government of Malaysia, Malaysian Historical Salvors and Christie\u2019s Amsterdam B.V. (\"Agreement 116/1994\").\n\n*Id.,* Clause 2.2.\n\nContract, Clause 4.1.1.\n\n5.\n\nAfter an extended search and salvage operation of almost four years, the Applicant found the wreck and recovered approximately 24,000 pieces of porcelain from it. Some items were withheld from sale by the Respondent; the remainder were auctioned in March 1995 at Christie\u2019s in Amsterdam for approximately USD 2.98 million. A number of pieces of antique Chinese porcelain so salvaged have been placed in the Malaysian National Museum.\n\n6.\n\nThe Applicant in the original arbitration proceeding alleged that, while being contractually entitled to 70% of the amount realised from Christie\u2019s auction, it received only USD 1.2 million, or 40% of the amount realised. The Applicant also alleged that the Respondent withheld from sale salvaged items valued at over USD 400,000 and did not pay the Applicant its share of the best attainable value of these items.\n\n7.\n\nOn 30 September 2004, the Applicant submitted a request for arbitration to ICSID, invoking the consent to ICSID arbitration contained in the Agreement. On 17 May 2007, the Tribunal\u2019s Award dismissing the Applicant\u2019s claims in their entirety for want of jurisdiction was dispatched to the parties.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal consisted of Mr. Michael Hwang, S.C., as the Sole Arbitrator. It is the Award rendered by that distinguished arbitrator which is the subject of this annulment proceeding. It may be noted that the ICSID Secretariat, in exercise of its screening function, put a number of questions to the Applicant, and received its replies, before registering the Request as supplemented by those replies.13\n\n*See* Award, paras. 18 - 25.\n\n9.\n\nThe Applicant argued that its performance under the Contract fell within the meaning of \"investment\" as defined under the Agreement,14 and that the Respondent violated Article 2 (Protection of Investment), Article 4 (Expropriation), Article 5 (Repatriation of Investment) and Article 7 (Consent to ICSID arbitration) of the Agreement. Whether the Agreement applied was not determined by the Tribunal because the Respondent objected to the proceedings on the ground that ICSID had no jurisdiction over the dispute under the ICSID Convention, which, in the event, was the sole question addressed by the Sole Arbitrator.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT provides, in part: \"[f|or the purposes of the Agreement, (1)(a) \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:... (iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract, having a financial value;... (v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.\"\n\n**B. THE AWARD**\n----------------\n\n10.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Sole Arbitrator requested counsel to comment on several ICSID cases which had not been discussed by the parties in their earlier submissions but which he identified as being of interest for the matter under his consideration. On 17 May 2007, the Tribunal rendered its Award on Jurisdiction (the \"Award\"). The Tribunal concluded that the Centre had no jurisdiction over the dispute submitted, and that the Tribunal lacked the competence to consider the claims made by the Applicant.15\n\nAward, para. 151\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that ICSID jurisprudence, cited by the parties, requires the adoption of a two-stage approach to determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over a dispute. The Applicant must show that the Contract is an \"investment\" within the meaning Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention;16 if it succeeds in showing that, it must then go on to show that the Contract also falls within the definition of an \u2018investment\u2019 as set out in the relevant bilateral investment treaty.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State...) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal initially turned to the question whether the Contract was an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Applicant had argued that the Contract was the quintessence of an \"investment\" because the Applicant had invested its own funds and other financial resources (\"outlay\") in the performance of the Contract, and also assumed the risk for the failure of the salvage operation. The Applicant had also argued that its performance under the Contract had the hallmarks of \"investment\" identified in previous ICSID cases,17 and relied on *Alcoa Minerals v. Jamaica18* in which the Tribunal recognised that contribution of capital was one type of investment.\n\nThe Applicant relied on *Salini Costruttori S.p.A, and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, an English translation of which is found at 6 ICSID Reports 400 (2004), (\"*Salini v. Morocco\");* *Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11, Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004 (\"*Joy Mining v.

Jamaica\").*\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent argued in response that the Contract was not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention, as the Contract was \"for the sole purpose of archaeological interest and the study of historical heritage.\"19 The Respondent submitted that the Applicant\u2019s case did not meet the requirements of \"investment\" as set out in the *Salini v. Morocco* case,20 and that the Contract had not contributed to the economic development of Malaysia.\n\nContract, Preamble.\n\n*See* Award, para. 47.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal started its discussion of the meaning of the term \"investment\" by recalling that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties21 (the \"Vienna Convention\") provides that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted... in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms....\" The Tribunal also considered that, taking \"a teleological approach\" to the ICSID Convention, a tribunal ought to interpret the word \"investment\" so as to encourage, facilitate and promote cross-border economic cooperation and development. It held that support for this approach could be found, *inter alia,* in the Preamble to the ICSID Convention which speaks of **\"[c]onsidering** the need for international cooperation for economic development....\"\n\n23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that there were seven decided cases \"of importance\" on the issue whether a contract is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention, and that, while \"there is no doctrine of *stare decisis* in ICSID jurisprudence,\"22 a review of these cases would \"assist in determining\"23 the issue at hand. The Tribunal noted that the language of these cases could be interpreted as defining features as typical characteristics on the one hand (the \"Typical Characteristics Approach\") or as jurisdictional requirements on the other (the \"Jurisdictional Approach\"). While the Jurisdictional Approach requires that each of the established hallmarks of an \"investment\" must be present before a contract can be considered an \"investment,\" the Typical Characteristics Approach would still allow a tribunal to find that there is an \"investment,\" even if one or more of the established hallmarks were missing.24\n\nAward, para. 56.\n\n*Id.* The seven cases \"of importance\" were *Salini v. Morocco', Joy Mining v. Egypt', L.E.S.I.-DIPENTA v. Algeria',* *Jan de Nul NV and Dredging International NV v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 June 2006 (\" *Jan de Nul v. Egypt\");* *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005 (\" *Bayindir v. Pakistan\"); Ceskoslovensk\u00e2 obchodni banka, a.s. v.

DRC).*\n\nAward, para. 70.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal then reviewed the seven cases of importance \"to discern a broad trend which emerges from ICSID jurisprudence on the \u2018investment\u2019 requirement....\"25 The Tribunal noted that jurisprudence on the meaning of \"investment\" typically cites *Salini v. Morocco26* and *Joy Mining v. Egypt27* as authorities for the various defining hallmarks of an \"investment,\" and that the factors considered in *Salini v. Morocco* are widely accepted as a starting point of an ICSID Tribunal\u2019s analysis on this point. The Tribunal then cited the *Salini v. Morocco* factors, being: \"contributions, a certain duration of performance of the contract and a participation in the risks of the transaction... In reading the Convention\u2019s Preamble, one may add the contribution to the economic development of the host State of the investment as an additional condition.\"28\n\n*Id.,* para. 104.\n\n*See* *Salini v. Morocco,* paras. 50 - 58.\n\n*See* *Joy Mining v. Egypt,* paras. 42-63.\n\nAward, para. 78\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded from its review of the seven cases that the differences between the two approaches are likely to be academic, and in the practice it is unlikely that any difference in juristic analysis would make any significant difference to the ultimate findings of the tribunal. The Tribunal noted that ICSID tribunals tend to adopt \"an empirical rather than a doctrinaire approach\"29 to determining whether there is an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and summarised the jurisprudence thus:\n\n(a) Where the facts are strongly in favour of a finding in each of the relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment,\u2019 a tribunal can confirm its jurisdiction in strong terms emphasizing that the requirements of \u2018investment\u2019 are clearly fulfilled (citation omitted).\n\n(b) Where the facts clearly show that one or more of the relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment\u2019 are missing, a tribunal may uphold the jurisdictional challenge of a respondent in strong terms by using language in support of a Jurisdictional Approach in order to demonstrate more clearly why the tribunal is rejecting jurisdiction (citation omitted).\n\n(c) Where the facts are not as clear-cut as in the scenarios envisaged in a) and b) above, a tribunal will have to consider whether there is any evidence in support of each of the relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment.\u2019 Where there is some marginal evidence in support of one of the relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment,\u2019 but more conclusive evidence in support (sic) the presence of the other relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment,\u2019 the tribunal may choose to discount the weakness of the claimant\u2019s case in one of the relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment\u2019 by stating that the issue of \u2018investment\u2019 should be approached on a holistic basis.... In this situation, a tribunal is likely to use language that may be interpreted as advocating a Typical Characteristics Approach (citation omitted).\n\n(d) Alternatively, in the scenario discussed in c), a tribunal may also rely on a Jurisdictional Approach but, in examining whether each of the relevant hallmarks of \u2018investment\u2019 is satisfied, the tribunal may take a broad approach, requiring only relatively marginal evidence to establish a positive finding in favour of assuming ICSID jurisdiction.... In other words, the hallmarks, although essential, are not sufficient to ensure that a contract is an \u2018investment\u2019 (citation omitted).\n\n(e) The classical *Salini* hallmarks are not a punch list of items which, if completely checked off, will automatically lead to a conclusion that there is an \u2018investment.\u2019 If any of these hallmarks are absent, the tribunal will hesitate (and probably decline) to make a finding of \u2018investment.\u2019 However, even if they are all present, a tribunal will still examine the nature and degree of their presence in order to determine whether, on a holistic assessment, it is satisfied that there is an ICSID \u2018investment.\u201930\n\n*Id.,* para. 106.\n\nAward, para. 106.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered to what degree the hallmarks of \"investment\" had been met in the present case, \"adopting a fact-specific and holistic assessment.\"31 As to the first hallmark, \"Regularity of Profits and Returns\" (which the Tribunal noted was cited in *Joy Mining v. Egypt,* but not in *Salini v. Morocco),* the Tribunal held that there was no regularity of profits or returns in the present case. However, it accepted the Applicant\u2019s argument that that criterion is not always decisive and has not been held to be an essential characteristic in any of the cited cases.32\n\n*Id.,* para. 107.\n\n*Id.,* para. 108.\n\n19.\n\nRegarding the second hallmark, \"Contributions,\" the Tribunal held that it was not in dispute that the Applicant expended its own funds, but \"the size of the contributions were in no way comparable to those found in *Salini, Bayindir* and *Jan de Nul* or even in *Joy Mining.'\"33*\n\n*Id.,* para. 109.\n\n20.\n\nAs to the third hallmark, \"Duration of the Contract,\" the Tribunal noted that the \"Contract took almost four years to complete,\"34 and therefore complied with the minimum length of time discussed in *Salini v. Morocco.* However, due to the nature of the Contract, the Tribunal held that the Applicant only satisfied this factor in a quantitative sense, but failed to do so in the qualitative sense, given that (a) the time expended in performance of the Contract was dependent, in part, on the element of fortuity (this appears to be a reference to the difficulty in finding the wreck); (b) the Contract did not appear to be a contract that would promote the economy and development of the host State \"as the criterion of duration is not satisfied in the qualitative sense envisaged by ICSID jurisprudence.\"35\n\n*Id.,* para. 110.\n\nAward., para. 111.\n\n21.\n\nAs to the fourth hallmark, \"Risks Assumed Under the Contract,\" the Tribunal noted that it was not disputed that all the risks of the Contract were borne by the Applicant. However, the Tribunal concluded that the fact that salvage contracts are typically on a \"no-finds-no-pay\" basis was evidence that the risks assumed by the Applicant under the Contract were no more than ordinary commercial risks normally assumed by salvors.36 Therefore, while the Applicant had satisfied the risk criterion in the quantitative sense, the Tribunal concluded that the quality of the assumed risk was not something which established ICSID practice and jurisprudence would recognise.37\n\n*Id.,* para. 112.\n\n*Id.*\n\n22.\n\nAs regards the fifth hallmark, \"Contribution to the Economic Development of the Host State,\" the Tribunal considered that \"the weight of the authorities... swings in favour of requiring a significant contribution to be made to the host State\u2019s economy.\"38 In particular, the Tribunal held that, given \"all the circumstances of the factual matrix in this case... the question of contribution to the host State\u2019s economic development assumes significant importance because the other typical hallmarks of \u2018investment\u2019 are either not decisive or appear only to be superficially satisfied.\"39 The Tribunal concluded that the \"benefits offered by the Contract to Malaysia were of a different nature to those offered in *CSOB, Jan de Nul* and *Bayindir\"40* in its view, the \"benefits flowing from the Contract were no different from the benefits flowing to the place of the performance of any normal service contract. The benefit was not lasting, in the sense envisaged in the public infrastructure or banking infrastructure projects,\"41 which were likely to provide positive economic development to the host State.\n\n*Id,* para. 123.\n\n*Id.,* para. 130.\n\n*Id.,* para. 144.\n\nAward, para. 144.\n\n23.\n\nThe Award accordingly concluded that the Applicant\u2019s claim failed *in limine* and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.42 Having concluded that the Contract was not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal found it unnecessary to discuss whether the Contract was an \"investment\" under the Agreement.43\n\n*Id.,* para. 146.\n\n*Id.,* para. 148.\n\n**C. THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS**\n--------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nBy an Application for Annulment dated 7 September 2007, the Applicant applied to ICSID for an annulment of the Award pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Application, which was made within the time prescribed by Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention, was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 17 September 2007.\n\n25.\n\nOn October 30, 2007, an *ad hoc* committee (the \"Committee\") was constituted, its members consisting of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel (United States), Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen (Guyana) and Judge Peter Tomka (Slovak Republic), together the \"Committee.\" The parties were so notified on 30 October 2007 when they were also informed that Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. On 6 November 2007, the Secretary of the Committee informed the parties that Judge Schwebel had been designated by the other members of the Committee as its President. On 26 September 2008, the Committee and parties were informed that due to a redistribution of the Centre\u2019s workload, Ms. Aissatou Diop, Consultant, ICSID, had been assigned to serve as Secretary of the Committee in replacement of Mr. Onwuamaegbu.\n\n26.\n\nThe first session of the Committee, originally planned for 3 December 2007, was postponed, due to the delay of the initial advance payment to the Centre by the Applicant. It was held on 31 March 2008 in The Hague. In accordance with the procedural time table set out by the Committee at its first session in consultation with the parties, the Applicant filed its Memorial on Annulment on 30 May 2008. The Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on 15 September 2008. The Applicant then filed its Reply on 13 October 2008, and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 10 November 2008. A hearing took place on 3 December 2008 in The Hague. During the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication, including a meeting in The Hague on 4 December 2008.\n\n**D. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(a) Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn, Bhd**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Applicant bases its request for an annulment of the Award on the ground that, in deciding that the Centre had no jurisdiction over the dispute and the Tribunal lacked competence to consider the claims submitted to it, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.44 The Applicant relies on *Vivendi v. Argentine Republic45* as a basis for its argument that the failure of a tribunal to exercise jurisdiction which it possesses constitutes an excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b).46 It noted that it was common ground between the parties that such failure constitutes an excess of powers.\n\nApplication for Annulment, para. 8.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, para. 86: \"[i]t is settled, and neither party disputes, that an ICSID tribunal commits an excess of powers not only if it exercises a jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Convention, read together, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments.\"\n\n*See* Applicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 42 - 48.\n\n28.\n\nThe Applicant presents three main arguments in support of its claim that the Tribunal\u2019s decision that it lacked jurisdiction was a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b). First, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal applied an overly-restrictive definition of the term \"investment.\" The Applicant submits that the Tribunal failed to apply the guiding principles set down in the Vienna Convention, and accordingly disregarded the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment.\"47 The Applicant argues that the drafters of the ICSID Convention rejected restrictions on the meaning of the word \"investment\" during the Convention negotiations, and concluded that the meaning of the term would be left open. Accordingly, the Applicant argues that the term \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention was intended to be a broad and inclusive concept.48 The Applicant also submits that the Tribunal failed to take account of the ICSID Convention\u2019s *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* a supplementary means of interpretation provided for by Article 32 of the Vienna Convention,49 that were directly relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis in this case. In the view of the Applicant, those *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* contain numerous discussions of the definition of \"investment\" and confirm the broad ordinary meaning of the term.50 They establish that the drafters of the ICSID Convention decided against defining the term \"investment.\" They show that they rejected a monetary floor for the value of an investment in order for it to be treated as an investment under Article 25(1). And they indicate that it was accepted that great weight in the definition of investment in the particular case would be given to the intentions of the Parties to the BIT or other instrument that provided for recourse to ICSID.\n\n*See* Applicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 50 - 55.\n\n*See id.,* paras. 57 - 67, 74\n\nArticle 32 of the Vienna Convention provides: \"[r]ecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"\n\n*See* Applicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 50 - 57.\n\n29.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s second argument is that the Tribunal elevated characteristic-based tests to the level of jurisdictional conditions. The Applicant submits that the Tribunal identified certain \"characteristics\" or \"hallmarks\" of an investment from cases which it termed the \"critical cases on investment,\" considering them to be (i) Regularity of Profits and Returns; (ii) Contributions; (iii) Duration of the Contract; (iv) Risks Assumed under the Contract; and (v) Contribution to the Economic Development of the Host State.51 The Tribunal\u2019s error, according to the Applicant, was to elevate these characteristics to the level of jurisdictional \"conditions\" of an investment and to conclude that it was \"essential\" to a claim that these investment characteristics be met.52 The Applicant argues that these conditions do not originate in the text of the ICSID Convention itself, and are inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\" and the ICSID Convention\u2019s *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires53* The Applicant contends that the Tribunal effectively narrowed the meaning of the term \"investment\" in a manner inconsistent with the intention of the Convention drafters and its signatory states.54\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 31-33, citing Award, headings at pp. 35 - 43.\n\n*Id.,* para. 79, citing Award, para. 106(d) and (e).\n\n*Id.,* paras. 32, 77.\n\n*Id.,* para. 82.\n\n30.\n\nThe Applicant makes an additional argument that the Tribunal improperly introduced a further jurisdictional requirement of \"contribution to the economic development of the host State,\" having extrapolated this additional condition from a sentence in the Preamble of the ICSID Convention: **\"[c]onsidering** the need for international cooperation for economic development.\"55 The Applicant relies on the Award in *Pey Casado v. Chili56* to argue that this sentence of the Preamble does not establish a condition for investment, but merely reflects that such \"\u2018economic development\u2019 would be a desirable and natural *consequence* of investment.\"57\n\n*Id.,* para. 69.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado et Fondation Presidente Allende\u2019 c. R\u00e9publique du Chili,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Sentence arbitrale, 8 May 2008.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 71, citing Pey *Casado v. Chili,* para. 232.\n\n31.\n\nThirdly, and in the alternative, the Applicant argues that, even if the Tribunal was correct to adopt a characteristics-based approach, it erred in introducing an additional requirement that the investment characteristics must not only be present \"quantitatively,\" but that they must also be present \"qualitatively\" and \"to a sufficient degree before an \u2018investment\u2019 can be found.\"58 The Applicant argues that despite finding that certain of the investment conditions were met, the Tribunal erroneously held that the Contract did not constitute an \"investment\" because it found that the investment characteristics or conditions did not exist to a sufficient \"qualitative\" extent. The Applicant submits that \"[t]hese \u2018qualitative\u2019 conditions have no basis in law,\"59 and are \"alien to the meaning of \u2018investment\u2019 in the ICSID Convention.\"60 The Applicant then proceeds to analyse each of the characteristics of an investment enumerated by the Tribunal, to illustrate the \"qualitative\" approach which it argues the Tribunal erred in adopting.\n\n*Id.,* para. 39.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 85.\n\n*Id.,* para. 84.\n\n32.\n\nAs regards the first characteristic, \"Regularity of Profits and Returns,\" the Applicant acknowledges that the Tribunal held that this feature is not always critical and accepted that the absence of this element was immaterial to the determination of whether the Contract constitutes an \"investment.\"61\n\n*Id.,* para. 87, citing Award, para. 108.\n\n33.\n\nConcerning the second characteristic, \"Contributions,\" the Applicant argues that the Tribunal erred in considering that \"the size of the contributions were in no way comparable to those found in *Salini, Bayindir* and *Jan de Nul....\"62* The Applicant recalls that minimum monetary limits for investments were canvassed during the negotiations of Article 25(1), but were rejected.63 The Applicant accordingly submits that the fact that its contributions were smaller than those mentioned in the case law surveyed by the Tribunal is of no relevance.64\n\n*Id.,* para. 90, citing Award, para. 109.\n\n*Id.,* para. 92.\n\n*Id.,* para. 93.\n\n34.\n\nAs regards the third characteristic, the \"Duration of the Contract,\" the Applicant argues that the Tribunal erred in finding that because the duration of the Contract depended on the element of fortuity, it did not meet the duration criterion \"in the qualitative sense envisaged by ICSID jurisprudence.\"65 The Applicant contends that there is no legal authority for this additional \"qualitative\" requirement, and that the Tribunal\u2019s finding is in contradiction to the ICSID Convention\u2019s *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* which show that a requirement of a minimum duration of five years for an investment was debated and rejected by the drafters.66 The Applicant also submits that the Tribunal confused its assessment of whether the element of duration was met with the separate issue of whether the investment would promote the economy and development of the host State.67\n\n*Id.,* para. 98, citing Award, para. 111.\n\n*See* Applicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 98 - 101.\n\n*Id.,* para. 99.\n\n35.\n\nConcerning the fourth characteristic, the \"Risks Assumed under the Contract,\" the Applicant argues that the Tribunal again erred by concluding that \"while [the Applicant] may have satisfied the risk characteristic or criterion in a quantitative sense (i.e., that there was inherent risk assumed under the Contract), the quality of the assumed risk was not something which established ICSID practice and jurisprudence would recognize.\"68 The Applicant reiterates its argument that there is no legal justification for this qualitative requirement in the ICSID jurisprudence, and that the Tribunal\u2019s approach led it to make a manifest jurisdictional error.69\n\n*Id.,* para. 105, citing Award, para. 112.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 106- 107.\n\n36.\n\nThe final investment characteristic discussed by the Tribunal is a \"Contribution to the Economic Development of the Host State.\" The Applicant argues that this condition is not supported by the text of the ICSID Convention.70 However, the Applicant argues that, even if this characteristic were a condition, the Tribunal erred in finding that, although the Contract contributed to Malaysia\u2019s economic development, \"this benefit is not of the same quality or quantity envisaged in previous ICSID jurisprudence.\"71 The Applicant submits that there was no basis for the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the economic contribution to the host State be \"substantial\" or \"significant,\"72 and argues that \"[t]his additional threshold, arbitrarily imposed by the Tribunal, is manifestly not found in the text of the Preamble, nor in the text of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"73\n\n*Id.,* para. 121.\n\n*Id.,* para. 116, citing Award para. 132.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 110-113, 121.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 121.\n\n37.\n\nThe Applicant therefore concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of whether the Contract satisfies the characteristic of an investment suffers from manifest and fundamental flaws arising out of (i) the Tribunal\u2019s failure to consider the text of the Convention and its *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires',* (ii) the overriding significance given to the facts found in its selection of ICSID cases, which it effectively elevated to binding precedent; and (iii) its requirement that each of the investment \"conditions\" should be present to a sufficient \"qualitative\" degree. The Applicant submits that the Award should be annulled in its entirety in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n38.\n\nThe Applicant also argued that the Tribunal should \"have considered the BIT definition of \u2018investment\u2019 because it was expressly defined by the United Kingdom and Malaysia to be extremely broad and encompassing \u2018every kind of asset,\"\u201974 the suggestion being that an investment within this broad definition governs the scope of an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Id.,* p. 7, footnote 32.\n\n39.\n\nThe foregoing derives from the Applicant\u2019s Memorial. It was reiterated by the Applicant\u2019s Reply. The Reply submitted that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which restricts annulment to cases in which \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers,\" does not visualize a procedure in which the *ad hoc* Committee first determines whether the Tribunal has exceeded its powers and then, if it determines that the Tribunal has exceeded its powers, as a separate stage of the analysis determines whether the excess is manifest. By that procedure, a wrong holding that there is jurisdiction will be allowed to stand unless, as a separate stage of the analysis, it is found that the error was manifest. The Applicant submits that there is a single determination, and that it is concerned with the question whether the Tribunal has exceeded its powers. In this respect, the Applicant argued that a wrong jurisdictional holding is by its nature manifest. (At the oral hearing, the Applicant did not rely on the latter argument but rather argued that the errors of the Tribunal were manifest on other grounds, namely those described above.)\n\n40.\n\nOn the question whether the economic development of the host State is a requirement of an investment, the Applicant submits in its Reply that all the Preamble of the ICSID Convention observes is that contribution to economic development of the host State is a possible consequence but not a condition of investment. In other words, \"while the ICSID Convention\u2019s Preamble recognises that in protecting \u2018investments\u2019, the Convention encourages development of the host state, this does not mean that the development of the host state is a constitutive *condition* of an \u2018investment\u2019 within the meaning of the Convention.\"75\n\nApplicant\u2019s Reply, para. 19.\n\n41.\n\nIn oral argument before the Committee on 3 December 2008, the Applicant reiterated its contentions, emphasising that the Tribunal did find that, in some respects, the outlay contributed to the economy of the Respondent and submitting that, however small was the contribution, it supported the nature of the outlay as being that of an investment. There was no basis for the Tribunal\u2019s treating investment in infrastructure or banking as investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention while holding that investment in the cultural history and museum content of a host State was outside the meaning of the Convention. The Salvor was required to utilise its expertise, labour and equipment, to invest its own financial and other resources, and assume all risks of the salvage operation, financial and physical. It was required to search for and secure the wreck, bring the cargo to the surface, clean, restore, inventory and photograph the salvaged items, and arrange for their sale. The fact that this was the first salvage contract to be at issue in an ICSID case, and that the contribution to the economy of Malaysia of the contract\u2019s implementation was small, hardly supported the conclusions of the Sole Arbitrator that the quality of the assumed risk was not of a kind that ICSID jurisprudence would recognise, and that the undoubted risk must be discounted because it was an ordinary commercial risk that did not entail a significant contribution to the economic development of the host State.\n\n42.\n\nThe Applicant requested the Committee to order the Respondent the reimbursement of all costs and expenses incurred by the Applicant in connection with the annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of legal counsel.76\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 129 and Applicant\u2019s Reply, para. 77.\n\n**(b) The Government of Malaysia**\n----------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Committee to reject the Applicant\u2019s request for annulment of the Award in its entirety. The Respondent\u2019s position is that the Application demonstrates no basis for annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. It urges, *inter alia,* that \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention means an investment for the economic development of the host State, that the Applicant\u2019s outlay was not for that purpose, and that the claim is accordingly outside of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that, in declining jurisdiction, the Tribunal did not \"manifestly exceed its powers\" as required for an annulment under Article 52(1)(b), and that the Applicant is in effect asking the Committee to annul the Award on the basis that the Committee should take a different view from the Tribunal either on \"the Article 25 question *per se,* or on the question of whether or not the individual hallmarks were satisfied in its individual case.\"77\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 122.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument centers on the nature of an annulment in ICSID proceedings. According to the Respondent, annulment is an *^extraordinary and narrowly circumscribed remedy'78* and the mandate of the Committee in an annulment proceeding is \"narrow and limited.\"79 The Respondent argues that the Applicant\u2019s Application \"falls well outside of the Committee\u2019s mandate.\"80 It submits that finality of proceedings is an important component for the integrity of the ICSID process, and annulment is a limited exception and must be exercised only in the narrow circumstances mandated by Article 52.81\n\n*Id.,* para. 39.\n\n*Id.,* Title of Section III.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 36.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 43.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises the distinction between an annulment and an appeal. It submits that two main distinctions exist: the first relates to the result of the process when an annulment or appeal is successful, the second relates to the legal basis of the challenge to the underlying award.82 The Respondent relies on ICSID jurisprudence to the effect that annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision; in its view, the Applicant\u2019s Memorial reveals that at the heart of its Application lies an objection to the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s finding on whether the Contract was an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention.83 That kind of objection, submits the Respondent, is not within the scope of an application for annulment.\n\n*See id,* para. 46.\n\n*Id.,* para. 51.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent does not agree with the Applicant\u2019s proposition that an annulment is warranted because the Tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers\" under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers at all. Rather, in declining jurisdiction on the basis that the Contract was not an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention, the Respondent submits that \"the Tribunal acted entirely within its powers.\"84 The Respondent maintains that, in essence, the Applicant is required by Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention to demonstrate that the conclusions reached in the Award in relation to the investment question were \"beyond the scope of reasonable debate [and the Applicant] palpably failed to do so.\"85\n\n*Id.,* para. 55.\n\n*Id.,* para. 56.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent bases this argument on its view that the Tribunal correctly concluded that the Contract was not an \"investment\" under Article 25(1). It submits that, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s assertions, the Tribunal correctly considered that \"investment\" has an objective meaning under Article 25(1),86 and the Applicant\u2019s argument that the consent of the parties should provide a guiding light when determining whether an \"investment\" exists would lead to an absurdity, given that Article 25 places an outer limit upon parties\u2019 ability to refer disputes to ICSID.87 The Respondent also disputes the Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Tribunal disregarded the Vienna Convention, and argues that not only was the Tribunal mindful of the Convention, but that its approach to interpretation was entirely consistent with the Convention.88\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial., paras. 62 - 68.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 65, 68.\n\n*Id.,* para. 70.\n\n49.\n\nAs regards the \"hallmarks\" of an investment, the Respondent argues that the Applicant misrepresents the case in saying that (1) the Tribunal adopted strict jurisdictional conditions; (2) the Tribunal found that the hallmarks of an investment were present; and (3) the Tribunal arbitrarily imposed an additional \"qualitative\" pre-condition for jurisdiction. The Respondent contends that \"the Tribunal\u2019s identification of five hallmarks of investment under Article 25(1), and its *\u2018fact-specific and holistic'* approach to determine the extent to which those hallmarks were met, are uncontroversial.\"89 The Respondent argues that \"[t]he Tribunal\u2019s approach is entirely consistent with the \u2018global assessment\u2019 employed by previous ICSID tribunals, which requires the hallmarks of investment to be \u2018examined in their totality\u2019 on the facts of any given case.\"90 In the Respondent\u2019s view, even if the Tribunal had imposed a stricter regime based on the jurisdictional conditions approach, this would not have provided a basis for annulment, given that previous and subsequent tribunals have themselves employed such an approach.91\n\n*Id.,* para. 85, citation omitted.\n\n*Id.,* para. 85.\n\n*Id.,* para. 86, relying on *L.E.S.I-DIPENTA v. Algeria,* para. 13(iv) and *Pey Casado v. Chili,* paras. 231 -232.\n\n50.\n\nIn response to the Applicant\u2019s argument that the Tribunal effectively elevated characteristics found in the jurisprudence into \"binding precedent,\" the Respondent argues that the Tribunal legitimately referred to ICSID jurisprudence and leading commentary,92 and that its extensive citing of ICSID jurisprudence only enhances the legal credibility of the Award and its insusceptibility to annulment. The Respondent points out that the Tribunal \"noted that each of the hallmarks of investment that it identified had been recognised and applied by previous ICSID tribunals.\"93 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the \"Tribunal conducted a meticulous analysis of the meaning of \u2018investment\u2019 under Article 25 of the Convention, analysing previous ICSID jurisprudence and leading commentary, and reached a conclusion based on its assessment of the detailed facts of the case. [Accordingly t]he Tribunal... did not exceed its powers at all.\"94\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 87 - 100.\n\n*Id.,* para. 90.\n\n*Id.,* para. 100.\n\n51.\n\nEven if the Tribunal exceeded its powers (which the Respondent disputes), the Respondent argues that this would not provide any basis for the annulment of the Award, given that, in the view of the Respondent, the Tribunal did not \"manifestly\" exceed its powers.95 The Respondent contends that the \"manifest\" requirement under Article 52(1)(b) sets a high threshold, and cites from an article in which its author takes the view that *\"the addition of the word \u2018manifestly \u2019 to the language of paragraph (b) is a serious restriction of the authority of an ad hoc Committee under Article 52'\"96* The Respondent also notes that the concept of \"manifest\" exists elsewhere in the Convention and Arbitration Rules. The Respondent submits that the interpretation of these other provisions support the view that the concept *\"sets a high bar to the application of any provision so conditioned\"97*\n\n*See id.,* paras. 101 - 123.\n\n*Id.,* para. 106, citing Mark B. Feldman, *The Annulment Proceedings and the Finality of ICSID Arbitral Awards, 2* ICSID REVIEW-FILJ. 101 (1987).\n\n*Id.,* para. 112, citing *CDC Group pic v. Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Seychelles, 29 June 2005 *(\"CDC Group v. Seychelles\"),* para. 42.\n\n52.\n\nTaking the threshold set by the \"manifest\" concept into account, the Respondent then submits that the Applicant has failed to demonstrate that any excess of powers by the Tribunal authorizes the Committee to annul under Article 52(1)(b).98 It contends that, to annul the award, the Committee must conclude that the Tribunal\u2019s approach is so preposterous that it falls beyond the reasonable scope of the debate on the precise meaning of the term \u2019\u2019investment\" under Article 25(1). The Respondent argues that this is not the case, and submits that the Committee must reject the Applicant\u2019s arguments and \"dismiss the Application on the basis that there was no manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal.\"99\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 120 - 123.\n\n*Id.,* para. 123.\n\n53.\n\nIn its Rejoinder of 10 November 2008, the Respondent emphasizes its argument that the Committee only has competence if an error of the Tribunal was \"manifest.\" It argues that a jurisdictional mistake is not necessarily a manifest excess of powers and that the Applicant has not given appropriate weight to this proposition.\n\n54.\n\nIn oral argument before the Committee on 3 December 2008, the Respondent reiterated its case, emphasising that, even if the Committee found that there was a manifest excess of jurisdiction, it had the discretion to uphold the Award.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent also asks that the Committee require the Applicant to bear all of the costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with the annulment proceedings.100\n\n*Id.,* para. 125 and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, para. 100.\n\n**E. ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThis case concerns the interpretation of treaties. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a product of the extended codification processes of the International Law Commission of the United Nations led by a succession of exceptionally distinguished Special Rapporteurs, has been widely accepted, 108 States being party. Among the States that have ratified it are Malaysia and the United Kingdom. The Committee notes that the Vienna Convention as such is not applicable to the 1965 Washington Convention nor to the 1981 United Kingdom - Malaysia BIT. The Vienna Convention applies only to treaties which are concluded by States after its entry into force with regard to such States. Malaysia became party to the Vienna Convention only in 1994. The non-retroactivity of the Vienna Convention is, however, \"[w]ithout prejudice to the application of any rules set [in it] to which treaties would be subject under international law independently of the Convention.\"101 The Convention\u2019s provisions on the interpretation of treaties, embodied in Articles 31102 and 32103, while contested when adopted, have been accepted by the International Court of Justice104 and the international community as expressive not only of treaty commitment but of customary international law. The Committee thus considers itself on firm ground in resorting to the customary rules on interpretation of treaties as codified in the Vienna Convention.\n\nVienna Convention, Article 4.\n\nArticle 31 provides:  \n 1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.  \n 2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:  \n (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;  \n (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.  \n 3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:  \n (a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;  \n (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;  \n (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.  \n 4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\nSee *supra* note 49 for the text of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n*See* *Territorial Dispute (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya/Chad),* Judgment, *I.C.J. Reports 1994,* pp. 21-22, para. 41; *Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia),* Judgment, *I.C.J. Reports 1999,* p. 1059, para. 18.\n\n57.\n\nThe \"ordinary meaning\" of the term \"investment\" is the commitment of money or other assets for the purpose of providing a return. In its context and in accordance with the object and purpose of the treaty - which is to promote the flow of private investment to contracting countries by provision of a mechanism which, by enabling international settlement of disputes, conduces to the security of such investment - the term \"investment\" is unqualified. The purpose of the ICSID Convention was described in a draft of the Convention conveyed by the Bank's General Counsel to the Executive Directors of the Bank in these terms: \"[t]he purpose of this Convention is to promote the resolution of disputes arising between the Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States by encouraging and facilitating recourse to international conciliation and arbitration.\"105 The meaning of the term \"investment\" may however be regarded as \"ambiguous or obscure\" under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention and hence justifying resort to the preparatory work of the Convention \"to determine the meaning.\" As the pleadings in the instant case illustrate, there certainly have been marked differences among ICSID tribunals and among commentators on the meaning of \"investment\" as that term appears in Article 25(1) of the Convention. Thus the provision may be regarded as ambiguous. In any event, courts and tribunals interpreting treaties regularly review the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* whenever they are brought to their attention; it is mythological to pretend that they do so only when they first conclude that the term requiring interpretation is ambiguous or obscure.\n\nICSID, History of the ICSID Convention: Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"History of the ICSID Convention\"), Volume I, p. 16 (1968).\n\n58.\n\nAt issue in this case is the meaning of the treaty term \"investment\" as that term is used in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\u2014but also in Article 1 of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Malaysia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments because that instrument is the medium through which the Contracting States involved have given their consent to the exercise of jurisdiction of ICSID.\n\n59.\n\nArticle 1 of that Agreement defines \"investment\" capaciously.\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement\n\n(1)(a) \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n\u2026\n\n(ii) shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property of such companies;\n\n(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;\n\n(iv) intellectual property rights... ;\n\n(v) business concessions conferred... under contract....\n\n60.\n\nThe Contract between the Government of Malaysia and Malaysian Historical Salvors is one of a kind of asset; what is precisely at issue between the Government and the Salvor is a claim to money and to performance under a contract having financial value; the contract involves intellectual property rights; and the right granted to salvage may be treated as a business concession conferred under contract.\n\n61.\n\nIt follows that, by the terms of the Agreement, and for its purposes, the Contract is an investment. There is no room for another conclusion. The Sole Arbitrator did not reach another considered conclusion in respect of the Agreement. He rather chose to examine, virtually exclusively, the question of whether there was an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Finding that there was not, he found that \"it is unnecessary to discuss whether the Contract is an \u2018investment\u2019 under the BIT.\"106 Nevertheless the Sole Arbitrator observed that, \"while the Contract did provide some benefit to Malaysia,\" there was not \"a sufficient contribution to Malaysia\u2019s economic development to qualify as an \u2018investment\u2019 for the purposes of Article 25(1) or Article 1(a) of the BIT.\"107 He provided an extensive analysis in support of his conclusion in respect of the ICSID Convention, but none in respect of his conclusion in respect of the BIT. The Committee is unable to see what support the Sole Arbitrator could have mustered to sustain the conclusion that the Contract and its implementation did not constitute an investment within the meaning of that Agreement. On the contrary, (and subject to the consideration noted below in paragraph 81 of this Decision), it is clear that the Contract and its performance by the Salvor constitute an investment as that term is defined by the Agreement.\n\nAward, para. 148\n\n*Id.,* para. 143\n\n62.\n\nUnder Article 7 of the Agreement, the sole recourse in the event that a legal dispute between the investor and the host State should arise which is not settled by agreement between them through pursuit of local remedies or otherwise is reference to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Unlike some other BITs, no third party dispute settlement options are provided in the alternative to ICSID. It follows that, if jurisdiction is found to be absent under the ICSID Convention, the investor is left without international recourse altogether. That result is difficult to reconcile with the intentions of the Governments of Malaysia and the United Kingdom in concluding their Agreement, as those intentions are reflected by the terms of Article 7 as well as the Agreement\u2019s inclusive definition of what is an investment. It cannot be accepted that the Governments of Malaysia and the United Kingdom concluded a treaty providing for arbitration of disputes arising under it in respect of investments so comprehensively described, with the intention that the only arbitral recourse provided between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, that of ICSID, could be rendered nugatory by a restrictive definition of a deliberately undefined term of the ICSID Convention, namely, \"investment,\" as it is found in the provision of Article 25(1). It follows that the Award of the Sole Arbitrator is incompatible with the intentions and specifications of the States immediately concerned, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.\n\n63.\n\nWhat of the intentions of the Parties in concluding the Washington Convention? The term \"investment\" was deliberately left undefined. But light is shed on the intentions of the Parties in respect of that term by the Convention\u2019s *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* as well as the Convention\u2019s interpretation by the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in adopting and opening it for signature.\n\n64.\n\nThe World Bank staffs initial proposal on \"The Jurisdiction of the Center\" provided, in Section 1 (1): \"The jurisdiction of the Center shall be limited to disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States and shall be based on consent.\"108 Section 1 (3) provided: \"Except as otherwise agreed between the parties, the Center shall not exercise jurisdiction in respect of disputes involving claims of less than the equivalent of one hundred thousand United States dollars determined as of the time of submission of the dispute.\"109 The comment on this proviso reads:\n\nParagraph (3) places a monetary limit on claims to be submitted to the Center. Arbitration is a not inexpensive procedure and parties should not be forced to have resort to it if the amount claimed remains below a certain limit which, for purposes of illustration, has been put at the equivalent of U.S. $100,OOO.110\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Volume II-l, p. 33.\n\n*Id.,* Volume II-1, p. 34.\n\n*Id.*\n\n65.\n\nThe First Draft of what became Article 25(1) of the Convention provided: \"(1) The jurisdiction of the Center shall extend to all legal disputes between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, arising out of or in connection with any investment, which the parties to such disputes have consented to submit to it.\"111 It further provided that: \"(i) \u2018investment\u2019 means any contribution of money or other asset of economic value for an indefinite period or, if the period be defined, for not less than five years.\"112 A further attempted definition by the Bank\u2019s Secretariat reads:\n\nThe term \u2018investment\u2019 means the acquisition of (i) property rights or contractual rights (including rights under a concession) for the establishment or in the conduct of an industrial, commercial, agricultural, financial or service enterprise; (ii) participations or shares in any such enterprise; or (iii) financial obligations of a public or private entity other than obligations arising out of short-term banking or credit facilities.113\n\n*Id.,* Volume I, p. 116.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.,* Volume II-2, p. 844.\n\n66.\n\nThe reaction of States and their representatives to these proposals was mixed. In the event, their specifications were rejected. While they elicited some support, the prevailing view was that there should be no monetary limit on claims submitted and that the contribution of money or other asset of economic value need not be for an indefinite period or for not less than five years.114 More than this, a British proposal that omitted any definition of the term \"investment,\" on the ground that a definition would only create jurisdictional difficulties, \"was adopted by a large majority in the Legal Committee.\"115\n\n\"In a draft preceding the Working Paper, a lower limit ($100,000) had been fixed for the subject-matter of the dispute. That provision had not been retained... because disputes involving small amounts could be important as test cases, whereas there would be other cases in which it would be impossible to place a pecuniary value on the subject-matter of a dispute.\" History of the ICSID Convention, Volume II-l, p. 567.\n\nChristoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, p. 123 (2001), citing to History of the ICSID Convention, Volume II-2, p. 826.\n\n67.\n\nThat result was consistent with the position of the General Counsel of the Bank, Mr. Broches, who served as chairman of the regional meetings of legal experts of governments and of the Legal Committee. Thus,\n\nMr. Broches called attention to the fact that the document did not limit or define the types of disputes which might be submitted to conciliation or arbitration under the auspices of the Center. It was difficult to find a satisfactory definition. There was the danger that recourse to the services of the Center might in a given situation be precluded because the dispute in question did not precisely qualify under the definition of the convention. There was the further danger that a definition might provide a reluctant party with an opportunity to frustrate or delay the proceedings by questioning whether the dispute was encompassed by the definition. These possibilities suggested that it was inadvisable to define narrowly the kinds of disputes that could be submitted. Moreover, Mr. Broches added, a contracting state would be free to announce that it did not intend to use the facilities of the Center for particular kinds of disputes.116\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Volume II-l, p. 54.\n\n68.\n\nMr. Broches elsewhere explained that:\n\nsince the jurisdiction of the Center is limited by the overriding condition of consent, the exclusions desired by the one or the other delegation could be achieved by a refusal of consent in those cases in which in their view there was no proper case for use of the facilities of the Center. Refusal of consent would be an adequate safeguard for host States....\n\nThe purpose of Section 1 is not to define the circumstances in which recourse to the facilities of the Center would in fact occur, but rather to indicate the outer limits within which the Center would have jurisdiction provided the parties\u2019 consent had been attained. Beyond these outer limits no use could be made of the facilities of the Center even with such consent.117\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Volume II-l, p. 566.\n\n69.\n\nHowever it is important to note that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* do not support the imposition of \"outer limits\" such as those imposed by the Sole Arbitrator in this case. Little more about the nature of outer limits is indicated in the *travaux* than is contained in Article 25(1), namely that, \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment....\" It appears to have been assumed by the Convention\u2019s drafters that use of the term \"investment\" excluded a simple sale and like transient commercial transactions from the jurisdiction of the Centre. Judicial or arbitral construction going further in interpretation of the meaning of \"investment\" by the establishment of criteria or hallmarks may or may not be regarded as plausible, but the intentions of the draftsmen of the ICSID Convention, as the *travaux* show them to have been, lend those criteria (and still less, conditions) scant support.\n\n70.\n\nThe Report of the Bank\u2019s Executive Directors is similarly illuminating. In the debate over the draft of that Report, Mr. Broches recalled that none of the suggested definitions for the word \"investment\" had proved acceptable. He suggested that while it might be difficult to define the term, an investment in fact was readily recognizable. He proposed that the Report should say that the Executive Directors did not think it necessary or desirable to attempt a definition. After some further debate, the Report was adopted in the following terms:\n\nConsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\nWhile consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.\n\n\u2026\n\nNo attempt was made to define the term \u2018investment\u2019 given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4)).118\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States,* March 18, 1965 (\"Report of the Executive Directors\"), paras. 23, 25, 27.\n\n71.\n\nThe preparatory work of the Convention as well as the Report of the Executive Directors thus shows that: (a) deliberately no definition of \"investment\" as that term is found in Article 25(1) was adopted; (b) a floor limit to the value of an investment was rejected; (c) a requirement of indefinite duration of an investment or of a duration of no less than five years was rejected; (d) the critical criterion adopted was the consent of the parties. By the terms of their consent, they could define jurisdiction under the Convention. Paragraph 23 of the Report provides that: \"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre....\" Paragraph 27 imports that the term \"investment\" was left undefined \"given the essential requirement of consent by the parties.\" It continues that \"States can make known in advance... the classes of disputes which they would or would not submit to the Centre,\" *i.e.,* they could specify particularities of their consent.\n\n72.\n\nDoes the passage of paragraph 25 that \"consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto\" indicate that \"investment\" as used in Article 25(1) has an objective content that cannot be varied by the consent of the parties? Only to the following limited extent. \"[T]he nature of the dispute\" appears to refer to the dispute being a legal dispute. The reference to \"the parties thereto\" merely means that for a dispute to be within the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, the parties must be a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. These fundaments, and the equally fundamental assumption that the term \"investment\" does not mean \"sale,\" appear to comprise \"the outer limits,\" the inner content of which is defined by the terms of the consent of the parties to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n73.\n\nWhile it may not have been foreseen at the time of the adoption of the ICSID Convention, when the number of bilateral investment treaties in force were few, since that date some 2800 bilateral, and three important multilateral, treaties have been concluded, which characteristically define investment in broad, inclusive terms such as those illustrated by the above-quoted Article 1 of the Agreement between Malaysia and the United Kingdom. Some 1700 of those treaties are in force, and the multilateral treaties, particularly the Energy Charter Treaty, which are in force, of themselves endow ICSID with an important jurisdictional reach. It is those bilateral and multilateral treaties which today are the engine of ICSID\u2019s effective jurisdiction. To ignore or depreciate the importance of the jurisdiction they bestow upon ICSID, and rather to embroider upon questionable interpretations of the term \"investment\" as found in Article 25(1) of the Convention, risks crippling the institution.\n\n74.\n\nIn the light of this history of the preparation of the ICSID Convention and of the foregoing analysis of the Report of the Executive Directors in adopting it, the Committee finds that the failure of the Sole Arbitrator even to consider, let alone apply, the definition of investment as it is contained in the Agreement to be a gross error that gave rise to a manifest failure to exercise jurisdiction.\n\n75.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee recognizes that the Sole Arbitrator acted in the train of several prior ICSID arbitral awards which lend a considerable measure of support to his approach. The seminal award is the Decision on Jurisdiction of a distinguished tribunal in *Salini* v. *Morocco.* The Respondent objected to jurisdiction in respect of the existence of an investment. The Tribunal began with a consideration of the BIT. This consideration was preceded by the following observation:\n\nHowever, to the extent that the choice of jurisdiction clause was exercised in favour of ICSID, the rights at stake must equally constitute an investment in the sense of Article 25 of the Washington Agreement. The Arbitration Tribunal is therefore of the view that its jurisdiction depends on the existence of an investment both in the sense of the bilateral Agreement and of the Convention, following the case-law on this point.119\n\nIt proceeded to find jurisdiction under the BIT. It continued:\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there have been almost no cases where the notion of investment in the sense of Article 25 of the Convention has been raised. However, it would be misguided to consider that the demand of a dispute \u2018directly related to an investment\u2019 can always be equated with the consent of the contracting parties. In fact, the case-law of the ICSID and commentators are consistent in regarding the necessity of an investment as an objective condition for the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction to be activated (citation omitted).\n\nWith the exception of a decision of the Secretary General of the ICSID refusing to record a claim for arbitration regarding a dispute stemming from a simple sale, the decisions available have only very rarely focused on the concept of an investment (citation omitted).\n\nAcademic writings have generally observed that an investment suggests payments, a certain period of execution of the deal and participation in the risks of the transaction. A reading of the preamble of the Convention permits to add to these the criterion of contribution to the economic development of the State receiving the investment (citation omitted).\n\nIn truth, these various elements can be interdependent.... It results from this that these various criteria must be appreciated together....120\n\nThe Tribunal applied these criteria to the contract and concluded that it constituted an investment pursuant to the BIT as well as Article 25 of the Washington Convention.\n\n*Salini v. Morocco,* para. 44.\n\n*Salini v. Morocco,* para. 52.\n\n76.\n\n*Salini v. Morocco* is largely consistent with the leading commentary on the ICSID Convention. Professor Christoph Schreuer writes:\n\nit seems possible to identify certain features that are typical to most of the operations in question: the first such feature is that the projects have a certain *duration....* The second feature is a certain *regularity of profit and return....* The third feature is the assumption of *risk* usually by both sides. The fourth typical feature is that the commitment is *substantial....* The fifth feature is the operation\u2019s significance for the host State\u2019s *development.* This is not necessarily characteristic of investments in general. But the wording of the Preamble and the Executive Director\u2019s Report suggest that development is part of the Convention\u2019s object and purpose. These features should not necessarily be understood as jurisdictional requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the Convention (citations omitted).121\n\nSchreuer, *supra* note 115, p. 140.\n\n77.\n\nIt should be noted that Professor Schreuer, unlike the Sole Arbitrator in the instant case, does not treat these characteristics (or \"hallmarks\" in the usage of the Sole Arbitrator) \"as jurisdictional requirements.\"\n\n78.\n\nWhile this Committee\u2019s majority has every respect for the authors of the *Salini v. Morocco* Award and those that have followed it, such as the Award in *Joy Mining v. Egypt,* and for commentators who have adopted a like stance - and, it need hardly add, for its distinguished co-arbitrator who attaches an acute Dissent to this Decision - it gives precedence to awards and analyses122 that are consistent with its approach, which it finds consonant with the intentions of the Parties to the ICSID Convention.\n\n*See* Yulia Andreeva, *Salvaging or Sinking the Investment? MHS v. Malaysia Revisited,* THE LAW AND Practice of International Courts and Tribunals, Volume 7, No. 2, 2008, p. 161, and Devavish Krishan, *A Notion of ICSID Investment,* in T. Weiler (ed.), Investment Treaty Arbitration: A Debate and Discussion (2008).\n\n79.\n\nThe most recent Award that addresses the issue, of 24 July 2008, is, in the view of this Committee, the most persuasive, *Biwater v. Tanzania.*123 Its pertinent passages read:\n\n*The Criteria for an \u2018Investment\u2019\u2019.* An initial point arises as to the relevant test to be applied. In advancing submissions on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, parties not infrequently begin with the proposition that the term \u2018investment\u2019 is not defined in the ICSID Convention, and then proceed to apply each of the five criteria, or benchmarks, that were originally suggested by the arbitral tribunal in ***Fedax v. Venezuela,*** and restated (notably) in ***Salini v. Morocco,*** namely (i) duration; (ii) regularity of profit and return; (iii) assumption of risk; (iv) substantial commitment; and (v) significance for the host State\u2019s development (citations omitted).\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no basis for a rote, or overly strict, application of the five ***Salini*** criteria in every case. These criteria are not fixed or mandatory as a matter of law. They do not appear in the ICSID Convention. On the contrary, it is clear from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Convention that several attempts to incorporate a definition of \u2018investment\u2019 were made, but ultimately did not succeed. In the end, the term was left intentionally undefined, with the expectation (inter alia) that a definition could be the subject of agreement as between Contracting States. Hence the following oft-quoted passage in the Report of the Executive Directors:... (citations omitted).\n\nGiven that the Convention was not drafted with a strict, objective, definition of \u2018investment\u2019, it is doubtful that arbitral tribunals sitting in individual cases should impose one such definition which would be applicable in all cases and for all purposes. As noted by one commentator:\n\n\u2018There is no multilateral grant of authority over objective interpretation granted to individual tribunals sitting in cases of particular investor-State disputes.\u2019 [citing D. Krishan, \u2018A Notion of ICSID Investment\u2019 in Investment Treaty Arbitration: A Debate and Discussion (T. Weiler, ed. 2008).]\n\nFurther, the ***Salini Test*** itself is problematic if, as some tribunals have found, the \u2018typical characteristics\u2019 of an investment as identified in that decision are elevated into a fixed and inflexible test, and if transactions are to be presumed excluded from the ICSID Convention unless each of the five criteria are satisfied. This risks the arbitrary exclusion of certain types of transaction from the scope of the Convention. It also leads to a definition that may contradict individual agreements (as here), as well as a developing consensus in parts of the world as to the meaning of \u2018investment\u2019 (as expressed, e.g., in bilateral investment treaties). If very substantial numbers of BITs across the world express the definition of \u2018investment\u2019 more broadly than the ***Salini Test,*** and if this constitutes any type of international consensus, it is difficult to see why the ICSID Convention ought to be read more narrowly.\n\nEqually, the suggestion that the \u2018special and privileged arrangements established by the Washington Convention can be applied only to the type of investment which the Contracting States to that Convention envisaged\u2019 does not, in this Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, lead to a fixed or autonomous definition of \u2018investment\u2019 which must prevail in all cases, for the \u2018type of investment\u2019 which the Contracting States in fact envisaged was an intentionally undefined one, which was susceptible of agreement (citation omitted).\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that a more flexible and pragmatic approach to the meaning of \u2018investment\u2019 is appropriate, which takes into account the features identified in ***Salini,*** but along with all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the instrument containing the relevant consent to ICSID.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes in this regard that, over the years, many tribunals have approached the issue of the meaning of \u2018investment\u2019 by reference to the parties\u2019 agreement, rather than imposing a strict autonomous definition as per the ***Salini Test*** (citation omitted).\n\nTo this end, even if the Republic could demonstrate that any, or all, of the ***Salini*** criteria are not satisfied in this case, this would not necessarily be sufficient - in and of itself - to deny jurisdiction.124\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008 *(\"Biwater v. Tanzania\").*\n\n*Biwater v. Tanzania,* paras. 310, 312 - 18.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee fully appreciates that the ground for annulment set forth in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention specifies that \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.\" It is its considered conclusion that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to exercise the jurisdiction with which it was endowed by the terms of the Agreement and the Convention, and that it \"manifestly\" did so, for these reasons:\n\n(a) it altogether failed to take account of and apply the Agreement between Malaysia and the United Kingdom defining \"investment\" in broad and encompassing terms but rather limited itself to its analysis of criteria which it found to bear upon the interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention;\n\n(b) its analysis of these criteria elevated them to jurisdictional conditions, and exigently interpreted the alleged condition of a contribution to the economic development of the host State so as to exclude small contributions, and contributions of a cultural and historical nature;\n\n(c) it failed to take account of the preparatory work of the ICSID Convention and, in particular, reached conclusions not consonant with the *travaux* in key respects, notably the decisions of the drafters of the ICSID Convention to reject a monetary floor in the amount of an investment, to reject specification of its duration, to leave \u2018investment\u2019 undefined, and to accord great weight to the definition of investment agreed by the Parties in the instrument providing for recourse to ICSID.\n\n81.\n\nThe Committee thus is constrained to annul the Award of the Sole Arbitrator. It goes no farther; in particular, the decision as to whether there may be jurisdiction of an ICSID Tribunal in respect of the claim despite objections of Malaysia on still other grounds means that jurisdiction may be a matter for a newly constituted ICSID Tribunal to determine, should the Applicant seek its establishment.\n\n82.\n\nThe parties have submitted their costs and each maintains that the other should be required to meet the whole of them. The Committee takes note of the fact that the practice of virtually all ICSID annulment committees has been to divide the costs of ICSID - including the fees of the committee members and disbursements - equally between the parties, and that fees of counsel have been left to the party incurring them. However in this case the Committee has concluded that it was not the intent of the drafters of the ICSID Convention to exclude claimants advancing claims of minor financial dimension. If such claimants are left to pay not only the costs of their legal representation but half of the ICSID costs as well, the practical result could be to discourage if not debar small claims. In view of that consideration, as well as the fact that the Award stands annulled despite the Respondent's vigorous and comprehensive defence and adoption of it, and that, before the Sole Arbitrator, the Respondent argued (however understandably) for the essential conclusions that the Sole Arbitrator ultimately reached, the Committee holds that the Respondent shall meet all the Centre's costs of this annulment proceeding. The Applicant shall accordingly be reimbursed for those costs, which it has advanced by its deposits. Each party however shall be left to meet the costs of its legal representation and the disbursements flowing from it.\n\n**F. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n83.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES,\n\n(1) that the Award on Jurisdiction of 17 May 2007 of the Sole Arbitrator in *Malaysian Historical Salvors v. The Government of Malaysia* is annulled;\n\n(2) that the Government of Malaysia shall bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in connection with this annulment proceeding. Accordingly the Government of Malaysia shall reimburse the Applicant the advances paid by the latter to ICSID;\n\n(3) that each party shall bear its own costs of representation in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n84.\n\nJudge Shahabuddeen, while he has signed the Decision in authentication of its text, dissents from it. His Dissenting Opinion is appended to the Decision."}]}
