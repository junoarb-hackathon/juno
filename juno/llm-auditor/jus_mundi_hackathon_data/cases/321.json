THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A., two companies incorporated under the laws of Venezuela, which are owned and controlled by a Dutch corporation1 (jointly, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\nAccording to the July 2012 Request for Arbitration, the Claimants are controlled by OI European Group B.V. (OIEG), a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"**Venezuela**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\"). On August 10, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on February 14, 2013, comprised of Professor Hi-Taek Shin, a national of Korea, appointed as president pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, appointed by the Claimants, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Tribunal and the parties held a first session in Paris, France. During the session a number of procedural matters were decided, including a schedule for pleadings. In accordance with the schedule: (i) the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits on July 15, 2013; (ii) Venezuela filed a request to address objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter on August 16, 2013;2 (iii) Venezuela filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits on December 20, 2013; (iv) the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on March 21, 2014; (v) Venezuela filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and a Reply on Jurisdiction on June 20, 2014; and (vi) the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on August 21, 2014. A hearing on jurisdiction and merits was scheduled to be held in Paris, from March 30 through April 3, 2015.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 2 of September 23, 2013 the Tribunal declined Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 4, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal conveyed the following message from Mr. Mourre to the parties:\n\n*\"As from May 2015, I will leave Castaldi Mourre & Partners to establish my own individual arbitrator practice. I will also as from then have a consultancy agreement with the law firm of Dechert LLP with the title of Special Counsel. At Dechert, I will only work on specific matters on which Dechert will ask me to participate, and I will have no access whatsoever to databases for matters other than those on which I will work directly. I will have a fixed compensation from Dechert and will not share in its profits or costs. My arbitrator\u2019s work will therefore be completely separate from Dechert. As a consequence, I do not consider me a Dechert lawyer for conflict purposes and I do not see Dechert\u2019s activities, except for the Dechert cases I work on, to be such as to cast any doubt on my independence and impartiality.*\n\n*I am however informing the parties, for the sake of transparency, that Dechert has within the past year been adverse to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and/or Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela in six litigation matters that are entirely unrelated to the present arbitration. I have no additional information on these cases and, for the avoidance of doubt, I of course confirm that I will not participate in any manner in any work of Dechert with respect to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela or any other entity related to the Republic of Venezuela.\"*\n\n7.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, Venezuela advised that Mr. Mourre\u2019s communication of March 4, 2015 cast serious doubts about his suitability as an arbitrator in any of the cases to which Venezuela was a party, and asked for additional information concerning Mr. Mourre\u2019s relationship with Dechert LLP. Specifically, Venezuela requested:\n\n*(a) The date of commencement of the negotiations or talks between Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP, which led to the decision to become part of that firm under the terms disclosed on 4 March 2015.*\n\n*(b) The date when those negotiations or talks concluded and the agreement disclosed on 4 March 2015 was entered into.*\n\n*(c) The particulars of the individuals who participated in those negotiations or talks between Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP, and the place or places where they were conducted.*\n\n*(d) A list of the cases in which Dechert LLP acts as counsel or advisor in \u2014domestic or international\u2014 arbitration or court proceedings against Latin American States or their instrumentalities, including details on the stage of the proceedings, the industry concerned, the subject-matter of the case, the claimant and \u2014in the case of arbitration proceedings\u2014 the institution conducting the proceedings and the names of the members of the tribunal.*\n\n*(e) A description of the functions that Mr. Mourre will carry out as from May of this year, in his role as 'Special Counsel' at Dechert LLP.*\n\n*(f) A list of the team of in-house attorneys and external advisors in which Mr. Mourre will act as legal consultant within Dechert LLP, including the organizational chart on the basis of which he will receive work requests and/or instructions.*\n\n*(g) In the event that this has been discussed during or after his negotiations with Dechert LLP, a list of the cases in which Mr. Mourre will participate, including the industries concerned and the subject-matter of the proceedings.*\n\n8.\n\nOn March 11, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal conveyed the following message from Mr. Mourre to the parties, inviting their comments by March 16, 2015:\n\n*\"...I acknowledge receipt of a communication dated March 9, 2015 from counsel for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in this case. In this communication, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela requests additional information regarding my communication to the parties dated March 4, 2015, stating however that my future professional relationship with Dechert LLP 'is such as to generate conflicts of interest that are not compatible with the requirements that an arbitrator must meet under the ICSID Convention' (arbitrator\u2019s translation). In this regard, I can only confirm that my professional relationship with this law firm - which will only start on May 1rst - is not such as to generate any conflict since, (i) my arbitrator\u2019s work (including in this case) will be totally separated from Dechert, (ii) I will not be a partner in Dechert and I will have no access whatsoever to their databases, (iii) my relationship with Dechert will be limited to specific matters on which Dechert will ask me to participate, and (iv) I will not have any involvement (and information on) in the cases on which Dechert may act against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela or related entities. Therefore, I am unable to provide any information relating to cases in which Dechert may be acting against the Republic or related governmental entities, since I don't have that information and I don't have access to it. I can only add that the conversations that led to the establishment of this professional relationship were informally conducted with Dr. Eduardo Silva Romero, with whom I have a longstanding friendship, and were concluded shortly before I made my declaration. Based on this, I can only confirm my total independence and impartiality. I however understand and respect the position of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In view of the importance attached to all arbitrators having the full confidence of the parties, if the Republic still believes that my statement is not compatible with my duties of independence and impartiality, I will have no choice but to resign as arbitrator in this case...\"*\n\n9.\n\nOn March 13, 2015, Venezuela proposed the disqualification of Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier on the basis that each of them lacked the requisite impartiality and independence under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (the \"**Proposal**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Centre informed the parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural schedule for written submissions on the Proposal.\n\n11.\n\nIn addition, on March 16, 2015, following receipt of a copy of the Proposal, Mr. Mourre submitted his resignation to the other members of the Tribunal and the Secretary-General of ICSID. The ICSID Secretariat immediately communicated Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation to the parties.\n\n12.\n\nFinally, also on March 16, 2015, the Claimants submitted comments to Mr. Mourre\u2019s disclosure of March 11, 2015. These were submitted before the parties had been notified of Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule, the Claimants submitted a Reply to the Proposal on March 24, 2015 (\"**Claimants\u2019 Reply**\"). On March 30, 2015, Mr. Fortier furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n14.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, Venezuela requested a translation into Spanish of the Claimants\u2019 Reply. The Centre invited the Claimants to provide the translation by April 7, 2015, which the Claimants did.\n\n15.\n\nBoth parties submitted additional comments to the Proposal on April 14, 2015 (\"**Additional Comments**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn April 22, 2015, Mr. Fortier, having reviewed the Additional Comments, provided further explanations.\n\n17.\n\nOn April 23, 2015, Venezuela requested an opportunity to comment on Mr. Fortier\u2019s communication of April 22, 2015. Both parties were invited to submit any final comments concerning the Proposal by April 27, 2015, which comments were received by April 27, 2015. On June 11, 2015, Venezuela submitted a further letter to the Centre in connection with the Proposal. The Centre invited the Claimants to provide comments on the letter by June 15, 2015, which the Claimants did.\n\n**C. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY MR. MOURRE AND MR. FORTIER**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Venezuela\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s arguments on the proposal to disqualify Messrs. Mourre and Fortier were set forth in its submissions of March 13, April 14 and 27, and June 11, 2015. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**(i) Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Alexis Mourre**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, Mr. Mourre\u2019s communication of March 11, 2015 contained an incomplete answer to Venezuela\u2019s inquiries,3 and simply reiterated general statements made in his letter of March 4, 2015.4 Venezuela asserts that an arbitrator must \"investigate by all reasonable means available to him the existence of situations of conflict of interest in any firm he or she wishes to join and must disclose all available information as soon as he or she becomes aware of it.\"5 In Venezuela\u2019s view, Mr. Mourre\u2019s explanations failed to provide sufficient details as to his relationship with Dechert LLP,6 a firm that represents interests adverse to Venezuela.7\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Arbitrators Alexis Mourre and Yves Fortier dated March 13, 2015 (\"Proposal\") \u00b66.\n\nProposal \u00b612-13.\n\nProposal \u00b614.\n\nProposal \u00b6\u00b68-9.\n\nProposal \u00b67, 13.\n\n20.\n\nVenezuela raises potential similarities between cases against Venezuela where Dechert LLP acts as counsel and those in which Mr. Mourre sits as an arbitrator.8 Venezuela claims that \"an independent third party would necessarily understand that it is impossible for Mr. Mourre to decide issues with independent judgment in those cases... [without] regard to the positive or adverse consequences that his decisions may have on the interests of the firm for which he now works.\"9\n\nProposal \u00b616.\n\nProposal \u00b616; Venezuela\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b649.\n\n21.\n\nFinally, Venezuela claims that Mr. Mourre\u2019s financial interest in the outcome of the cases against Venezuela handled by Dechert LLP would not be reduced by the fact that he would receive a fixed monetary compensation from that firm.10\n\nProposal \u00b618.\n\n22.\n\nIn Venezuela\u2019s view, the relationship between Mr. Mourre and Dechert LLP is sufficient to lead an impartial third party to reasonably doubt his impartiality and independence.11\n\nProposal \u00b619.\n\n**(ii) Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nVenezuela notes that the law firms of Norton Rose12 and Macleod Dixon LLP agreed to a merger in 2011, which became effective on January 1, 2012. This merger led Venezuela to propose the disqualification of Mr. Fortier on October 5, 2011 in ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30 (the \"***First Conoco Challenge***\")13 on the basis of: (a) Mr. Fortier\u2019s long-standing relationship with Norton Rose; and (b) Macleod Dixon\u2019s repeat representation of interests adverse to Venezuela.14 Mr. Fortier resigned from Norton Rose effective December 31, 2011, but Venezuela claims that it remains unclear whether his \"unofficial professional ties with [Norton Rose] were broken either on or after that date\" (emphasis added).\n\nToday Norton Rose Fulbright, following the merger of Norton Rose with Canada\u2019s Ogilvy Renault LLP and McLeod Dixon LLP and US Fulbright & Jaworski LLP (hereinafter, \"**Norton Rose**\").\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30) (\"**Conoco**\"). Venezuela proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier in *Conoco* on October 5, 2011 (\"the **First Conoco Challenge**\") and on March 11, 2014 (\"the **Second Conoco Challenge**\"). Both disqualification proposals were rejected. On February 6, 2015, Venezuela filed a third proposal for the disqualification of Mr. Fortier in *Conoco* (\"the **Third Conoco Challenge**\"). This latest proposal is currently pending before the Chairman of ICSID Administrative Council.\n\nProposal \u00b6\u00b626-27.\n\n24.\n\nVenezuela states that it became aware that Mr. Fortier continued to \"have strong professional links with Norton Rose\" on January 27, 2015, through press reports that highlighted the participation of Mr. Martin J. Valasek, a Norton Rose partner, as assistant to the tribunal presided over by Mr. Fortier in the *Yukos v. Russian Federation* arbitration. In Venezuela\u2019s view, this demonstrates an ongoing professional relationship between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose.15\n\nProposal \u00b628-29. Venezuela\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b620-25.\n\n25.\n\nOn February 6, 2015, Venezuela filed a third disqualification proposal respecting Mr. Fortier in *Conoco* (the \"***Third Conoco Challenge***\"). Venezuela argues that Mr. Fortier\u2019s alleged conflict of interest in Conoco [concerning Norton Rose] is similar to Mr. Mourre\u2019s alleged conflict of interest in this case [concerning Dechert LLP]. Venezuela submits that, given these similarities, it became necessary to propose the disqualification of Mr. Fortier in the present case, since Mr. Mourre\u2019s eventual resignation would have been considered by Prof. Shin and Mr. Fortier [who, in Venezuela\u2019s view, is conflicted] under Article 56 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2).16\n\nProposal \u00b623-24.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition, Venezuela: (a) notes that Mr. Fortier\u2019s offices \"are located in the reception area of Norton Rose, at the same building, on the same floor [\u2026] physical proximity [that] would make an impartial observer assume that Mr. Fortier is in regular contact [with] Norton Rose;\"17 (b) alleges that Mr. Fortier still serves as *Chairman Emeritus* of Norton Rose, based on a hyperlink that allegedly leads to Norton Rose\u2019s website;18 (c) referring to the same hyperlink, notes the existence of the email address *yves.fortier@nortonrosefulbright.com*, which must have been created after December 2011, since the merger of Norton Rose and Fulbright & Jaworski only became effective in June 2013;19 and (d) refers to Mr. Fortier\u2019s public endorsement of the political candidacy of Ms. Rachel Bendayan, a current Norton Rose lawyer.20\n\nProposal \u00b630. Venezuela\u2019s Additional Observations \u00b626.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Additional Observations \u00b619.\n\n*Ibid.* Venezuela attaches as Annex II a reference to the e-mail address of Mr. Yves Fortier, identified as yves.fortier@nortonrosefulbright.com.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated April 27, 2015, page 5. Venezuela attaches as Annex VI a public statement made by Mr. Fortier, as stated in Ms. Bendayan\u2019s website.\n\n27.\n\nGiven these links, Venezuela alleges that, \"any impartial third-party [would] have reasonable and justifiable doubts on whether Mr. Fortier would decide the cases to which [\u2026] Venezuela is a party with independence and impartiality, as he will have to decide on issues [\u2026] which have a direct impact on the economic interests of [Norton Rose] and its clients.\"21\n\nProposal \u00b632.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 arguments on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier were set forth in their submissions of March 24, April 14 and April 27, 2015. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**(i) Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Alexis Mourre**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants submit that: (a) there has been no inappropriate non-disclosure by Mr. Mourre;22(b) M. Mourre made arrangements to ensure that his future relationship with Dechert LLP would not subvert his integrity in these and other proceedings;23 and (c) nothing in the facts disclosed by Mr. Mourre indicates an evident or obvious inability to exercise independence or an appearance of lack of impartiality.24\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b643. Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations \u00b620.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Additional Observations \u00b620.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b638\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that, even if genuinely held, the subjective belief of the Respondent cannot constitute a basis for disqualification.25\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b644.\n\n**(ii) Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants observe that \"the Respondent has unambiguously recognized that the true reason behind the challenge to Mr. Fortier was to prevent him from considering a potential resignation from Mr. Mourre.\"26 According to the Claimants, this is not a valid ground for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, nor are the Respondent\u2019s previous unsuccessful attempts to disqualify Mr. Fortier.27\n\nClaimants\u2019 Additional Comments \u00b611. Claimants\u2019 Reply \u00b647-48.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b650.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants also note that Mr. Fortier informed the *Conoco* tribunal and parties in 2011 that he would continue working with members of Norton Rose on certain files in which he was sitting as an arbitrator, and that the *Conoco* tribunal had rejected the *First Conoco Challenge*, knowing that Mr. Fortier would continue to have a relationship with some members of Norton Rose.28 In addition, the Claimants submit that the relationship between Messrs. Valasek and Fortier cannot evidence a manifest lack of the requisite independence or impartiality of the latter under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.29\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b652. Claimants\u2019 Additional Comments \u00b612 (ii).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b654.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants further state that Venezuela has offered no explanation as to \"why Mr. Fortier\u2019s choice of an office in proximity to the office of a law firm entirely uninvolved in this case would undermine his ability to fulfill his role as arbitrator in these proceedings.\"30\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b656. Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations \u00b612 (iii).\n\n34.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that \"ICSID jurisprudence has confirmed consistently that professional contacts between an arbitrator and legal counsel cannot, without more, be considered grounds for automatic disqualification.\" They conclude that Mr. Fortier\u2019s relationship with Norton Rose \"cannot cast any plausible doubt on Mr. Fortier\u2019s independence or impartiality, let alone establish the 'manifest' lack of these qualities that is required for a challenge to succeed in ICSID proceedings.\"31\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b657. Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations \u00b613.\n\n**D. EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY THE ARBITRATORS**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nFollowing Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation on March 16, 2015, he ceased to be a member of the Tribunal and thus furnished no explanation.\n\n36.\n\nBy communication of March 30, 2015, Mr. Fortier declared the following:\n\n*\"The Respondent in this arbitration has requested my disqualification in its letter of 13 March 2015 to the Secretary of the Tribunal.*\n\n*I note that the Respondent has attached to its request as Annex 1 what it describes in footnote 9 as the \"Conoco Disqualification\", being a proposal for my disqualification also on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the ICSID Case of ConocoPhillips Company and Others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30 which is still pending. I am surprised to see this explicit reference to a proceeding which I believe to be confidential. For your information, I have submitted explanations to my coarbitrators and the parties in that proceeding which I would be happy to provide to you if you wish (subject to the parties\u2019 consent).*\n\n*To assist you in considering the Respondent\u2019s request, I offer the following explanations in respect of the Respondent\u2019s allegations which concern me (pages 11 to 15):*\n\n*1. The Respondent alleges that after 31 December 2011, I have \"continued to have strong professional links with Norton Rose \" (para. 28. See also paras. 29 and 32) and that I \"now serve as \"Chairman Emeritus\" of Norton Rose OR\" (para. 26) (my emphasis).*\n\n*This is wrong. I deny categorically that allegation of Respondent. It is a matter of public record that I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR on 31 December 2011 and severed all of my professional links with that firm on that date. My profile referenced in footnote 10 of the Respondent\u2019s request is a CV which was published some time in 2011 when I was still Chairman Emeritus of Norton Rose OR. For your information, Norton Rose OR ceased to exist on 31 December 2011. If one visits the website of Norton Rose Fulbright, http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com (as I have just done), one sees no reference to L. Yves Fortier and this has been so since 1 January 2012. You may also wish to consult the website of Cabinet Yves Fortier at http://www.yfortier.ca.*\n\n*2. Referring to the Yukos v. Russia awards and the role that Mr. Martin Valasek fulfilled as assistant to these tribunals, the Respondent alleges \"that it shows the existence of a current professional link between Mr. Fortier and [Norton Rose]\" (para. 29).*\n\n*With respect, the role that Mr. Valasek, a former colleague at Norton Rose OR, continued to play as assistant to the Yukos tribunals after 31 December 2011 shows no such thing.*\n\n*It is a matter of public record that Mr. Valasek was appointed as assistant to the Yukos Tribunals in 2005, with the consent of my co-arbitrators and the parties, and that he served in that capacity for nearly 10 years until the Final Awards were issued on 18 July 2014.*\n\n*After I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP on 31 December 2011 in order to pursue my career as an independent arbitrator and mediator, Mr. Valasek continued to perform his duties as assistant to the Yukos tribunals until the Final Awards were issued.*\n\n*Whatever may have been written in recent press reports does not change the fact that, after 1 January 2012 and until 18 July 2014, Mr. Valasek, in the Yukos arbitrations, continued to assist the tribunals as he had done since 2005.*\n\n*3. The Respondent alleges that my \"current offices are located in the reception area of Norton Rose, at the same building, on the same floor [...] and that this is in conflict with the statements made by Mr. Fortier to the Republic when informing it about his resignation from Norton Rose with a view to avoiding a previous disqualification\" (para. 30).*\n\n*Place Ville Marie is the largest office building in Montreal. It has 41 floors and each floor has four separate, distinct wings. There are more than ten law firms in this building.*\n\n*My Montreal office, since 1 January 2012, is situated in the North wing of the 28th floor. The Montreal offices of Navigant Consulting are also in this wing. Norton Rose Fulbright has a mail room (not a reception area which is on the 25th floor) in the South wing and a cafeteria for its employees in the East wing. The West wing was leased very recently to Tory\u2019s LLP, a major Canadian law firm.*\n\n*These facts are not in conflict with any other statement I may have made previously to other counsel for the Republic in other disqualification proceedings.*\n\n*I hope that these explanations will be of assistance to you as you consider the pending proposal for my disqualification. I reiterate my profound conviction that I am, always have been, and will remain able to exercise independent judgment in this arbitration. \"*\n\n37.\n\nBy communication of April 22, 2015, Mr. Fortier declared the following:\n\n*\"I have now seen the English translation of the Respondent\u2019s \"comments on [my] comments of 30 March 2015\" for which I thank the Respondent\u2019s counsel.*\n\n*With your leave, I wish to clarify a few important facts in the Respondent\u2019s comments:*\n\n*In paragraph 19, the Respondent refers to and files as Annex II my alleged current profile found through a web search engine such as Google (not through the current Norton Rose Fulbright website, http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com). In order to be fair, I need to complete and clarify this Annex II by submitting (i) the full Google search results page for \"Yves Fortier Norton Rose Fulbright\" (as Annex 1) and (ii) the second search result on that page, being the announcement issued by Norton Rose OR on 21 October 2011 entitled \"Revered international arbitrator, Yves Fortier, leaving Norton Rose OR to establish independent practice \" (as Annex 2).*\n\n*To be clear, I reconfirm in its entirety the statement I made at paragraph number 1 of my comments of 30 March 2015.*\n\n*The email address, yves.fortier@nortonrosefulbright.com referred to in paragraph 19, is not today, and has never been, active.*\n\n*In paragraph 26, the Respondent refers to me as \"a former Managing Partner\". In fact, I have never been a \"Managing Partner \" of Norton Rose OR or any one of its predecessor firms. I served as the non-executive Chairman of the firm from 1992 to 2009.\"*\n\n**E. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The proposed disqualification of Mr. Alexis Mourre**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nMr. Mourre resigned from the Tribunal. As a result, it is no longer necessary to address the proposal for his disqualification, which is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**2. The proposed disqualification of Mr. Yves Fortier**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nProposals for the disqualification of an arbitrator under the ICSID Convention and Rules must be submitted promptly. Arbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n40.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case-by-case basis.32\n\nSee *Conoco supra* note 13, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal of May 5, 2014 \u00b639, footnote 26.\n\n41.\n\nIn this case, Venezuela filed the Proposal on March 13, 2015, following Mr. Mourre\u2019s disclosures of March 4 and March 11, 2015.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Venezuela did not file the Proposal *promptly*, and thereby waived its right to seek Mr. Fortier\u2019s disqualification under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.33 The Claimants state that Venezuela learned of the basis for the Proposal as early as October 201134 and that, in any event, should have been aware of the relationship between Messrs. Fortier and Valasek by July 2014, when the *Yukos* award was made public *.*35\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b660.

It admits that it became aware of Mr. Fortier\u2019s alleged continued professional links with Norton Rose on January 27, 2015 through public media reports on the *Yukos* case.36 However, Venezuela claims that the promptness of this disqualification proposal ought to be considered by looking at the specific circumstances that motivated the proposal.37 Venezuela concedes that it knew all facts relevant to its proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier by January 2015, but argues that the relevant date to assess promptness of the proposal should be set as March 11, 2015, when it realized Mr. Fortier would have had to consider the resignation of Mr. Mourre.38\n\nProposal \u00b628.

Therefore, the Proposal is rejected.\n\n**F. CONCLUSIONS**\n------------------\n\n47.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Chairman decides as follows:\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr. Alexis Mourre pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is dismissed;\n\n2. Respondent\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is rejected as untimely."}, {"Title": "Reasoned Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Arbitrator L.

THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimants are F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A., two companies incorporated under the laws of Venezuela, which are owned and controlled by a Dutch corporation1 (jointly, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\nAccording to the July 2012 Request for Arbitration, the Claimants are controlled by OI European Group B.V. (\"**OIEG**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"**Venezuela**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\"). On 10 August 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on February 14, 2013, and comprised Professor Hi-Taek Shin, a national of Korea, appointed as president pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, appointed by the Claimants, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session in Paris, France. During the session a number of procedural matters were decided, including a schedule for pleadings. In accordance with the schedule: (i) the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits on July 15, 2013; (ii) the Respondent filed a request to address objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter on August 16, 20132; (iii) the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits on December 20, 2013; (iv) the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on March 21, 2014; (v) the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and a Reply on Jurisdiction on June 20, 2014; and (vi) the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on August 21, 2014. A hearing on jurisdiction and merits was scheduled to be held in Paris, from March 30 through April 3, 2015.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 2 of September 23, 2013 the Tribunal declined Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 13, 2015, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier on the basis that each of them lacked the requisite impartiality and independence under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (\"**First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the First Proposal for Disqualification was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural schedule for written submissions on the First Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n9.\n\nIn addition, on March 16, 2015, following receipt of a copy of the Proposal, Mr. Mourre submitted his resignation to the other members of the Tribunal and the Secretary-General of ICSID. The Centre immediately communicated Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation to the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 19, 2015, Prof. Shin informed the Parties that, in view of the pending challenge, the dates for the upcoming hearing were vacated, and that new hearing dates would be fixed as soon as possible after the resumption of the proceeding.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (i) rejected as untimely the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Yves Fortier, and (ii) dismissed, in view of Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation, the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Alexis Mourre (\"**Decision on the First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), the Tribunal consented to the resignation of Mr. Alexis Mourre.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the Respondent appointed Prof. Zachary Douglas QC, a national of Australia, as arbitrator, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1).\n\n14.\n\nOn August 5, 2015, the Centre (i) notified the Parties of Prof. Douglas\u2019 acceptance of his appointment as an arbitrator, and (ii) informed the Parties that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 12, the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceeding resumed as of that date from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy occurred.\n\n15.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, following an exchange of communication with the Parties, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing on jurisdiction and merits had been rescheduled and that this hearing would now be held in Paris, France, from April 4 through April 8, 2016.\n\n16.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the \"**Proposal**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn March 7, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Proposal.\n\n18.\n\nOn that same date, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Douglas (the \"**Two Members**\"), set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants filed a submission on March 9, 2016 (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Reply of March 9, 2016**\") and Mr. Fortier furnished his explanations on March 11, 2016 (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 11, 2016**\").\n\n20.\n\nOn March 15, 2016, both Parties submitted additional observations on the Proposal (\"**Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments**\" and \"**Claimants\u2019 Additional Comments**\", respectively).\n\n21.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, the Two Members informed the Parties that the Proposal was rejected. The Two Members indicated that they had decided to communicate their Decision to the Parties, with the full reasons for that Decision to follow as soon as possible, in view of the proximity of the hearing scheduled from April 4 to 8, 2016.\n\n22.\n\nThe present document includes the reasons of the Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Mr. L. Yves Fortier as Arbitrator issued by the Two Members on March 21, 2016, and the Two Members\u2019 decision on costs.\n\n**C. THE TWO MEMBERS' REASONS FOR REJECTING THE PROPOSAL TO DISQUALIFY MR. FORTIER**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Two Members first set out their analysis of the legal standard that must be applied to an application for the disqualification of an arbitrator and then consider each of the Respondent\u2019s two grounds for requesting the disqualification of Mr. Fortier.\n\n24.\n\nThe Two Members have resolved to deal with the substantive grounds that are advanced by the Respondent in its Proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier in this case notwithstanding the admissibility objection raised by the Claimants in relation to the timeliness of the Respondent\u2019s Proposal. As the decision of the Two Members is to reject the Respondent\u2019s Proposal on the merits, the Two Members need not rule upon the Claimants\u2019 admissibility objection.3\n\nRecalling that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council rejected the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for Disqualification as untimely, the Two Members limit their review to the two grounds which are based upon the \"new\" information the Respondent claims that it recently learned from a specialized publication on February 16, 2016.\n\n**1. The Legal Standard for the Disqualification of an Arbitrator**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Proposal is based upon Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.\n\n26.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.*\n\n27.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n28.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions*\" (guaranteed independence in exercising their functions), the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.4\n\nConocoPhillips Company et al. v.

As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.*8\n\nProposal, \u00b649.\n\nBlue Bank supra note 4, \u00b660.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants also state that the applicable legal standard is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party\".9\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of March 9, 2016, \u00b614.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, regarding the meaning of the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the Convention, a number of decisions have concluded that it means \"evident\" or \"obvious\"10 and it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of qualities can be perceived.11\n\nConoco supra note 4, \u00b671; Abaclat supra note 4, \u00b671, footnote 25; Burlington supra note 4 \u00b668, footnote 83; Blue Bank supra note 4, \u00b661, footnote 43; Repsol supra note 4 \u00b673, footnote 58.\n\nC.

Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b653 and 54.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s First Ground for Disqualification: Mr. Fortier\u2019s Alleged Relationship with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Mr. Fortier has maintained a relationship with the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP since his resignation from Norton Rose OR and that the existence of such a relationship would cause a reasonable third party to conclude that Mr. Fortier is incapable of exercising impartial and independent judgment in this arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent draws this conclusion on the basis that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP acts for a number of clients in litigation against the Respondent and parties related to the Respondent. The Respondent further maintains that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is involved in litigation before the courts in Venezuela relating to the present proceedings (but this is flatly denied by the Claimants).13\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is acting for a company called UNIMIN in this domestic litigation \"aiming to challenge certain aspects of the measures taken by the Republic\" in connection with the expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 assets in the country (Proposal, \u00b635). The Claimants replied by attesting that neither UNIMIN nor Norton Rose Fulbright LLP \"have any connection whatsoever with either the Claimants or the Claimants\u2019 counsel\" and that that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP\u2019s participation in the local expropriation proceedings \"has been limited to pointing out the Respondent\u2019s error and requesting that the expropriation request in relation to UNIMIN be dismissed.\" (Claimants\u2019 Reply of March 9, 2016 \u00b6\u00b622 and 23). The Two Members obviously cannot resolve this question in the present context save to note that the Respondent\u2019s assertion, even if its veracity is assumed, cannot possibly have an impact on the ability of Mr. Fortier to exercise impartial and independent judgment for the reasons contained in this section of our Decision.\n\n37.\n\nNorton Rose Fulbright LLP came into existence on January 1, 2012 as a result of a merger between Norton Rose OR and Macleod Dixon LLP on January 1, 2012. It was Macleod Dixon LLP that, according to the Respondent, was \"*due to the nature of its litigation practice and its client portfolio, one of the most active firms in the representation of interests contrary to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the state-owned company PDVSA, both within and without Venezuela*\".14 According to the Respondent, Norton Rose Fulbright LLP has since absorbed this portfolio of clients with interests adverse to the Respondent following the merger with Macleod Dixon LLP.\n\nProposal, \u00b64.\n\n38.\n\nMr. Fortier was a lawyer at the firm Ogilvy Renault for more than 50 years. On June 1, 2011, Ogilvy Renault was renamed Norton Rose OR following a merger. Mr. Fortier resigned from Norton Rose OR on December 31, 2011. The merger with Macleod Dixon LLP was then consummated on January 1, 2012. The new firm later became known as Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.15 These facts are a matter of public record and are confirmed by a press release issued by Norton Rose OR on October 21, 2011.16\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 11, 2016. The merger between Norton Rose OR and Fulbright Jaworski LLP became effective on June 3, 2013. Proposal, \u00b66 footnote 13.\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 11, 2016, \u00b6A.2.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent nonetheless maintains that \"*Mr. Fortier has continued to have professional relations with the law [firm] Norton Rose Fulbright LLP even after his supposed disengagement from it*\".17 The Respondent\u2019s evidence for these continued \"*professional relations*\" is the fact that Mr. Fortier has relied upon the services of lawyers employed at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP as assistants to tribunals in cases in which he has served as the presiding arbitrator. The new fact relied upon by the Respondent to justify the filing of the present challenge to Mr. Fortier is a press article18 that reveals that in one such case, *von Pezold v. Zimbabw* e (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), a lawyer for Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, Ms. Alison FitzGerald, was formally engaged as an assistant to an ICSID Tribunal over which Mr. Fortier was presiding after Mr. Fortier had resigned from Norton Rose OR. According to the Respondent, this fact demonstrates that Mr. Fortier continued to have a professional relationship with the firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP (the entity that absorbed the firm Macleod Dixon LLP) even after his resignation from Norton Rose OR on December 31, 2011. Furthermore, the Respondent maintains that this appointment after the resignation of Mr. Fortier from Norton Rose OR cannot be explained on the basis that it was expedient to ensure the continuity of an assistant to the tribunal that had been appointed prior to Mr. Fortier\u2019s resignation.19\n\nProposal, \u00b61 (a).\n\nProposal, \u00b61; Lacey Yong and Alison Ross, \"Zimbabwe must return farms, tribunal rules\", Global Arbitration Review, February 16, 2016.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b625.\n\n40.\n\nThe Award in *von Pezold v. Zimbabwe* records the following:\n\n*Following a proposal by the Tribunal during the Joint First Session that Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault serve as assistant to the Tribunals in these two proceedings, and the Parties\u2019 subsequent agreement thereto, Ms. Th\u00e9riault was appointed to serve as Assistant to the two Tribunals. In February 2012, with the agreement of the Parties, Ms. Alison FitzGerald replaced Ms. Th\u00e9riault to serve as Assistant to the two Tribunals.20*\n\nBernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), Award (July 28, 2015), \u00b621.\n\n41.\n\nMs. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault was also a lawyer at Norton Rose OR.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s case is that the formal appointment of Ms. Alison FitzGerald as assistant to the ICSID Tribunal in *von Pezold v Zimbabwe*after Mr. Fortier\u2019s resignation from Norton Rose OR evidences that Mr. Fortier has continued to have a professional relationship with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP despite his affirmation that he \"*severed all of [his] professional links with Norton Rose OR as of December 31, 2011*\".21 This is coupled with the continued assistance provided by two other lawyers at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP to tribunals over which Mr. Fortier is the presiding arbitrator since his resignation from Norton Rose OR.22\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of March 11, 2016, \u00b6A.2.\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b610-11;\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent is asking the Two Members to infer, based upon the fact that Mr. Fortier was able to procure the formal appointment of Ms. Alison FitzGerald as an assistant to the aforementioned ICSID Tribunal after his resignation from Norton Rose OR, and the fact that two other lawyers from Norton Rose Fulbright LLP continued to act in that capacity, that Mr. Fortier must continue to have a relationship with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP of some nature.\n\n44.\n\nThe Two Members consider that it is reasonable to infer that there was an understanding between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose OR (that evidently was not repudiated when Norton Rose OR became Norton Rose Fulbright LLP) that lawyers of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP serving as assistants to tribunals over which he was presiding could continue to serve in that capacity after the departure of Mr. Fortier from Norton Rose OR. This understanding evidently extended to replacing Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault, who had indicated to Mr. Fortier before he had resigned from Norton Rose OR that she would not be able to continue to assist the Tribunal in the *von Pezold v Zimbabwe* case (see Part 3 of the Decision below).\n\n45.\n\nBut the critical question then must be confronted: why would the existence of such an understanding between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP cause a reasonable third person to conclude that Mr. Fortier is incapable of exercising independent and impartial judgment in this case?\n\n46.\n\nIt does not assist the Respondent\u2019s case to characterize the aforementioned understanding as a \"*relationship*\". What is important is whether that understanding, whether or not it is characterized as a relationship, could be interpreted by a reasonable third person as capable of influencing Mr. Fortier\u2019s judgment in the present case. A \"*relationship*\" can encompass a spectrum of possible connections between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, some of which would cause no reasonable third person to doubt for an instant that Mr. Fortier were capable of exercising independent and impartial judgment, and others which would inexorably result in Mr. Fortier\u2019s disqualification. At one end of the spectrum, if Mr. Fortier retained personal friendships with some of the lawyers at the firm at which he practiced for over 50 years, which would hardly be surprising, this could not result in his disqualification. Likewise, if Mr. Fortier is a tenant of the same office building as Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, together with other law firms and companies as would appear to be the case, then this might also be described as a relationship but not a material one for the purposes of adjudging Mr. Fortier\u2019s ability to act independently and impartially. In contradistinction, if Mr. Fortier were to continue to receive a share of the profits generated by Norton Rose OR (now Norton Rose Fulbright LLP) following his resignation, would cause a reasonable third person to entertain doubts about Mr. Fortier\u2019s impartiality. That is because Mr. Fortier in that situation would have a direct financial interest in the activities of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, which include acting against the Respondent in international and domestic proceedings. But no financial interest on the part of Mr. Fortier has even been alleged and Mr. Fortier\u2019s affirmation that he severed all professional ties with Norton Rose OR on December 31, 2011 rules out any such financial interest.\n\n47.\n\nAt its highest the Respondent\u2019s case is that a relationship persists between Norton Rose Fulbright LLP and Mr. Fortier as evidenced by the continued services rendered by three lawyers at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP to tribunals over which Mr. Fortier presided following his resignation from Norton Rose OR. But how would such a relationship possibly incentivize Mr. Fortier to act partially against the interests of the Respondent in this case?\n\n48.\n\nThe relevant circumstances are as follows:\n\n\u2022 In the previous cases, Mr. Fortier had no financial interest in the services rendered by the lawyers at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP to the tribunals in question: they sent invoices directly to ICSID for their work.\n\n\u2022 Those lawyers did not act as assistants to tribunals in which the Respondent was a party.\n\n\u2022 In each of the cases in which those lawyers did serve as assistants to the tribunals, the parties would have had an opportunity to object to the appointments by virtue of their relationship to the firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP but evidently did not do so.\n\n\u2022 In the present case, Mr. Fortier is not the presiding arbitrator and no assistant, in addition to the ICSID Secretary, has been appointed to serve the tribunal.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \"*Norton Rose has economic interests relating to the success or failure of the arguments put forward by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in its international proceedings (including those where the claimants are represented by different law firms)*\".23 That may or may not be so depending on the terms on which Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is acting for clients against the Respondent or parties related to the Respondent. But on what basis could a reasonable third person conclude that the assistance of three lawyers of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP to tribunals over which Mr. Fortier presided following his resignation from Norton Rose OR means that Mr. Fortier\u2019s interests are sufficiently aligned with the interests of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP such that Mr. Fortier cannot be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment in this case? At no point in the Respondent\u2019s lengthy submissions does the Respondent attempt to answer this question and that is fatal to its first ground for requesting the disqualification of Mr. Fortier.\n\nProposal, \u00b64\n\n**3. The Respondent\u2019s Second Ground for Disqualification: Mr. Fortier\u2019s Alleged False Declaration Concerning the Appointment of Ms. Alison FitzGerald as an Assistant to the Tribunal in** ***von Pezold v Zimbabwe***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent refers to Mr. Fortier\u2019s declarations in response to the Respondent\u2019s applications to disqualify him in *Conoco v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30) and submits that those declarations were false in light of what is now known about the timing of Ms. Alison FitzGerald\u2019s appointment in the *von Pezold v Zimbabwe* case.\n\n51.\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s declaration of April 16, 2015 reads, in relevant part:\n\n*Ms. FitzGerald was appointed as Assistant to the Tribunals prior to December 31, 2011 when she was the very junior lawyer with Ogilvy Renault. After I resigned from Norton Rose, it also made good practical and financial sense to have her continue as Assistant to these ICSID tribunals. Since January 1, 2012, Ms. FitzGerald has billed ICSID directly for her work as Assistant to these Tribunals.24*\n\nProposal, \u00b622; Explanations from Mr. Yves Fortier, dated April 16, 2015, \u00b618.\n\n52.\n\nMr. Fortier refers to \"Tribunals\" in the plural because there were two related cases involving Zimbabwe that proceeded in parallel and Ms. FitzGerald was appointed to serve as an assistant to both those Tribunals.\n\n53.\n\nAs the extract from the award in *von Pezold v Zimbabwe* reveals (quoted at paragraph 40, above), Ms. FitzGerald was formally appointed as assistant to that Tribunal in February 2012. The Respondent maintains that this is highly relevant because it contradicts Mr. Fortier\u2019s earlier declaration of April 16, 2015 in *Conoco v. Venezuela*.\n\n54.\n\nIn the context of a further challenge to Mr. Fortier in *Conoco v Venezuela*, Mr. Fortier provided the following explanation of this discrepancy in the dates on February 26, 2016:\n\n*1. Upon my recommendation to my co-arbitrators, Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault of the Ottawa office of Ogilvy Renault was appointed, with the consent of the parties, as assistant to the two tribunals when they were constituted.*\n\n*2. Ms. Ren\u00e9e Th\u00e9riault fulfilled her duties as assistant to these tribunals until midDecember 2011 when she informed me that she had decided to leave active practice at the end of the month and join the Supreme Court of Canada as a research assistant.*\n\n*3. I thus recommended to my co-arbitrators that Ms. Th\u00e9riault be replaced by her colleague, Ms. Alison Fitzgerald, also a young lawyer at the Ottawa office of Ogilvy Renault with whom I had worked previously.*\n\n*4. My co-arbitrators readily endorsed my recommendation before the end of December 2011.*\n\n*5. As you will recall, I resigned as a partner at Ogilvy Renault effective 31 December 2011 and at that time was making arrangements to leave my office and pursue my career as an independent arbitrator. There were thus a number of matters, such as the formalization of Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s appointment as a successor to Ms. Th\u00e9riault, which I did not consider pressing. Accordingly, those matters went on a list of \"things to do\" in early 2012.*\n\n*6. At the end of an extended Christmas vacation, on 2 February 2012, through the secretary of the tribunals, I informed the parties of Ms. Th\u00e9riault\u2019s departure from active practice in December and proposed, on behalf of the tribunals, that her former colleague at Ogilvy Renault (at that time Norton Rose OR), Ms. Alison Fitzgerald, be appointed in her place and stead subject to the same terms and conditions. All parties agreed and I note that the formalization of Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s appointment took place in February 2012.*\n\n55.\n\nIn its Proposal, the Respondent quotes this passage of Mr. Fortier\u2019s declaration in full and then makes the following statement:\n\n*This explanation is very unsatisfactory. In fact, it is hardly an explanation at all. Confronted with the incontestable character of the discovered facts denounced by the Republic, Mr. Fortier cannot but confirm that he lied to the Republic when, on April 16th 2015, he explained the circumstances of Ms. FitzGerald appointment and why he believed her continuity in the position did not impaired his impartiality regarding the Republic.*25\n\nProposal, \u00b621.\n\n56.\n\nIn contradistinction with the Respondent, the Two Members find Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanation concerning the discrepancy of dates to be entirely satisfactory.\n\n57.\n\nIf an arbitrator, when facing an application for disqualification, were found to have deliberately concealed or misrepresented a fact in a declaration to the parties, then such conduct would provide a conclusive justification for the disqualification of the arbitrator. In the present case, however, there is simply no basis whatsoever to infer from the circumstances of Mr. Fortier\u2019s declaration of April 16, 2015 in *Conoco v. Venezuela* that Mr. Fortier had sought to conceal the formal date of Ms. FitzGerald\u2019s appointment as assistant to the Tribunal in *von Pezold v. Zimbabwe* or that he had sought to misrepresent the circumstances of that appointment. A reasonable third party would conclude that there was an interval between Mr. Fortier\u2019s proposal to his co-arbitrators to appoint Ms. FitzGerald to replace Ms. Th\u00e9riault as assistant to the Tribunal and the formal appointment of Ms. FitzGerald to that role and that Mr. Fortier had mistakenly conflated those two dates in his declaration of April 16, 2015. A reasonable third party would take additional comfort from the fact that the information provided by Mr. Fortier in both his aforementioned declarations in *Conoco v. Venezuela* was actually immaterial to an assessment of Mr. Fortier\u2019s ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment. There was, in other words, no conceivable incentive for Mr. Fortier to conceal or misrepresent the facts of Ms. FitzGerald\u2019s appointment. For the reasons elucidated in respect of the Respondent\u2019s First Ground for Disqualification, whether Ms. FitzGerald was formally appointed in December 2011 before Mr. Fortier resigned from Norton Rose OR, or in February 2012 and therefore after Norton Rose Fulbright LLP had come to existence, these facts would not give pause to a reasonable third party about the ability of Mr. Fortier to exercise independent or impartial judgment. For these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s Second Ground for Disqualification must also be rejected.\n\n**D. COSTS**\n------------\n\n58.\n\nAs this Respondent\u2019s Proposal for the disqualification of Mr. Fortier was wholly without merit, the Two Members have decided that the Respondent shall be responsible for the costs associated with the Proposal and that an order to that effect will be made in the award to be issued by the Tribunal in these proceedings.\n\n**E. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n59.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Two Members:\n\n(1) Decide to reject the Proposal made by the Respondent to disqualify Mr. Yves Fortier as arbitrator, as indicated in the Secretariat\u2019s letter of March 21, 2016, and\n\n(2) Decide that the Respondent shall be responsible for the costs associated with the Proposal and that an order to that effect will be made in the award to be issued by the Tribunal in these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Third Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator L.

(\"**OIEG**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"**Venezuela**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\"). On August 10, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on February 14, 2013, and comprised Professor Hi-Taek Shin, a national of Korea, appointed as president pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, appointed by the Claimants, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session in Paris, France. During the session a number of procedural matters were decided, including a schedule for pleadings. In accordance with the schedule: (i) the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits on July 15, 2013; (ii) the Respondent filed a request to address objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter on August 16, 20132; (iii) the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits on December 20, 2013; (iv) the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on March 21, 2014; (v) the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and a Reply on Jurisdiction on June 20, 2014; and (vi) the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 21 August 2014. A hearing on jurisdiction and merits was scheduled to be held in Paris, from March 30 through April 3, 2015.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 2 of September 23, 2013 the Tribunal declined Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 13, 2015, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier on the basis that each of them lacked the requisite impartiality and independence under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (\"**First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the First Proposal for Disqualification was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural schedule for written submissions on the First Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n9.\n\nIn addition, on March 16, 2015, following receipt of a copy of the Proposal, Mr. Mourre submitted his resignation to the other members of the Tribunal and the Secretary-General of ICSID. The Centre immediately communicated Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation to the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 19, 2015, Prof. Shin informed the Parties that, in view of the pending challenge, the dates for the upcoming hearing were vacated, and that new hearing dates would be fixed as soon as possible after the resumption of the proceeding.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (i) rejected as untimely the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Yves Fortier, and (ii) dismissed, in view of Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation, the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Alexis Mourre (\"**Decision on the First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), the Tribunal consented to the resignation of Mr. Alexis Mourre.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the Respondent appointed Prof. Zachary Douglas QC, a national of Australia, as arbitrator, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1).\n\n14.\n\nOn August 5, 2015, the Centre (i) notified the Parties of Prof. Douglas\u2019 acceptance of his appointment as an arbitrator, and (ii) informed the Parties that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 12, the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceeding resumed as of that date from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy occurred.\n\n15.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, following an exchange of communication with the Parties, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing on jurisdiction and merits had been rescheduled and that this hearing would now be held in Paris, France, from April 4 through April 8, 2016.\n\n16.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the \"**Second Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn March 7, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Second Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n18.\n\nOn that same date, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Douglas (the \"**Two Members**\"), set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n19.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, the Two Members informed the Parties that the Second Proposal for Disqualification was rejected. The Two Members indicated that they had decided to communicate their decision to the Parties, with the full reasons for that decision to follow as soon as possible, in view of the proximity of the hearing scheduled from April 4 to 8, 2016. On March 28, 2016, the reasoned decision of the Two Members was transmitted to the Parties (\"**Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n20.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum took place in Paris, France, from April 4 to April 8, 2016.\n\n21.\n\nOn June 4, 2016, the Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs.\n\n22.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, the Parties filed their submissions on costs.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of July 8, 2016, the Respondent informed the Secretary of the Tribunal that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje had accessed to the Box folder of the present case and that, according to her Ms. Ntashamaje LinkedIn account, she \"has been working since August 2013 until the present day as an attorney in the international arbitration practice of the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\" The Respondent requested to be informed of the reasons why Ms. Ntashamaje had access to the case\u2019s documents and on what basis she had such access.\n\n24.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, Mr. Fortier asked the Centre to transmit to the Parties and to the Two Members a letter providing explanations to the questions posed by Respondent in its July 8, 2016 letter (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of July 22, 2016**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the \"**Third Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn July 26, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Third Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n27.\n\nOn August 2, 2016, the Two Members set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations. In accordance with such timetable, the Claimants filed a submission on August 5, 2016 (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016**\") and Mr. Fortier furnished his explanations on August 8, 2016 (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of August 8, 2016**\").\n\n28.\n\nOn August 12, 2016, both Parties submitted additional observations on the Third Proposal for Disqualification (\"**Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments**\" and \"**Claimants\u2019 Additional Comments**\", respectively).\n\n**C. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Venezuela\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nVenezuela argues that Mr. Fortier should be disqualified in light of the two following facts: (i) Mr. Fortier employs as an assistant Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje, who in her LinkedIn profile claims to have worked at the firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP since August 2013; and (ii) Ms. Ntashamaje, as well as Mr. Fortier\u2019s secretary Ms. Linda Tucci,3 receive their salary and other employment benefits from the company Services OR LP/SEC, an entity set up by Norton Rose OR LLP (now Norton Rose Fulbright LLP), for the purpose of providing staff and administrative support services to Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\n\nAnd also Mr. Fortier\u2019s former Secretary Ms. Chantal Robichaud until July 2013.\n\n30.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, these two facts prove the existence of a professional and contractual link between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP. Such link \"provides major financial benefits to Mr. Fortier, as he obtains a significant comparative advantage by being able to manage the benefits of his employees at Cabinet Fortier through a company operating at a much larger scale with the employees of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\"4 Venezuela further argues that \"it cannot be assumed\u2014and, in any event, Mr. Fortier has not provided any sort of evidence to prove it\u2014that Mr. Fortier obtains [such] financial benefit [...] without giving anything in return, free of charge.\"5\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b614. See also, Third Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b67.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b614.\n\n31.\n\nVenezuela contends that, contrary to what is stated in the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* Challenge Decision VI,6 Services OR LP/SEC is not an independent company in which Norton Rose Fulbright LLP and Cabinet Fortier merely coincide as clients. Venezuela argues, instead, that it is impossible to separate the two entities for the purposes of the legal analysis of this challenge, since Services OR LP/SEC \"was created by Norton Rose OR (now Norton Rose Fulbright LLP) to purvey certain labor services to its own employees, with the same legal address of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP and whose legal representative is Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\"7\n\nCLA-297.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b615.\n\n32.\n\nVenezuela states that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is the firm \"with the largest number of claims against the Republic at the international level.\"8 Furthermore, Respondent stresses that in this proceeding in particular \"there is a *direct, specific and current* participation of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP against the Republic in the local expropriation proceeding *with regard to the same measures* that are subject of the international arbitration.\"9 For Venezuela, this means that \"any decision that Mr. Fortier takes with respect to Claimants\u2019 claim relative to the expropriation proceeding in this international arbitration shall have a direct impact on the same issue in the national proceeding, and vice versa.\"10\n\nThird Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b616.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b619. See also, Third Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b616-18, in which Venezuela explains that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP represents the company UNIMIN de Venezuela S.C.S. \"in the local expropriation proceedings in which it is litigating against various measures challenged in this arbitration -in particular, a provisional measure and a legal notice ordered in Venezuela.\"\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b621. See also Third Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b621.\n\n33.\n\nIn this regard, Venezuela adds that \"the risk that an adverse decision in these proceedings to the interest of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP would pose to Mr. Fortier, and the impact that this could have on the conditions under which his assistants collaborate with him in his practice as arbitrator\u2014even regarding these same proceedings\u2014, would cause any impartial third party to have doubts about Mr. Fortier\u2019s impartiality in this case.\"11\n\nThird Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b621.\n\n34.\n\nFinally, in response to Claimants\u2019 argument that Venezuela\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification is abusive, Venezuela notes that: (i) the responsibility for the successive challenges is exclusively Mr. Fortier's, since he failed to reveal the information regarding his professional relationship with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP; (ii) Respondent proceeded cautiously and prudently in this case, first consulting the Secretariat; and (iii) the fact that other challenges by Venezuela in other proceedings have or have not been accepted is irrelevant to determine if there has been an abuse of process in this case.12\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b6\u00b625-30.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nClaimants request that the Third Proposal for Disqualification be rejected and that Respondent be ordered to pay the costs, legal fees and any other expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with it.13\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b6\u00b623-24.\n\n36.\n\nClaimants state that Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules set a high threshold for the disqualification of an arbitrator. Citing previous challenge decisions, the Claimants assert that such standard consist of the objective and stringent requirement that there be a \"manifest\" lack of the qualities set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, which means an \"evident\" or \"obvious\" lack of such qualities, excluding \"reliance on speculative assumptions or arguments.\"14\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b6\u00b66-7.\n\n37.\n\nClaimants quote the paragraphs of the Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification and of the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* Challenge Decision VI in which the legal standard for arbitration disqualification is described and argue that \"on any view of the facts, the application of these standards cannot possibility lead to the disqualification of Mr. Fortier.\"15\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b6\u00b68-10.\n\n38.\n\nClaimants contend that the benefits provided by Services OR LP/SEC are administrative in nature and do not give rise to any partnership or professional links between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.16 Claimants further note that Respondent\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification is virtually identical to its July 22, 2016 proposal to disqualify Mr. Fortier in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, as well as to previous disqualifications proposals filed by the Respondent against Mr. Fortier.17\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b612.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b614.\n\n39.\n\nIn that regard, Claimants sustain that the conclusion reached by President Zuleta and Professor Bucher in the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* Challenge Decision VI to reject Mr. Fortier\u2019s disqualification proposal is unassailable and should equally apply to this case.18 Claimants highlight in particular that, \"[a]s observed by President Zuleta and Professor Bucher, the administrative nature of the relationship between Arbitrator Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC (a legal entity distinct from Norton Rose OR LLP and/or Norton Rose Fulbright LLP) 'does not reveal any ties or influence between the two firms in respect of their legal work and responsibilities.'\"19\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b615.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b616.\n\n40.\n\nClaimants also argue that, even if Ms. Ntashamaje were \"an employee of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP (which does not appear to be the case), that still would not lead a reasonable third person with knowledge of that fact to the conclusion that Arbitrator Fortier manifestly lacks independence and impartiality,\" since Ms. Ntashamaje role as a secretary \"is purely administrative and plays no part in Arbitrator Fortier\u2019s decision-making; she simply has no influence on Arbitrator Fortier\u2019s independence or impartiality in this case.\"20\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b617.\n\n41.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding Norton Rose Fulbright LLP\u2019s involvement in the local expropriation proceedings in Venezuela, Claimants contend that the Two Members already considered and rejected such arguments.21 Referring to their reply to Respondent\u2019s Second Disqualification Proposal,22 Claimants merely note that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP\u2019s client is not a party to those local proceedings and was only included due to Respondent\u2019s procedural mistake.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b618.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification of Arbitrator Yves Fortier, of March 9, 2016, \u00b6\u00b622-24.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b619\n\n42.\n\nClaimants further argue that Respondent\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification \"is only the most recent instance of the Respondent\u2019s procedural misconduct and abuse of its rights,\" noting that, \"in the context of either ICSID or ICSID Additional Facility proceedings in the last six years alone, the Respondent has requested the disqualification of an arbitrator in no less than 24 occasions\" and only one resulted in the disqualification of an arbitrator.24\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b6\u00b621-22.\n\n**D. EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY MR. FORTIER**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of July 22, 2016 are transcribed below:\n\nDear Marisa,\n\nI have seen the Respondent\u2019s letter of 8 July 2016 with two annexes addressed to you. I have also seen your email of 14 July addressed to the parties, the Respondent\u2019s communication of 14 July and your reply of 15 July. I am happy to provide the following explanations.\n\nI recall that I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP on 31 December 2011 and that I then severed definitively my professional relationship with that firm. As of 1 January 2012, I commenced my practice as a sole and independent international arbitrator with Cabinet Yves Fortier. When I left Norton Rose OR LLP, I was sitting as an arbitrator (Chairman or party-appointed) on many arbitral tribunals. I then had two secretaries, Ms. Linda Tucci (\"Linda\") and Ms. Chantal Robichaud (\"Chantal\"), working exclusively for me. They had both been working with me for many years.\n\nIn order to ensure that I could continue my busy practice as an international arbitrator after 31 December 2011 with the least possible disruption, I asked Linda and Chantal if they would be prepared to continue to work with me at Cabinet Yves Fortier. They accepted as long as they could continue to participate in all insurance and other benefits to which they were entitled with Services OR LP/SEC (see below).\n\nServices OR LP/SEC is a distinct legal entity set up by Norton Rose OR LLP for the purpose of providing staff and administrative support services to Norton Rose OR LLP. When I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP, I entered into a service arrangement with Services OR LP/SEC with respect to the services of Linda and Chantal at the Cabinet Yves Fortier as of 1 January 2012.\n\nAccordingly, Linda and Chantal followed me physically to the Cabinet Yves Fortier where they worked exclusively for me as of 1 January 2012. They continued to be paid by Services OR LP/SEC who, every month, presented me with an invoice representing the amount of their salaries and the cost of their incidental benefits. I have settled these monthly invoices with Services OR LP/SEC since 1 January 2012.\n\nChantal left my Cabinet in July 2013. I then hired Myriam Ntashamaje (\"Myriam\") in August 2013 under the same arrangement as Chantal as I wanted her to have the same treatment as Linda. Since that time, Myriam has worked and continues to work exclusively for the Cabinet Yves Fortier. As I did in Chantal\u2019s case, I reimburse Services OR LP/SEC every month for her salary and the cost of all her incidental benefits.\n\nMyriam has never worked for Norton Rose Fulbright and is not an attorney. She is a secretary who assists me clerically in my arbitration files including the present one. The entry in her LinkedIn profile is inaccurate. Her own electronic signature on her email communications on my behalf or on behalf of my colleague, Ms Annie Lesp\u00e9rance, is very clear. It reads as follows:\n\n*Myriam Ntashamaje*\n\n*Legal assistant to The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, P.C., CC, OQ, QC and Ms. Annie Lesp\u00e9rance*\n\nTo be clear, Me Annie Lesp\u00e9rance, whom the parties met in April at the Paris hearing, is the only lawyer who works with me at the Cabinet Yves Fortier. She is remunerated directly by me.\n\nI hope these explanations answer to their satisfaction the questions which counsel for the Respondent put to the ICSID Secretary, Ms Marisa Planells-Valero, on 8 July 2016.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nYves Fortier QC Montreal, 22 July 2016\n\n44.\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of August 8, 2016 read as follows:\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn accordance with the schedule which you have fixed, I now provide you with brief additional explanations.\n\n1) As to the facts, they are set out in my email of 22 July 2016 to Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero which is part of the record with all documents therein referred to.\n\n2) Also in the record is the Decision of 26 July 2016 of my co-arbitrators in ICSID Case No. Arb/07/30 (\"the Decision\") where the proposal of Venezuela for my disqualification based on the same grounds as those invoked by the Respondent in the present proposal was dismissed.\n\n3) Also in the record is your Reasoned Decision of 28 March 2016 rejecting the earlier proposal made by the Respondent to disqualify me as arbitrator in this case. Many of the reasons in that Decision are very pertinent to the present proposal (see in particular paragraph 46).\n\n4) As the Respondent maintains again that I continue to have professional links with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP \"up to date\" (paragraph 6, see also paragraph 15), I will affirm again that I resigned as a partner of Norton Rose OR on 31 December 2011 and severed all of my professional links with that firm on that date.\n\n5) I reiterate that the service arrangement between Cabinet Yves Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC with respect to the services of my secretaries since 1 January 2012 does not in any way cause my reliability for independent judgment and impartiality in the present case to be put into question.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nYves Fortier QC\n\n**E. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Two Members refer to their analysis of the legal standard for the disqualification of an arbitrator in their Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification25 and adopt that analysis for their consideration of the Third Proposal for Disqualification herein.\n\nDecision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b625-34.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent has alleged two grounds for the disqualification of Mr. Fortier: (i) Mr. Fortier employs as an assistant Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje, who in her LinkedIn profile claims to have worked at the firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP since August 2013; and (ii) Ms. Ntashamaje, as well as Mr. Fortier\u2019s other secretary, receive their salary and other employment benefits from the company Services OR LP/SEC, an entity set up by Norton Rose OR LLP (now Norton Rose Fulbright LLP), for the purpose of providing staff and administrative support services to Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\n\n47.\n\nThe Two Members will address each ground in turn.\n\n**1. The First Ground**\n-----------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe factual predicate of the first ground asserted by the Respondent is that: (1) Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje has been an employee of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP since August 2013; (2) Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is acting in a large number of cases against the Respondent and parties related to the Respondent; (3) Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje has been assisting Mr. Fortier in the present arbitration and had access to the Box folder containing the electronic record of this arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nThe Two Members acknowledge at the outset that if these facts were to be true then a serious question would arise concerning the integrity of the information exchanged in these proceedings as it would have to be assumed that a law firm, which is not a counsel of record in this case, was able to access the record of the arbitration through the employment of Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje and her access to the Box folder.\n\n50.\n\nThe second and third factual premises set out above are not in dispute. In relation to the first premise, the Respondent has referred to a LinkedIn page that appears to be maintained by Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje herself which states under the rubric \"Experience\" that she has occupied the following position from August 2013 to the present: \"Legal support (International Arbitration), Norton Rose Fulbright\".\n\n51.\n\nGiven the contents of this webpage in the public domain, the Two Arbitrators consider that it was legitimate and proper for the Respondent to have sought Mr. Fortier\u2019s clarification as to the position of Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje on July 8, 2016. Mr. Fortier then provided the requested clarification on July 22, 2016, which, insofar as relevant to this First Ground, was as follows: \"Myriam has never worked for Norton Rose Fulbright and is not an attorney. She is a secretary who assists me clerically in my arbitration files including the present one. The entry in her LinkedIn profile is inaccurate.\"\n\n52.\n\nHaving received this clarification from Mr. Fortier, the Two Members do not consider that the Respondent was justified in taking its next steps. The Respondent proceeded to file a challenge to Mr. Fortier on the basis that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje was indeed an employee of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP from August 2013 onwards and/or that it made no difference whether or not this was a \"mistake\" because the relevant perspective for adjudging the impartiality of an arbitrator is that of a third party, who would conclude on the basis of the \"evidence\" that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje was not mistaken at all.26\n\nThird Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b611-12.\n\n53.\n\nThe Two Members have no reason to doubt the veracity of Mr. Fortier\u2019s clarification and the Respondent has not furnished any evidence to undermine it. As to the perspective of a third party, the question can be stated rather simply: would a third party in possession of Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje\u2019s LinkedIn page and Mr. Fortier\u2019s subsequent clarification in relation to the information displayed on that LinkedIn page conclude that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje had committed an error, or would that person conclude that Mr. Fortier has deliberately misrepresented the true state of affairs concerning Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje\u2019s employment to the Two Members, the Parties and ICSID in full knowledge that his clarification will be recorded in a decision that will be made public and that the contents of his representation are easily susceptible to verification by the public?\n\n54.\n\nOnce the hypothetical question to the reasonable third person is stripped of innuendo and posed in a direct and transparent fashion, there can be no doubt about what the third person\u2019s response would be: a reasonable third person would conclude that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje had committed an error on her LinkedIn page and that the true state of affairs is that she has been employed by Cabinet Yves Fortier throughout the relevant period.\n\n55.\n\nThe Two Members dismiss the First Ground of the Respondent\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n**2. The Second Ground**\n------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second ground relates to the existence of a relationship between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP that arises as a result of Mr. Fortier\u2019s service arrangement with Services OR LP/SEC following his resignation as a partner of Norton Rose OR LLP on December 31, 2011. Services OR LP/SEC is a distinct legal entity that was established by Norton Rose OR LLP (the predecessor firm to Norton Rose Fulbright LLP) for the purpose of providing staff and administrative support services to Norton Rose OR LLP. (The Two Members assume for the purposes of this application that Services OR LP/SEC continue to provide services to Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.) When Mr. Fortier resigned from Norton Rose OR LLP, his two secretaries at the law firm departed with him to Cabinet Yves Fortier. In order to ensure continuity in respect of their existing insurance entitlements and other benefits, however, they continued to be paid by Services OR LP/SEC. Services OR LP/SEC in turn presented Mr. Fortier with monthly invoices for their salaries and the cost of their incidental benefits which Mr. Fortier has settled since January 1, 2012. Upon the resignation of one of the two secretaries in July 2013, Mr. Fortier then retained Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje in August 2013 on the basis of the same arrangement with Services OR LP/SEC so that both secretaries would be treated equally.\n\n57.\n\nIn assessing the significance of the relationship between Norton Rose Fulbright LLP and Mr. Fortier for the purposes of adjudging the Respondent\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification, the Two Members recall their observations in their Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal for Disqualification in respect of an understanding between Norton Rose OR LLP and Mr. Fortier that lawyers of Norton Rose OR LLP serving as assistants to tribunals over which Mr. Fortier was presiding could continue to serve in that capacity after the departure of Mr. Fortier from the law firm:\n\nIt does not assist the Respondent\u2019s case to characterize the aforementioned understanding as a \"relationship\". What is important is whether that understanding, whether or not it is characterized as a relationship, could be interpreted by a reasonable third person as capable of influencing Mr. Fortier\u2019s judgment in the present case. A \"relationship\" can encompass a spectrum of possible connections between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, some of which would cause no reasonable third person to doubt for an instant that Mr. Fortier were capable of exercising independent and impartial judgment, and others which would inexorably result in Mr. Fortier\u2019s disqualification. At one end of the spectrum, if Mr. Fortier retained personal friendships with some of the lawyers at the firm at which he practiced for over 50 years, which would hardly be surprising, this could not result in his disqualification. Likewise, if Mr. Fortier is a tenant of the same office building as Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, together with other law firms and companies as would appear to be the case, then this might also be described as a relationship but not a material one for the purposes of adjudging Mr. Fortier\u2019s ability to act independently and impartially. In contradistinction, if Mr. Fortier were to continue to receive a share of the profits generated by Norton Rose OR (now Norton Rose Fulbright LLP) following his resignation, would cause a reasonable third person to entertain doubts about Mr. Fortier\u2019s impartiality. That is because Mr. Fortier in that situation would have a direct financial interest in the activities of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, which include acting against the Respondent in international and domestic proceedings. But no financial interest on the part of Mr. Fortier has even been alleged and Mr. Fortier\u2019s affirmation that he severed all professional ties with Norton Rose OR on December 31, 2011 rules out any such financial interest.27\n\nDecision on the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b646.\n\n58.\n\nIn its Third Proposal for Disqualification, the Respondent refers to this reasoning in the Two Members\u2019 Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification and submits that:\n\n[T]he new information disclosed on 22 July 2016 leaves no room for doubt as to the fact that the relationship between Mr. Fortier and Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is located near the financial end of the spectrum of possible connections, which -according to co-arbitrators Shin and Douglas- would cause a reasonable third party to have doubts about Mr. Fortier\u2019s impartiality in these proceedings. This is so because Mr. Fortier has a contractual and economic relationship with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, which he failed to disclose to the parties, and from which he obtains an economic benefit presumably in exchange for some sort of consideration.28\n\nThird Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b624.\n\n59.\n\nThe Two Members do not agree with the Respondent\u2019s analysis. There is no element of the relationship between Mr. Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC that would cause a reasonable third party to conclude that Mr. Fortier is manifestly lacking in the ability to act impartially in this arbitration. It cannot possibly be said that the services arrangement between Mr. Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC gives Mr. Fortier a direct financial interest in the activities of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP (activities which include acting against the Respondent in international and domestic proceedings). Services OR LP/SEC invoices Mr. Fortier for the salaries and incidental benefits paid by Services OR LP/SEC to his secretaries and Mr. Fortier has paid those invoices on a monthly basis since January 1, 2012. The relationship between Mr. Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC is thus financially neutral.\n\n60.\n\nThe Two Members accept that Mr. Fortier benefits from the convenience of maintaining this arrangement with Services OR LP/SEC and that presumably it is within the power of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP to terminate that arrangement even if Services OR LP/SEC is a separate legal entity. The Two Members also accept for the purposes of this application that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP has an indirect financial interest in the success of the claimants it represents against the Respondent and its affiliated entities. But once again the Two Members ask whether a reasonable third person could conclude that the convenience of maintaining this arrangement between Mr. Fortier and Services OR LP/SEC means that Mr. Fortier\u2019s interests are sufficiently aligned with the interests of Norton Rose Fulbright LLP such that Mr. Fortier cannot be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment in this case? The Two Members conclude that a reasonable third person would not entertain serious doubts about Mr. Fortier\u2019s capacity to exercise independent and impartial judgment with knowledge of these facts.\n\n61.\n\nFinally, the Respondent, as in the Second Proposal for Disqualification, asserts that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP is acting for a company called UNIMIN in domestic litigation in Venezuela \"which questions the supposed lack of determination of the expropriated assets and the lack of due process in the expropriation proceeding debated in this arbitration\".29 The Claimants deny this: they maintain that Norton Rose Fulbright LLP\u2019s client is not a party to those local proceedings and was only included due to Respondent\u2019s procedural mistake.30 The Two Members cannot resolve this contested issue in the present context as it would necessitate making findings of fact in relation to the nature and scope of the domestic proceedings. The Two Members instead have assumed that the Respondent\u2019s assertion is accurate for the purposes of determining this Third Proposal for Disqualification and have found that this additional circumstance cannot possibly have an impact on the ability of Mr. Fortier to exercise impartial and independent judgment for the reasons contained in this section of our Decision.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments, \u00b620.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply of August 5, 2016, \u00b619, \u00b621-22.\n\n**F. COSTS**\n------------\n\n62.\n\nAs the Two Members have already noted, it was legitimate and proper for the Respondent to seek Mr. Fortier\u2019s clarification in respect of the employment status of Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje in the circumstances. The same cannot be said for the Respondent\u2019s decision, once having received Mr. Fortier\u2019s clarification, to proceed to file its Third Proposal for Disqualification. For these reasons the Two Members have decided that the Respondent shall be responsible for the costs associated with this Third Proposal for Disqualification and that an order to that effect will be made in the final award to be issued by the Tribunal in these proceedings.\n\n**G. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n63.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Two Members:\n\n(1) Decide to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification, and\n\n(2) Decide that the Respondent shall be responsible for the costs associated with the Third Proposal for Disqualification and that an order to that effect will be made in the award to be issued by the Tribunal in these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Venezuela to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\"). On August 10, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on February 14, 2013, and comprised Professor Hi-Taek Shin, a national of Korea, appointed as president pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), Mr. L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada, appointed by the Claimants, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session in Paris, France. During the session a number of procedural matters were decided, including a schedule for pleadings. In accordance with the schedule: (i) the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits on July 15, 2013; (ii) the Respondent filed a request to address objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter on August 16, 20132; (iii) the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits on December 20, 2013; (iv) the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on March 21, 2014; (v) the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and a Reply on Jurisdiction on June 20, 2014; and (vi) the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on August 21, 2014. A hearing on jurisdiction and merits was scheduled to be held in Paris, from March 30 through April 3, 2015.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 2 of September 23, 2013, the Tribunal declined the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 13, 2015, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (\"**First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Centre transmitted the First Proposal for Disqualification to the Claimants and to the Tribunal and informed the Parties that the proceeding was suspended until the First Proposal for Disqualification was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural schedule for written submissions on the First Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n9.\n\nIn addition, on that same date, following receipt of a copy of the Proposal, Mr. Mourre submitted his resignation to the other members of the Tribunal and the Secretary-General of ICSID. The Centre immediately communicated Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation to the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 19, 2015, Prof. Shin informed the Parties that, in view of the pending challenge, the dates for the upcoming hearing were vacated, and that new hearing dates would be fixed as soon as possible after the resumption of the proceeding.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (i) rejected as untimely the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Yves Fortier, and (ii) dismissed, in view of Mr. Mourre\u2019s resignation, the Respondent\u2019s First Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Alexis Mourre (\"**Decision on the First Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), the Tribunal consented to the resignation of Mr. Alexis Mourre.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, the Respondent appointed Prof. Zachary Douglas QC, a national of Australia, as arbitrator, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1).\n\n14.\n\nOn 5 August 2015, the Centre (i) notified the Parties of Prof. Douglas\u2019 acceptance of his appointment as an arbitrator, and (ii) informed the Parties that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 12, the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceeding resumed as of that date from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy occurred.\n\n15.\n\nOn September 15, 2015, following an exchange of communications with the Parties, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing on jurisdiction and merits would be held in Paris, France, from April 4 through April 8, 2016.\n\n16.\n\nOn March 4, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (the \"**Second Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn March 7, 2016, the Centre transmitted the Second Proposal for Disqualification to the Claimants and to the Tribunal and confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Second Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n18.\n\nOn that same date, the President of the Tribunal, having consulted with Professor Douglas (the \"**Two Members**\"), set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n19.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, the Two Members informed the Parties that the Second Proposal for Disqualification was rejected. The Two Members indicated that, in view of the proximity of the hearing scheduled from April 4 to 8, 2016, they had decided to communicate their decision to the Parties with the full reasoning for that decision to follow as soon as possible. On March 28, 2016, the reasoned decision of the Two Members was transmitted to the Parties (\"**Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n20.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum took place in Paris, France, from April 4 to April 8, 2016.\n\n21.\n\nOn June 4, 2016, the Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs.\n\n22.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, the Parties filed their submissions on costs.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of July 8, 2016, the Respondent noted (i) that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje, Mr. Fortier\u2019s assistant, had access to the Box folder of the present case, and (ii) that, according to her LinkedIn account, Ms. Ntashamaje \"has been working since August 2013 until the present day as an attorney in the international arbitration practice of the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\" The Respondent requested to be informed of the reasons why Ms. Ntashamaje had access to the case\u2019s documents and on what basis she had such access.\n\n24.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, Mr. Fortier asked the Centre to transmit to the Parties and to the Two Members a letter providing explanations to the questions posed by the Respondent in its July 8, 2016 letter (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of July 22, 2016**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (the \"**Third Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn July 26, 2016, the Centre transmitted the Third Proposal for Disqualification to the Claimants and to the Tribunal and confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Third Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n27.\n\nOn August 2, 2016, the Two Members set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n28.\n\nOn September 12, 2016, the Two Members rejected the Respondent\u2019s Third Proposal for Disqualification (\"**Decision on the Third Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n29.\n\nOn September 28, 2016, each Party filed a statement on the costs incurred in connection with the Third Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n30.\n\nOn November 2, 2016, each Party filed observations on the other Party\u2019s statement of costs incurred in connection with the Third Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n31.\n\nOn December 23, 2016, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Fortier (the \"**Fourth Proposal for Disqualification**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn that same date, the Centre transmitted the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification to the Claimants and to the Tribunal and confirmed that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding was suspended until a decision was taken with respect to the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n33.\n\nOn December 30, 2016, the Two Members set a timetable for the Parties\u2019 submissions and Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations on the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n34.\n\nOn January 5, 2017, Mr. Fortier requested an extension until January 20, 2017 for the submission of his explanations. On January 9, 2017, the Two Members granted the requested extension.\n\n35.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, the Claimant requested an extension until January 16, 2017 for the submission of their Reply to the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification. On January 11, 2017, the Two Members granted the requested extension.\n\n36.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable set by the Two Members on December 30, 2016, as modified on January 9 and 11, 2017, the Claimants filed their Reply to the Fourth Disqualification Proposal on January 16, 2017 (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Reply of January 16, 2017**\"), and Mr. Fortier furnished his explanations on January 20, 2017 (\"**Mr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of January 20, 2017**\").\n\n37.\n\nOn January 26, 2017 the Respondent requested an extension for the filing of the Parties\u2019 Additional Observations on the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification until February 10, 2017. On that same date, the Claimants opposed this request.\n\n38.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, the Claimants submitted to the Secretariat their Additional Observations on the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations**\"). By this communication, the Claimants shared their understanding that, pursuant to the Two Members\u2019 communication of January 20, 2017, the Centre would forward the Claimants\u2019 Additional Observations to the Respondent, to the Two Members and to Mr. Fortier, following receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Additional Observations.\n\n39.\n\nOn that same date, the Two Members granted the Respondent\u2019s request for an extension.\n\n40.\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the Respondent requested that the Two Members schedule (i) a document production phase and (ii) a hearing to examine certain witnesses in connection with the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification (the \"**Document Production and Hearing Request**\"). By communications of February 3, 4 and 6, the Claimants opposed the Document Production and Hearing Request. On February 6, 2017, the Respondent submitted a further communication on this matter.\n\n41.\n\nOn February 7, 2017, the Two Members informed the Parties that they would be taking a decision on the Document Production and Hearing Request following their review of the Parties\u2019 Additional Comments on the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n42.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, the Respondent submitted its Additional Observations on the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments**\"). On February 13, 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated to the other Party, to the Two Members and to Mr. Fortier, each Party\u2019s Additional Comments.\n\n**C. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective positions in connection with the present Proposal for Disqualification are briefly outlined below. The Two Members note, however, that in deciding this matter they have considered the full extent of the Parties\u2019 arguments in their written submissions. To the extent that arguments are not referred to expressly in the brief summary below, they should be deemed to be subsumed into the Two Members\u2019 analysis.\n\n**1. Venezuela\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nVenezuela states that it has gathered certain evidence that would prove that Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje, Mr. Fortier\u2019s assistant, has been employed by Norton Rose Fulbright LLP (\"**NRF** \") since August 2013, and requests, on this basis, the disqualification of Mr. Fortier as an arbitrator in this case.3\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 17-18. Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 7.\n\n45.\n\nVenezuela explains that, following the issuance of the Decision on the Third Proposal for Disqualification, it decided to hire the services of the firm Quest Research & Investigations LLC (\"**QRI**\") to conduct an investigation regarding the employment status of Ms. Ntashamaje.4\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 24.\n\n46.\n\nVenezuela states that, through the services of this firm, it has been able to obtain confirmation of the following:\n\nI. Confirmation that Ms. Ntashamaje \"is currently and has been at all times since 26 August 2013 a permanent employee at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\" Venezuela explains that this confirmation was provided by Ms. Claudia Gagnon, Compensation and Mobility Technician at NRF, by email of December 7, 2016 in response to QRI\u2019s employment verification request regarding Ms. Ntashamaje.5\n\nII. Confirmation that Ms. Ntashamaje \"possesses a telephone extension within Norton Rose Fulbright LLP\u2019s automatic answering system, through which she can be directly reached at the office\"6 and an email address with NRF.7\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6\u00b6 26-31. Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 4. See also, Affidavit of Tyler Maroney of December 23, 2016 (\"Affidavit of T. Maroney\").\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 33. Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 6. *See* Affidavit of T. Maroney p. 1, where Mr. Maroney explains that this confirmation was obtained by calling the main number of the NRF Montreal\u2019s office and \"[entering] the first three letters of Ntashamaje\u2019s last name using the phone\u2019s alphanumeric keypad. The NRF answering system identified, in English, the owner of the extension as Myriam Ntashamaje and transferred the call to that extension. After approximately five rings, the call was answered by a voicemail in which a female voice identified herself in French as Ntashamaje.\"\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 34. Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 5. *See* Affidavit of T. Maroney p. 1, where Mr. Maroney explains that one of QRI employees sent an email to myriam.ntashamaje@nortonrosefulbright.com, and did not receive a bounce back.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, these evidence would prove that when Mr. Fortier declared, in his explanations of July 22, 2016, that Ms. Ntashamaje has never worked for NRF, he \"deliberately or with inexcusable negligence, [...] misrepresent[ed] the true state of affairs regarding Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright LLP.\"8\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 13.\n\n48.\n\nVenezuela further submits that these evidence would also demonstrate that Mr. Fortier \"breached the confidentiality of this arbitration by granting unauthorized and undisclosed access to the record of the case to an employee of a law firm that is counsel of record to neither party in this arbitration.\"9\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 35.\n\n49.\n\nVenezuela concludes that this \"misconduct makes arbitrator Yves Fortier unsuited to serve any longer as an arbitrator in these proceedings for lack of the traits required by an arbitrator under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"10\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 18. Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 32.\n\n50.\n\nVenezuela also submits, together with its Additional Observations, the affidavit of Mr. Danny Kastner, an expert in Canadian employment law.11 Based on this affidavit, Venezuela argues that the scheme under which Ms. Ntashamaje would be receiving NRF health benefits through the coverage offered by Services OR LP/SEC, without being a NRF employee, could only mean that \"Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, Cabinet Fortier and Mr. Fortier himself have engaged in fraudulent conduct under Canadian law.\"12\n\nAffidavit of Mr. Danny Kastner, J.D., of February 8, 2017 (\"Affidavit of Mr. Kastner\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 21. See also Affidavit of Mr. Kastner pp. 2-3.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, this would also make Mr. Fortier \"ostensibly unfit to act as an arbitrator in this international arbitration, in as far as his conduct is contrary to the moral standard required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"13\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 22.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, Venezuela argues that the cost of this proposal should be discharged from the fees received by Mr. Fortier as an arbitrator in this proceeding, and request that the Two Members \"reconsider their prior decisions condemning [Venezuela] in costs regarding the proposals to disqualify Yves Fortier.\"14\n\nFourth Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 45. Respondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 39.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification be rejected and that Respondent be ordered to pay the costs, legal fees and any other expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with it.15\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6\u00b6 63-65.\n\n54.\n\nFirstly, the Claimants argue that the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification fails as a matter of fact because (i) Ms. Ntashamaje has never been employed by NRF, and (ii) there is no evidence \"even suggesting that Ms Ntashamaje has shared confidential information with Norton Rose or otherwise undermined the integrity of these proceedings.\"16\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 4. Claimants\u2019 Additional Comments p. 1.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants submit, together with their Reply, a letter from Mr. Jean-Charles Ren\u00e9, NRF\u2019s General Counsel and Head of Risk in Canada.17 According to the Claimants, the information provided in this letter confirms that:\n\n(i) Ms. Ntashamaje receives her salary and other employment benefits from the company Services OR LP, a distinct legal entity from NRF.18\n\n(ii) The information on Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment status that Ms. Gagnon provided to the Respondent\u2019s investigator is inaccurate as, for the purpose of confirming the hiring date, title and status of Ms. Ntashamaje, Ms. Gagnon consulted a list of employees that \"comprises all of Services OR LP\u2019s employees and does not distinguish between those who work at [NRF] and those who do not.\"19\n\n(iii) Ms. Ntashamaje does not have a telephone extension at NRF and when calling Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s number, \"[her] voicemail message expressly states that she works for Arbitrator Fortier and does not mention Norton Rose.\"20\n\n(iv) Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s email address at NRF \"[has been] made available to Ms. Ntashamaje in order for her to receive general administrative information relating to such subjects as social benefits, remuneration, etc.\"21\n\nSee Mr. Jean-Charles Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter of January 13, 2017 (C-257) (\"Mr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter\"). Mr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter was submitted in response to the Claimants\u2019 letter to NRF of January 7, 2017 (C-256).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 12. *See also* Mr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter p. 1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 13.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 15. *See also* Mr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter p.3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 16.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that no evidence to support the allegation that Mr. Fortier breached the confidentiality of this proceeding by granting access to the documents in this case to Ms. Ntashamaje has been put forward by the Respondent. According to the Claimants, Mr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter confirms this when he certifies that \"no individual working at [NRF] has access to the documents and records of Cabinet Yves Fortier.\"22\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.\n\n57.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants argue that the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification also fails as a matter of law because \"even if Ms. Ntashamaje was employed by Norton Rose (*quod non*), the Respondent has failed to demonstrate how that fact could affect the independence or impartiality of Arbitrator Fortier.\"23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 6.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants state that Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules set a high threshold for the disqualification of an arbitrator. Citing previous challenge decisions, the Claimants assert that such standard consist of the objective and stringent requirement that there be a \"manifest\" lack of the qualities set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, which means an \"evident\" or \"obvious\" lack of such qualities, excluding \"reliance on speculative assumptions or arguments.\"24\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6\u00b6 22-27.\n\n59.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, even assuming that Ms. Ntashamaje was employed by NRF, the Respondent has failed \"to explain the basis on which a reasonable third person could conclude that the assistance of a Norton Rose secretary at Cabinet Yves Fortier [\u2026] means that Arbitrator Fortier\u2019s interests are sufficiently aligned with the interests of Norton Rose such that he cannot be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment in this case.\"25 Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s role at Cabinet Fortier is purely administrative and there is no objective basis for believing that she plays any part in Mr. Fortier\u2019s decision-making.26 As a result, the subject-matter of Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations regarding Ms. Ntashamaje would be immaterial for purposes of ascertaining Mr. Fortier\u2019s ability to exercise independent or impartial judgment.27\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Claimants\u2019 Additional Comments p. 1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 33, footnote 32 citing, *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify L. Yves Fortier, Q.C. Arbitrator (July 26, 2016) \u00b6 12(d) (CLA-297).\n\n60.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants continue, \"even assuming there was a breach of confidentiality [...], this alone [would] not be one of the grounds established in the ICSID Convention for the disqualification of an arbitrator.\" According to the Claimants, \"[m]erely allowing someone to have access to the Box folder created for this case, even if it turns out they should not have had such access, could not, without more, lead a reasonable third person to conclude that the arbitrator manifestly lacks impartiality or independence.\"28\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 34.\n\n61.\n\nFinally, the Claimants object to the Respondent\u2019s request for the reconsideration of the Two Members previous decisions on costs stating that \"[m]erely filing a new disqualification proposal does not allow a party to request 'reconsideration' of prior, fully adjudicated costs decisions\" and that, as the Respondent\u2019s Second and Third Proposals for Disqualification were abusive and manifestly unfounded, the prior decisions on costs \"should stand regardless of the outcome of the present Proposal.\"29\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 65.\n\n**D. EXPLANATIONS FURNISHED BY MR. FORTIER**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nMr. Fortier\u2019s Explanations of January 19, 2017, submitted together with an affidavit signed by Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje, are attached as Annex A to this Decision.\n\n**E. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Two Members refer to their analysis of the legal standard for the disqualification of an arbitrator in their Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification30 and adopt that analysis for their consideration of the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification herein.\n\nDecision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 25-34. *See also* Decision on the Third Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 45\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent has deployed considerable resources since it last challenged Mr. Fortier on the basis that Ms. Ntashamaje has been employed by NRF since August 2013 to substantiate its allegation with evidence. Thus, for instance, it retained a private investigator to make inquiries about the employment history of Ms. Ntashamaje. Despite the Respondent\u2019s deployment of resources, however, there has been no material change to the situation that the Two Members described in their Decision on the Third Proposal for Disqualification. In that Decision, the Two Members concluded that they had no reason to doubt Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanation that Ms. Ntashamaje has never been employed by NRF. As matters stand today, the Two Members still have no reason to doubt that explanation.\n\n65.\n\nTo the contrary, all that the Respondent\u2019s deployment of resources has achieved is to compel Ms. Ntashamaje, and a Senior Partner and General Counsel and Head of Risk at NRF Canada, Jean-Charles Ren\u00e9, to confirm what Mr. Fortier had already confirmed during the course of the Third Proposal for Disqualification. Ms. Ntashamaje confirmed, in a sworn affidavit, that she has never been employed by NRF. She also confirmed that her original LinkedIn profile was inaccurate. Mr. Ren\u00e9, in a letter that he recognised would be transmitted to the Tribunal and to the Respondent, confirmed that Ms. Ntashamaje has never been employed by NRF. He also confirmed Mr. Fortier\u2019s previous explanation that, for administrative reasons, she received her salary and employment benefits from Services OR LP, a separate legal entity established by Norton Rose OR LLP (now NRF) to provide administrative and support services to NRF. Mr. Ren\u00e9 stated that the \"reason why the assistants who followed [Mr. Fortier] to work exclusively at Cabinet Yves Fortier were paid by Services OR LP was to allow them to continue to participate in the insurance and other benefits to which they were entitled while working at Norton Rose OR LLP. When Ms. Ntashamaje was hired in August 2013 as a replacement for one of those assistants, the same arrangement was replicated, in order that all assistants working at Cabinet Yves Fortier would receive the same treatment\".31 Finally, Mr. Ren\u00e9 stated that: \"I can certify that no individual working at NRFC has access to the documents and records of Cabinet Yves Fortier.\"32\n\nMr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter pp. 1-2.\n\nMr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter p. 2.\n\n66.\n\nThese statements from Ms. Ntashamaje and Mr. Ren\u00e9, together with a further statement from Mr. Fortier, were given in response to the email exchange between the Respondent\u2019s private investigator and Ms. Gagnon, who is the Compensation and Mobility Technician at NRF, which was appended to the Respondent\u2019s Fourth Proposal for Disqualification. In that exchange, Ms. Gagnon stated that Ms. Ntashamaje was an employee of NRF rather than Cabinet Yves Fortier. Mr. Ren\u00e9 gave extensive explanations for why Ms. Gagnon\u2019s response was incorrect and the circumstances in which it was given. In particular, according to Mr. Ren\u00e9, Ms. Gagnon\u2019s list of Service OR LP\u2019s employees did not distinguish between those who work at NRF and those who do not.33\n\nMr. Ren\u00e9\u2019s letter p. 3.\n\n67.\n\nThe Two Members have no doubt that a reasonable third person would conclude that the explanations given by Ms. Ntashamaje, Mr. Ren\u00e9 and Mr. Fortier in relation to Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment history are more reliable than the information that had been extracted from Ms. Gagnon by a private investigator\u2014information that has since been repudiated by the responsible senior partner at NRF.\n\n68.\n\nOnce again the Two Members consider that it is important to recall the alleged significance of Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment history to Mr. Fortier\u2019s ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment in this case. It is not in dispute that Ms. Ntashamaje had access to the Box folder for this arbitration. The Respondent\u2019s argument is that, if Ms. Ntashamaje were in fact an employee of NRF, then that law firm, which frequently represents claimants in litigation against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, would be able to exploit that information in some way detrimental to the Respondent.\n\n69.\n\nIn their Decision on the Third Proposal for Disqualification, the Two Members acknowledged that if it were true that Ms. Ntashamaje were employed by NRF, then \"a serious question would arise concerning the integrity of the information exchanged in these proceedings as it would have to be assumed that a law firm, which is not a counsel of record in this case, was able to access the record of the arbitration through the employment of Ms. Myriam Ntashamaje and her access to the Box folder.\"34 But a serious question relating to the integrity of information exchanged in these proceedings does not necessarily translate into a serious ground for questioning the impartiality or independence of Mr. Fortier. The fervour in which the Respondent has pursued the gathering of evidence in relation to Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment history is thus surprising given the disconnect between the alleged mischief\u2014Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s purported employment at NRF\u2014and the impartiality or independence of Mr. Fortier.\n\nDecision on the Third Proposal for Disqualification \u00b6 49.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent wants to go even further. It has requested that the Two Members order the production of documents relating to the employment history of Ms. Ntashamaje and convene a hearing to examine the various protagonists that have become implicated in the Respondent\u2019s challenge of Mr. Fortier. The Two Members deny this request. First, it is by no means clear that the Two Members have the power to conduct a separate evidential trial in respect of written explanations provided in the context of a challenge to an arbitrator. By way of example, the Two Members have not been conferred any powers under the ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rules to preside over the interrogation of individuals who are not witnesses of either party in the arbitration (this would be the case at least in respect of Ms. Ntashamaje and Mr. Ren\u00e9 in the context of this Fourth Proposal for Disqualification). As the parties have not made submissions on this issue, the Two Members say nothing more about it.\n\n71.\n\nSecond, assuming that the Two Members do have such a power, the circumstances of this challenge militate strongly against its use. Even if Ms. Ntashamaje were found to be an employee of NRF, over the express written statements of Ms. Ntashamaje, NRF\u2019s General Counsel (Mr. Ren\u00e9) and Mr. Fortier to the contrary, then this would by no means be conclusive as to Mr. Fortier\u2019s lack of impartiality or independence. There is no evidence whatsoever to the effect that (1) Mr. Fortier granted access to the Box folder in this case to Ms. Ntashamaje so that she could share that information with employees of NRF or (2) Ms. Ntashamaje did in fact share that information with employees of NRF. If neither of those elements is established, the Two Members do not understand how Mr. Fortier\u2019s impartiality or independence could be impeached simply on the basis that Ms. Ntashamaje had access to the Box folder. The Respondent has never attempted to join the dots in this respect.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent has said that if it could be established that Ms. Ntashamaje were in fact an employee of NRF, then this would simultaneously establish that Mr. Fortier has given a false statement in the context of challenge proceedings and that in turn would cast serious doubts over Mr. Fortier\u2019s independence and impartiality. This possibility, in the Respondent\u2019s submission, justifies the convening of an evidential hearing on these matters. But this would be tantamount to saying that no statement by a challenged arbitrator to an allegation made by the challenging party can be accepted unless tested under cross-examination or otherwise corroborated by other witness testimony tested under cross-examination.\n\n73.\n\nIn a challenge process, the individuals or institution adjudicating the challenge have to assume that any statement made by the challenged arbitrator is made in good faith and is accurate unless and until compelling evidence is submitted by the challenging party to undermine that assumption. Any other approach would bring international arbitration as a system for dispute resolution to its knees: a challenge to an arbitrator would signal the beginning of a trial within a trial and crush any expectation of an efficient and affordable procedure.\n\n74.\n\nThe Two Members must deal with one final point raised by the Respondent. In reliance upon the affidavit of Mr. Kastner, an expert in Canadian employment law, the Respondent argues that the scheme under which Ms. Ntashamaje would be receiving NRF health benefits through the coverage offered by Services OR LP/SEC, without being a NRF employee, could only mean that \"Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, Cabinet Fortier and Mr. Fortier himself have engaged in fraudulent conduct under Canadian law,\"35 and that, on that basis, Mr. Fortier is \"ostensibly unfit to act as an arbitrator in this international arbitration, in as far as his conduct is contrary to the moral standard required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"36 As Mr. Kastner expressly put it in his Affidavit, he did not review the relevant insurance agreements in preparing the affidavit, and as such his analysis \"is obviously limited\"37. No other evidence was presented by the Respondent to substantiate its allegations of fraudulent conduct under Canadian law. The Two Members are not prepared to conclude on the basis of Mr. Kastner\u2019s \"limited\" analysis, conducted entirely in the abstract and without sight of the underlying documents, that an international law firm, NRF, has entered into a fraudulent scheme for the conferral of employment benefits and that Mr. Fortier is a party to that scheme.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6 22. *See also* Affidavit of Mr. Kastner pp. 2-3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Comments \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\nAffidavit of Mr. Kastner p. 2.\n\n75.\n\nThe Two Members dismiss the Respondent\u2019s Fourth Proposal for Disqualification. Its main factual predicate\u2014that Ms. Ntashamaje was employed by NRF\u2014has not been established. The Respondent concedes as much by requesting the production of documents relating to Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment and the convening of a hearing to interrogate those persons who have given statements confirming Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations.\n\n**F. COSTS**\n------------\n\n76.\n\nIn view of the lack of the merits of the Respondent\u2019s grounds for another challenge of Mr. Fortier as discussed above, the Two Members have decided that the Respondent shall be responsible for the costs associated with this Fourth Proposal for Disqualification and that an order to that effect will be made in the final award to be issued by the Tribunal in these proceedings.\n\n**G. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n77.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Two Members:\n\n(1) Decline the Respondent\u2019s request for the production of documents relating to Ms. Ntashamaje\u2019s employment and a hearing for the interrogation of persons who have given statements to confirm Mr. Fortier\u2019s explanations;\n\n(2) Dismiss the Respondent\u2019s Fourth Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Fortier;\n\n(3) Decide that the Respondent shall be responsible for the costs associated with the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification and that an order to that effect will be made in the award to be issued by the Tribunal in these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-11-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF SELECTED ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| Agreement or BIT | The Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed on 22 October 1991 and entering into force on 1 November 1993, to remain in force for fifteen years. |\n| C- [#] | Claimants\u2019 Exhibit |\n| Cabrera ER | Report by Jes\u00fas Eduardo Cabrera Romero, legal expert appointed by the Respondent, dated December 19, 2013. |\n| CADIVI | Commission for the Administration of Currency Exchange of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| CLA- [#] | Claimants\u2019 Legal Authority |\n| Claimants\u2019 Memorial | Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, dated July 15, 2016 |\n| Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief | Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, dated June 6, 2016 |\n| Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder | Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, dated August 21, 2014 |\n| Claimants\u2019 Reply | Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits and CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction, dated March 21, 2014 |\n| Claimants\u2019 Response | Claimants\u2019 Response to the Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, dated August 20, 2013 |\n| Expropriation Decree | Presidential Decree No. 7,751 issued by the President of the Republic on October 26, 2010 and published in Official Gazette No. 39,538 of October 26, 2010. |\n| Favianca | F\u00e1brica de Vidrios los Andes C.A. |\n| Gomez I WS | First witness statement of Luis Gomez dated July 14, 2013 |\n| Gomez II WS | Second witness statement of Luis Gomez dated March 20, 2014 |\n| Hernandez I ER | First Expert Report of Ignacio Hernandez dated July 10, 2013 |\n| Hernandez II ER | Second Expert Report of Ignacio Hernandez dated March 21, 2014 |\n| ICSID Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| INDEPABIS | Institute for Defence of People in the Access to Goods and Services of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| INPSASEL | National Institute for Prevention, Health and Work Safety of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| JATs | Temporary Administrative Boards created by the INDEPABIS to manage the Plants |\n| Kaczmarek\u2019s reports | Expert report by Brent C.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela dated October 22, 1991, which entered into force on November 1, 1993 (the \"Agreement\" or the \"BIT\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. (\"Favianca\") and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. (\"OIdV\"). Favianca and OIdV are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Claimants.\"\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants are companies incorporated under the laws of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela but controlled directly or indirectly by OI European Group B.V. (\"OIEG\"), a legal person constituted under the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. OIEG owns, through its combined direct and indirect shareholdings, 71,996% of the shares in Favianca. OIEG also directly owns 73.97% of the shares in OIdV.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is hereinafter referred to as \"Venezuela\", the \"Republic\" or the \"Respondent.\"\n\n5.\n\nThe organs of the Respondent principally involved in the circumstances of this arbitration are the President of Venezuela (at the time, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas), the National Guard, the Ministry of Popular Power for Science, Technology, and Intermediate Goods Industries (\"MINCIT\"), the National Institute for Labour Prevention, Health and Safety (\"INPSASEL\"), the Institute for the Defence of People in the Access to Goods and Services (\"INDEPABIS\") and the judiciary of Venezuela.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 current respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. OVERVIEW OF THE CASE AND THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverview of the Case\n--------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe dispute arises from the expropriation of the two largest glass container production plants in Venezuela. The Claimants allege that this expropriation was carried out illegally and with no compensation, and that the Respondent\u2019s behaviour with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investments breached numerous obligations under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT. The Claimants request substantial compensation. The Respondent challenges the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and also contends that there was no breach of the BIT.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 majority shareholder, OIEG, launched a parallel arbitration, namely *OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25), under the same BIT (\"the Parallel Arbitration\"). The tribunal in the parallel arbitration rendered its award on March 10, 2015 (\"the OIEG award\") unanimously awarding damages to OIEG. Venezuela has launched annulment proceedings which are currently pending.\n\n9.\n\nThe Parallel Arbitration addresses mostly the same substantive matters at issue in the present proceedings.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 Requests for Relief\n--------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn their Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, and as confirmed in their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to render an award:\n\n(i) declaring that the Respondent has breached the BIT, including Articles 3(1), 3(2), 3(4) and 6;\n\n(ii) ordering the Respondent to pay damages to the Claimants in the amount of not less than US$ 1,033,052,912.00;\n\n(iii) ordering the Respondent to pay compound interest on such amount that the Tribunal awards to the Claimants as damages (less any amount awarded by the Tribunal by way of moral damages) at the interest rate of LIBOR + 4 percent, such compound interest to run from the date of expropriation until the date upon which payment is made;\n\n(iv) ordering the Respondent to pay all of the Claimants\u2019 costs, including costs in the arbitration (extending but not limited to all the fees and expenses of ICSID and the Tribunal and all the legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants, including but not limited to the fees and expenses of counsel), and including the Claimants\u2019 legal costs and expenses incurred consequent upon the expropriation, all with interest calculated in accordance with paragraph (iii) above;\n\n(v) in the event that the Tribunal does not order the Respondent to pay all of the Claimants\u2019 costs in the arbitration, ordering the Respondent to pay all of the Claimants\u2019 costs in connection with the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections and request for bifurcation, including but not limited to all the fees and expenses of ICSID and the Tribunal and all the legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants (including but not limited to the fees and expenses of counsel), with interest calculated in accordance with paragraph (iii) above; and\n\n(vi) ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate.1\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 681; Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 104.\n\n11.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) exclude from the case record any expert report, witness statement produced at the hearing and any other material relating to the submissions made by Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez, in compliance with rule 9.2. (b) of the IBA rules;\n\n(ii) declare that the present dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(iii) declare that the Respondent has not violated the BIT, including Articles 3(1), 3(2), 3(4) and 6 thereof;\n\n(iv) declare that the Claimants are not entitled to any compensation;\n\n(v) order the Claimants to pay all costs relating to this arbitration, including the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s and ICSID\u2019s fees and expenses, and all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with its defence;\n\n(vi) order any such further relief in favour of Venezuela as it may deem appropriate.2\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 192.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated July 20, 2012, with supporting documentation, from the Claimants against Venezuela (the \"Request\" or \"RFA\"). The Request was supplemented by letter dated August 3, 2012.\n\n13.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(c) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 24, 2012, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal be constituted pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Pursuant to Rule 3 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), the Claimants appointed The Honorable L. Yves Fortier Q.C., a national of Canada, as arbitrator.\n\n15.\n\nOn October 31, 2012, the Respondent proposed to the Claimants the appointment of the same tribunal in this case as appointed in the Parallel Arbitration on the basis of the similarities between the two cases. On November 9, 2012, the Claimants rejected the Respondent\u2019s proposal.\n\n16.\n\nOn November 21, 2012, the Respondent appointed Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of France, as arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nOn December 3, 2012, the Claimants expressed reservations to the appointment of Mr. Mourre and requested the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint the presiding arbitrator pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n18.\n\nOn December 27, 2012, the Respondent notified the Centre the appointment of the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP as its counsel of record in the case.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 28, 2012, the Centre, having consulted with the Parties, confirmed that the appointment of the presiding arbitrator would be made in accordance with Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n20.\n\nOn 16 January 2013, in accordance with Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Centre notified the Parties that it intended to propose to the Chairman of the Administrative Council the appointment of Professor Hi-Taek Shin, a national of the Republic of Korea, as the presiding arbitrator in this case, and invited the Parties to submit observations to this proposal. On January 23 and 24, 2013, the Respondent and the Claimants, respectively, submitted their observations on the proposal. On January 28, 2013, Professor Shin submitted comments. On January 30 and February 1, 2013, the Claimants and the Respondent, respectively, submitted further observations.\n\n21.\n\nOn February 6, 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that, after considering the Parties\u2019 observations, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council had decided to proceed with the appointment of Professor Shin as the President of the Tribunal in this case.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 14, 2013, Professor Shin accepted his appointment. On that same date, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Ann Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal held the first session with the Parties in Paris (France) on April 11, 2013.

It was agreed, *inter alia,* that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The agreements of the Parties were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1, dated May 15, 2013.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 15, 2013, the Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits (the \"Claimants\u2019 Memorial\") accompanied by witness statements, expert reports, and factual exhibits.\n\n26.\n\nOn August 16, 2013, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, requesting the bifurcation of the proceeding into jurisdiction and merits phases (the \"Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections\"). Alternatively, the Respondent requested the suspension of the proceeding pending an award in the Parallel Arbitration or during such other time as the Tribunal saw fit.\n\n27.\n\nOn August 30, 2013, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation (\"Claimants\u2019 Response\"), requesting the dismissal of the request and an order from the Tribunal that all confidential information from the Parallel Arbitration disclosed by the Respondent in its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction be struck from the record.\n\n28.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 2 of September 23, 2013, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s Request for bifurcation or for a suspension of the proceeding and the Claimants\u2019 request to strike out from the record the confidential information from the Parallel Arbitration. On October 18, 2013, the Respondent renewed its request for the suspension of the proceeding. On November 25, 2013, the Tribunal rejected Venezuela\u2019s request.\n\n29.\n\nOn December 20, 2013, Venezuela filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (\"Venezuela\u2019s Counter-Memorial\") along with the accompanying exhibits, witness statements, expert reports, and legal authorities.\n\n30.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits and CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction together with the accompanying exhibits, expert reports, witness statements, and legal authorities (the \"Claimants\u2019 Reply\").\n\n31.\n\nOn June 20, 2014, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, together with the accompanying exhibits, expert reports, witness statements, and legal authorities (the \"Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder\").\n\n32.\n\nOn June 21, 2014, the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP informed the Centre of its withdrawal as counsel of record for the Respondent in this case.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, the Respondent notified the Centre the appointment of the law firm of Guglielmino & Asociados S.A. as its new counsel of record in the case.\n\n34.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the \"Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction\"), together with the accompanying exhibits and legal authorities.\n\n35.\n\nOn August 26, 2014, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Mr. Matthew DeDad, one of their witnesses in this arbitration, had been terminated from his employment by Owens Illinois Inc., and indicated that his dismissal was unrelated to this arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nOn September 4, 2014, Venezuela, on the basis of the change in its legal representation in this case, requested a 45-day postponement of the hearing in this case, which was originally scheduled to take place from October 13 to 18, 2014. On September 9, 2014, the Claimants opposed the Republic\u2019s request.\n\n37.\n\nOn September 12, 2014, Venezuela reiterated its request for a 45-day postponement of the hearing dates. On September 15, 2014, the Tribunal granted Venezuela\u2019s request and proposed new dates for the hearing.\n\n38.\n\nOn September 22 and 25, 2014, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively commented on the Tribunal\u2019s decision of September 15, 2014. On September 27, 2014, the Tribunal reaffirmed its decision of September 15, 2015 and invited the Parties to confer and find new dates for the hearing in this case.\n\n39.\n\nOn October 7, 2014, the Parties informed of their availability to hold a hearing during the week of March 30, 2015 in Paris, France.\n\n40.\n\nOn December 14, 2014, the Respondent informed that Mr. Patricio Gran\u00e9 Labat, one of the members of the Claimants\u2019 legal team in this case, had taken part in Venezuela\u2019s defense as a member of his previous law firm and had had access to confidential information relating to Venezuela\u2019s interests and its defense strategy in other ICSID cases. On this basis, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to exclude him as a member of the Claimants\u2019 legal team.\n\n41.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Claimants rejected Venezuela\u2019s allegations regarding Mr. Gran\u00e9 Labat\u2019s acquisition of confidential information regarding Venezuela\u2019s strategy.\n\n42.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, Venezuela requested the Tribunal (i) to exclude from this case Mr. Gran\u00e9 Labat, and the lawyers with access to the information he acquired, from any subsequent procedural instance in representation of interests adverse to Venezuela, (ii) to annul each procedural act that had taken place after Mr. Gran\u00e9 Labat\u2019s incorporation to the Claimants\u2019 legal team, and (iii) to make itself available for a hearing on the matter.\n\n43.\n\nOn January 14, 2015, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to reject the Respondent\u2019s request of December 29, 2014.\n\n44.\n\nOn January 30, 2014, the Parties were informed that Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Ms. Kettlewell as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference on February 9, 2015.

He also informed the Parties that Dechert LLP had within the past year been adverse to Venezuela and/or Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela in six unrelated litigation matters, and confirmed that he would not participate in any work of Dechert LLP with respect to Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela or any other entity related to Venezuela.\n\n47.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, Venezuela indicated that Mr. Mourre\u2019s communication of March 4, 2015 cast serious doubts about his suitability as an arbitrator in any of the cases to which Venezuela was a party, and requested additional information concerning Mr. Mourre\u2019s relationship with Dechert LLP. On March 11, 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal conveyed a further message from Mr. Mourre to the Parties on the scope of his arrangement with Dechert LLP, and invited the Parties\u2019 comments by March 16, 2015.\n\n48.\n\nOn March 13, 2015, Venezuela proposed the disqualification of Mr. Mourre and Mr. Fortier on the basis that each of them lacked the requisite impartiality and independence under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention (the \"Proposal\").\n\n49.\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the Centre transmitted the Proposal to the Parties and the Tribunal informing them that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal for Disqualification was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural schedule for written submissions on the Proposal for Disqualification.\n\n50.\n\nOn March 19, 2015, Professor Shin informed that, in view of the pending challenge, the dates for the upcoming hearing were vacated, and that new hearing dates would be fixed as soon as possible after the resumption of the proceeding.\n\n51.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule, the Claimants submitted a Reply to the Proposal on March 24, 2015 and Mr. Fortier\u2019s furnished explanations pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) on March 30, 2015.\n\n52.\n\nBoth Parties filed simultaneously additional comments on April 14, 2015.\n\n53.\n\nOn April 22, 2015, Mr. Fortier provided further explanations, and both Parties were invited to submit their final comments on the Proposal on April 27, 2015.\n\n54.\n\nOn June 11, 2015, Venezuela submitted a further letter in connection to the Proposal for Disqualification. On June 15, 2015, the Claimants provided comments on this letter.\n\n55.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (i) rejected as untimely the Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Fortier, and (ii) dismissed, in view of his resignation, the Proposal for the Disqualification of Mr. Mourre.\n\n56.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, Prof. Shin and Mr. Fortier informed the Parties that they had decided to consent to the resignation of Mr. Mourre pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2).\n\n57.\n\nOn June 18, 2015, Venezuela requested the Chairman to reconsider its Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification.

Nevertheless, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to address the significance of the findings of the award in the Parallel Arbitration on any potential liability of the Respondent in this case.\n\n66.\n\nOn October 5, 2015, Venezuela responded to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of September 21, 2015, submitting a new Expert Report by Mr. Fabian Bello.\n\n67.\n\nOn October 14, 2015, the Claimants (i) argued that the Respondent had exceeded the invitation of the Tribunal to refer to the impact of the award issued in the Parallel Arbitration, and (ii) requested the Tribunal to set a deadline for the Claimants\u2019 comments on the Respondent\u2019s October 5, 2015 submission. On October 19, 2015, the Respondent submitted further comments on this issue.\n\n68.\n\nOn November 16, 2015, the Claimants filed their Reply to the Respondent\u2019s comments on the relevance of the award rendered in the Parallel Arbitration, along with the accompanying legal authorities.\n\n69.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, the Claimants: (i) requested the Tribunal to confirm that the directions and timeframes contained in Procedural Order No. 7 of February 13, 2015 on the organization of the hearing were to apply *mutatis mutandis* to the upcoming hearing; and, (ii) proposed a series of amendments to the deadlines established in Procedural Order No. 7.\n\n70.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, the Respondent confirmed its agreement with the Claimants\u2019 proposal of January 27, 2016.\n\n71.\n\nOn February 11, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, informing that the Tribunal had decided, on the basis of the agreement reached by the Parties, to modify Sections 1.3, 2.4, 3.1, 5.1, and 7.1 of Procedural Order No. 7, and that the other directions and timeframes contained in Procedural Order No. 7 would continue to apply unmodified to the upcoming hearing in this case.\n\n72.\n\nOn March 2, 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that it had decided to admit the Respondent\u2019s submission of October 5, 2015, including Mr. Bello\u2019s Expert Report.

On December 31, 2005, OIEG acquired the majority shareholdings in OIdV and Favianca.6 However, subsidiaries of Owens Illinois Inc. have held, directly or indirectly, a majority shareholding in OIdV and Favianca for more than forty years. According to the Claimants, Owens Illinois Inc. and its global subsidiaries are together global leaders in the development of the machinery, technical processes and know-how used in the industrial production of glass, and held a strong market position in Venezuela.7\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 17.\n\nCharter & ByLaws of OIdV, incorporation dated April 13, 1956, C-1, p. 4.\n\nCharter & ByLaws of Favianca, incorporation dated August 8,1968, C-2, p. 1.\n\nShare registry of OIdV, C-119, pp. 7-11; Share registry of Favianca, C-120, pp. 6-7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 104.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 investments in Venezuela consisted of the operation of the two largest glass container production and distribution businesses in Venezuela (together, the \"Businesses\" or the \"Plants\"). OIdV\u2019s plant was located in the town of Los Guayos and Favianca\u2019s plant in Valera. According to the Claimants, these Plants were among the most advanced and state-of-the-art glass production and distribution facilities in the world.8\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 20.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants were glass suppliers in the Venezuelan market for major brands such as Heinz, Kraft, Nestle and Gerber, among others.

The Expropriation**\n------------------------\n\n**(1) The Expropriation Decree**\n--------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nOn the evening of October 25, 2010, President Hugo Chavez, made a television broadcast announcing the expropriation of Favianca and OIdV in which he stated:\n\nThe expropriation of this glass company is ready, how is it called? Owens-Illinois! Be it expropriated. [Vice-President] El\u00edas [Jaua] proceed. Owens-Illinois, a company of North American capital that has been here for years, years exploiting its workers, destroying the environment there, in... there, in... in Trujillo.

A few hours later, the workers arrived at the Plants and began protesting against the expropriation outside the facilities. The National Guard remained at the Plants for several weeks.26\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67; Video clip of \"*Trabajadores de Owens Illinois rechazan expropiaci\u00f3n de la empresa*\", dated 27 October 2010, C-43; Transcript of Video clip of \"*Trabajadores de Owens Illinois rechazan expropiaci\u00f3n de la empresa*\", dated October 27, 2010, C-44; Machaen I WS, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 51-52.

He did not intend for the Ministry to take over the management of the Plants in an abrupt and immediate manner. Rather, while the Ministry progressed the legal proceedings necessary to secure the management and, eventually, the compulsory purchase of the Plant\u2019s assets, OIdV and its personnel would continue operating the Plants as usual, whereas the Ministry would limit itself to supervising OIdV\u2019s management activities, without interfering with them but, insofar as necessary, offering OIdV any support requested by its employees. To this end, the next day the Ministry would appoint supervisory bodies tasked with organizing the transition of the management of the Plants.28\n\n*Men\u00e9ndez informa sobre primera reuni\u00f3n entre el Gobierno y Owens*, Video Clip, October 27, 2010, R-115.\n\nPimentel I WS, \u00b6 31.\n\n142.\n\nDuring these exchanges, the Minister stated that \"any action taken with the intention of paralyzing the Plants\u2019 operativity would be considered an act of sabotage.\"29\n\nPimentel I WS, \u00b6 36; Machaen I WS \u00b656.\n\n143.\n\nFurther to this meeting.

The second objective was for all of the knowledge and experience in managing and operating the Plants to be transmitted to a new management team. To do this, the Respondent implemented what was termed \"Operation Mirror\" in the Plants, which consisted of forming a management team comprised of five members of the work force, distinguishing the areas of priority and identifying certain essential profiles. Each of these individuals was required to shadow the corresponding OIdV manager in order to acquire the necessary know-how for managing the Plants autonomously.32\n\nThe priority areas selected were: logistics, sales and marketing, human resources, finance, and plant management.

The INDEPABIS Audits**\n---------------------------\n\n146.\n\nOn October 27 and 28, 2010, the INDEPABIS conducted an audit of Favianca and OIdV respectively, for \"preventative measure[s] for temporary occupancy\" and constituted interim administrative boards for OIdV and Favianca in order to oversee their \"operability, administration, and benefiting.\"33\n\nActa Indepabis (Valera plant), dated October 27, 2010, C-46; Acta Indepabis (Valera plant), dated October 28, 2010, C-52.

The INPSASEL Review and Fine**\n-----------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn November 2010, Venezuela deployed INPSASEL, its occupational health and safety agency, to the Los Guayos plant to conduct a review of historic occupational health and safety compliance by OIdV.34 On August 25, 2011, INPSASEL issued a report proposing sanctions and on August 30, 2011 initiated a sanctions proceeding against OIdV due to the alleged commission of five violations of the Organic Law on Prevention, Working Conditions and the Work Environment (\"LOPCYMAT\").35\n\nINPSASEL Records of November 22, 23 and 29 and December 2, 2010, C-64.\n\nINPSASEL Commencement of Proceedings of August 30, 2011, C-97; INPSASEL Notification to OIdV of August 30, 2011, C-98.\n\n148.\n\nOIdV responded on September 16, 2011, denying any accusation and requesting that the proposed fine be annulled.36\n\nLetter from OIdV to INPSASEL on September 16, 2011, C-99.\n\n149.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, INPSASEL issued an administrative decision indicating that OIdV had not complied with certain provisions of the LOPCYMAT, and imposing a fine of VEB 10,988,550 for such violation.37\n\nINPSASEL Administrative Decision dated February 28, 2012, p. 21, C-106.\n\n**c. The Provisional Remedy granted by the First Administrative Court**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, the Office of the Attorney General filed an application with the First Administrative Court for a provisional remedy consisting of the occupation, possession and use of the movable and immovable properties and improvements presumably owned by OIdV and Favianca.38\n\nJudicial Decision of the First Court for Administrative-Contentious Matters of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas dated December 20, 2010, C-67.\n\n151.\n\nOn 20 December 2010, the First Administrative Court granted the Attorney General\u2019s *ex parte* application and ordered the provisional remedy in favour of Venezuela for the occupation, possession and use of these properties.39\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**d. Visits to the Plants by Third Parties**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nIn November 2010, Venezuela invited a delegation from a Uruguayan company called Envidrio to visit the Plants and inspect the machinery, equipment and processes. A second visit by this same company was arranged in January 2011. The Claimants objected to both visits out of their concern to protect the proprietary information at the Plants.40\n\n*See* Machaen I WS, \u00b6 76.\n\n153.\n\nFollowing this visit, Envidrio produced a preliminary report on the condition of the machinery and equipment at the Plants.41\n\nPreliminary Envidrio Report, R-30\n\n**e. The MINCIT Resolution**\n----------------------------\n\n154.\n\nOn March 15, 2011, as a result of the decision of the First Administrative Court and Article 8 of the Expropriation Decree, MINCIT issued a Resolution to authorize the creation of an *ad hoc* management board to replace the interim boards and to manage \"the companies OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A., Plant OWENS ILLINOIS DE VENEZUELA, C.A. and FABRICA DE VIDRIOS LOS ANDES, C.A. (FAVINCA) [sic]\" with Mr. Alexander Sarmiento as Chairman of this board.42\n\nSee MINCIT Resolution No. 34 dated March 11, 2011, published in Official Gazette No. 39,634 dated March 15, 2011, Articles 1 and 2, C- 79; Sarmiento I WS, \u00b6 23.\n\n155.\n\nOn March 16 and 25, 2011,43 respectively, the Enforcement Courts for the Los Guayos and Valera municipalities enforced the provisional remedy authorised by the First Administrative Court for the occupation, possession and use of the Claimants\u2019 assets; installed the *ad hoc* Management Board; and ordered that the Claimants\u2019 bank accounts could only be used with the express authorization of the *ad hoc* Management Board. At the request of Mr. Sarmiento, the Enforcement Courts granted two consecutive 30-day extensions for each plant.44\n\nJudicial Order of the Tribunal Tercero Ejecutor de Medidas de los Municipios Valencia, Libertador, Los Guayos, Naguanagua, San Diego y Carlos Arvelo de la Circunscripci\u00f3n Judicial del Estado Carabobo, dated March 16, 2011, C-81; Judicial Order of the Juzgado Ejecutor de Medidas de los Municipios Valera, Urdaneta, Escuque, San Rafael de Carvajal y Motat\u00e1n de la Circunscripci\u00f3n Judicial del Estado Trujillo, dated March 25, 2011, C-83.\n\n*Id*., p.3.\n\n**f. The Creation of Venvidrio**\n--------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, President Chavez promulgated Presidential Decree 8,134 in which he established a \"State Company [...] by the name of VENEZOLANA DEL VIDRIO, C.A.\" (\"Venvidrio\") to take over management from the *ad hoc* administrative board in order to produce, manufacture and commercialize glass containers through the Businesses.45 Mr. Sarmiento was appointed President of Venvidrio.46\n\nVenvidrio Decree, Presidential Decree 8,134, Official Gazette Number 39,649, dated 5 April 2011, C-84.\n\nLetter from Owens Illinois Inc. to the Respondent, dated 19 May 2011, C-91.\n\n157.\n\nOn April 30, 2011, Venvidrio directly took over management of the Plants. At that time, the formation of the new boards of directors had been completed and the process of employer substitution from OIdV to Venvidrio had been finalised.47\n\nPimentel I WS, \u00b6\u00b6 58 and 67; Sarmiento I WS, \u00b6 27.\n\n158.\n\nOnce Venvidrio had been formed and a bank account had been opened in its name, the Respondent requested that the Claimants transfer all available cash funds into Venvidrio\u2019s account. After informing the Respondent about the bank accounts that were held in their name and the balances available at the time in those accounts, the Claimants forwarded the cash they held in their bank accounts to Venvidrio\u2019s account.48\n\nLetter from OIdV to the Respondent dated May 13, 2011, C-90; Letter from OIdV to the Respondent dated January 25, 2012, C-104.\n\n**(3) The Expropriation Procedure and the Compensation Negotiations**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Amicable Settlement Phase**\n------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nIn late 2010, Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General sought to commence the Amicable Settlement Phase provided for in the LECUPS. On December 9, 2010, the Claimants wrote to Minister Menendez to express their refusal to participate in any proceeding under the LECUPS,49 and that fair compensation should be determined based on the provisions of the BIT.50\n\nLetter from OIdV to the Respondent dated December 9, 2010, R-20; Cabrera ER, \u00b6 194.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 258; Letter from OIdV to the Respondent dated December 9, 2010, R-20.\n\n160.\n\nOn March 16 and 25, 2011, the Claimants stated before the Enforcement Courts of Los Guayos and Valera, respectively, that they were not going to participate in any court or administrative proceeding initiated by Venezuela in relation to this matter.51\n\nJudicial Order of the Tribunal Tercero Ejecutor de Medidas de los Municipios Valencia, Libertador, Los Guayos, Naguanagua, San Diego y Carlos Arvelo de la Circunscripci\u00f3n Judicial del Estado Carabobo dated March 16, 2011, C-81; Judicial Order of the Juzgado Ejecutor de Medidas de los Municipios Valera, Urdaneta, Escuque, San Rafael de Carvajal y Motat\u00e1n de la Circunscripci\u00f3n Judicial del Estado Trujillo dated March 25, 2011, C-83.\n\n161.\n\nOn March 14, 2011, in view of the fact that the Claimants were not going to participate in the amicable Settlement Phase, the Office of the Attorney General initiated a legal procedure under the LECUPS, filing an expropriation petition with the First and Second Administrative Courts.52\n\nRespondent\u2019s particulars of claim in LECUPS proceedings, dated March 14, 2011, R-31.\n\n162.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, the Trial Court of the Second Court for Administrative-Contentious Matters issued a decision in which it granted the request for expropriation made by the Attorney General and ordered that notice be served to the Claimants so that the respective judicial inspections could be conducted.53\n\n*See* Hern\u00e1ndez I ER, Exhibit 114.\n\n163.\n\nThe expropriation proceeding was subsequently joined with the case involving the provisional remedy that had been authorised by the First Administrative Court (see \u00b6 150 above).\n\n164.\n\nCurrently, the proceedings before the Second Administrative Court are pending.54\n\nHern\u00e1ndez I ER, \u00b6 46.\n\n**b. The Negotiations for Compensation**\n----------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nFrom January to July 2011, the Claimants and Venezuela held four meetings in order to negotiate the compensation due for the Plants.\n\n166.\n\nThe first two meetings were held, respectively, on January 20 and 24, 2011. In the course of these meetings, the Parties agreed on a roadmap for the negotiations.55\n\nSummary of meeting, dated January 20, 2011, C-71; Summary of meeting, dated January 24, 2011, C-72.\n\n167.\n\nAt the third meeting on March 17, 2011, the Claimants presented an appraisal of slightly over USD 1 billion for 100% of the Claimants\u2019 Businesses.56 On July 11, 2011, at the fourth and last meeting, Venezuela made a counter-offer of USD 100-120 million.57 The meeting concluded without any agreement being reached about the amount of compensation payable.58\n\nSummary of meeting, dated March 17, 2011, C-82, p. 1.\n\nSummary of meeting, dated July 11, 2011, C-96.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 141.\n\n**C. Impact of the Parallel Arbitration in this case**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent notes that OIEG has obtained an award in the Parallel Arbitration that covered all of its shareholding in the Claimants, and which amount to 72,983% of the damages sought by the Claimants in this case. Accordingly, the Respondent submits, the Tribunal should consider the outcome of the OIEG Award to avoid double recovery arising from the Parallel Arbitration and the present proceeding, as allowing the Claimants to do so would constitute an abuse of process.59\n\nRespondent\u2019s Comments on the Relevance of the Award issued in the Separate Arbitration, dated October 5, 2015.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the remaining 27,017% of the damages sought in this case would also fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because the ultimate beneficiaries of those shares were not foreign nationals and thus would not meet the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On September 21, 2015, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), the Tribunal decided to dismiss as untimely this jurisdictional objection.60\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that OIEG has not sought any remedy under the ICSID Convention against the OIEG Award and is seeking to enforce it before the United States Courts. Accordingly, the Respondent concludes, OIEG\u2019s consent to the decision made by the tribunal in the Parallel Arbitration would preclude the Claimants from seeking double recovery by making the same claims in this arbitration.61\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n171.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Merits, the Claimants stated \"[t]o the extent that OIEG recovers compensation in that separate arbitration, whether by way of settlement or satisfaction of an award or otherwise, such recoveries shall be set off against the compensation payable to the Claimants in this proceeding.\"62 According to the Claimants, since Venezuela has failed to pay any compensation to OIEG and has initiated annulment proceedings against the award rendered in the Parallel Arbitration, at the moment, there is no need to readjust their claim in this arbitration.63\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 368; *See also* Claimants\u2019 Response, n.118.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Comments on the Relevance of the Award issued in the Separate Arbitration, dated November 16, 2015.\n\n172.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, there is a risk that the Claimants could be deprived of redress and denied justice if the OIEG Award was annulled. Moreover, the OIEG Award did not cover 100% of the Claimants\u2019 businesses expropriated by Venezuela. On this basis, the Claimants state that the Tribunal should exercise its jurisdiction and address any concern of potential double-recovery by specifying in its award \"that the Respondent shall pay compensation to the Claimants equal to: (a) 27,017% of the Tribunal\u2019s valuation of the Claimants\u2019 investment; and (b) 72,983% of the Tribunal\u2019s valuation minus any amounts collected by OIEG pursuant to the *OIEG* Award.\" The Claimants add that, in its Award, the Tribunal could also add a provision stating that \"if the Claimants collect on an award issued by this Tribunal before OIEG collects compensation pursuant to the *OIEG* Award, any amount to be paid to OIEG pursuant to the *OIEG* Award must be reduced by any collections by the Claimants that are above 27,017% of the Tribunal\u2019s valuation in the present case.\"64\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 18.\n\n**D. Venezuela\u2019s Denunciation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nOn April 30, 2008, the Respondent provided to the Netherlands a notice of termination of the BIT.65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Notice of Termination, (2008) Treaties Bulletin of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, No. 124, published on 26 June 2008, CLA-97.\n\n174.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of Article 14(2) of the BIT, the termination took effect six months from the date of the notice. The BIT therefore terminated as of November 1, 2008, subject to Article 14(3) (see below \u00b6 184).\n\n175.\n\nOn January 8, 2012, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas announced that Venezuela would denounce the ICSID Convention.66\n\n*See* Video from Al\u00f3 Presidente Program No. 376 dated January 8, 2012, R-1.\n\n176.\n\nOn January 24, 2012, and pursuant to Art. 71 of the Convention, the Republic formally and irrevocably denounced the Convention through a written notice addressed to the depositary, the World Bank.67 In this notice, Venezuela stated that it was denouncing the ICSID Convention because its provisions were contrary to Article 151 of the 1999 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.68\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Relations of the Republic, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, to the President of the World Bank, Mr. Robert Zoellick, dated January 24, 2012, R-2; \"Venezuela Submits a Notice under Article 71 of the ICSID Convention\", ICSID News Release, 26 January 2012, C-105.\n\nConstitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, dated December 20, 1999, published in the Supplemental Official Gazette No. 5,453, dated March 24, 2000, RLA-1, whose Art. 151 states: \"In the public interest contracts, unless inapplicable by reason of the nature of such contracts, a clause shall be deemed included even if not expressed, whereby any doubts and controversies which may arise concerning such contracts and which cannot be resolved amicably by the contracting parties, shall be decided by the competent courts of the Republic, in accordance with its laws and shall not on any grounds or for any reason give rise to foreign claims.\"\n\n177.\n\nIn its letter of denunciation, Venezuela stated:\n\nBeyond this legal consideration, modern Venezuelan society does not conceive constraints on its ability to make decisions about the great strategic guidelines along which its economic and social life should develop.\n\nAccordingly, the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has implemented policies to reaffirm national sovereignty, especially concerning property of strategic assets, always offering just compensation to the affected individuals and companies.69\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Popular Power for Foreign Relations of the Republic, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, to the President of the World Bank, Mr. Robert Zoellick, dated January 24, 2012, R-2.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione voluntatis* alleging that there was no mutual consent by the Parties to submit the dispute to ICSID before Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012, and that Article 9 of the BIT was rendered ineffective by Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention and therefore does not provide an alternative basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In addition, the Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione temporis* over the investments made by the Claimants after the termination of the BIT.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants, in turn, contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute because, pursuant to Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention only took effect six months after receipt of the notice of denunciation. The Claimants further state that the denunciation of the ICSID Convention cannot limit or qualify the \"unconditional\" consent to arbitrate contained in a BIT and that, accordingly, Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID Arbitration in the BIT subsisted at the time of Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, as to the jurisdictional objection *ratione temporis*, the Claimants investments pre-date the BIT\u2019s termination date and, by operation of Article 14(3) of the BIT, are covered by the protections afforded by the BIT.\n\n**A. The Relevant Provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nArticle 71 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nAny Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\n\n181.\n\nArticle 72 of the ICSID Convention states:\n\nNotice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such notice was received by the depositary.\n\n182.\n\nParagraphs (1) and (4) of Article 9 of the BIT provide:\n\n1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n183.\n\nArticle 14(2) of the BIT reads:\n\nUnless notice of termination has been given by either Contracting Party at least six months before the date of the expiry of its validity, the present Agreement shall be extended tacitly for periods of ten years, each Contracting Party reserving the right to terminate the Agreement upon notice of at least six months before the date of expiry of the current period of validity.\n\n184.\n\nArticle 14(3) of the BIT further provides:\n\nIn respect of investments made before the date of the termination of the present Agreement [the provisions of the BIT] shall continue to be effective for a further period of fifteen years from that date.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n**a. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is clear from Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention that the jurisdiction of ICSID depends upon the existence of mutual consent by the Host State and the investor.70 By operation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, for the rights and obligations of the parties arising out of consent to the ICSID jurisdiction to survive, this mutual consent is to be established prior to the denunciation of the ICSID Convention by the Host state.71\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 12\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 19 and 31-33.\n\n186.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent had already withdrawn from the ICSID Convention when the Claimants consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID on July 20, 2012.72 Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute because the Parties failed to give mutual consent to ICSID jurisdiction prior to Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012.73\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 21\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 34.\n\nScope of Application of Article 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent explains that there exist under the ICSID Convention certain rights and obligations that arise out of the consent of the parties and other rights and obligations that do not arise out of the same, but which nevertheless bind the Contracting States to the Convention.74\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n188.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the rights and obligations arising out of mutual consent to the parties are: \"The right to initiate arbitration (Art. 36); The right to participate in the constitution of the arbitral tribunal (Art. 37); The right to participate in the arbitral proceeding (Arts. 41 and 44); The rights to access the post-award mechanisms of Arts. 49(2) (requiring the Tribunal to rectify errors, or to try a question omitted by the Tribunal); 50 (to request clarification of the award); 51 (to request revision of the award due to the discovery of a fact that would decisively influence the award); and 52 (to request the annulment of an award on certain established grounds); The obligation to abide by and comply with the award (Art. 53); and The obligation to not pursue other remedies, such as diplomatic protection (Arts. 26, 27).\"75\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 24.\n\n189.\n\nThese would be the rights and obligations which Article 72 safeguards from the effects of the denunciation of the ICSID Convention. Article 72 does so by providing, in essence, that the denunciation of the Convention by a Contracting State does not affect the said rights when both parties have given their consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID before the denunciation.76\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 31; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 6.\n\n190.\n\nOn the contrary, Article 71 of the ICSID Convention regulates the effects of the denunciation on those other rights and obligations not arising out of consent of the parties.77\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 25; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n191.\n\nThose rights and obligations are: (i) the right of the Contracting States to participate in the ICSID Administrative Council (Articles 4 to 7); (ii) the right to nominate individuals to the Panel of Conciliators and Arbitrators (Art. 14); and (iii) the obligation to respect the immunities and privileges contemplated in the Convention (Articles 18-24).78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n192.\n\nThe fact that Articles 71 and 72 have different critical dates further evidences that these Articles have different scopes of application and that there can be no overlap between the two provisions. According to the Respondent, \"Article 71 produces its effects six months *after* the date of receipt of the notice of denunciation whereas Article 72 applies to consent performed *unti* l the date of receipt of the notice of denunciation.\"79\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 14 (emphasis in the original).\n\n193.\n\nIn support of this interpretation of Articles 71 and 72, the Respondent cites Prof. Schreuer,80 who describes the relationship between Articles 71 and 72 as follows:\n\nArticle 71 of the ICSID Convention provides that the denunciation of the Convention by a Contracting State takes effect six months after receipt of the notice of denunciation. Therefore, for the period of six months the rights and obligations arising from the Convention continue to apply to the denouncing state, in principle.\n\nArticle 72 contains a different rule on the effective date of the denunciation with respect to consent. If consent was given before the notice of denunciation rights or obligations arising therefrom shall remain unaffected. Therefore, Article 72 modifies the general rule of Article 71 in two ways:\n\na) The critical date for the denunciation\u2019s effect on consent is not the general rule on the taking of effect of the notice of denunciation (6 months after its receipt) but rather the date of its receipt.\n\nb) Rights or obligations arising from consent to jurisdiction remain unaffected by the denunciation even beyond the date the denunciation takes effect i.e. beyond the six-month period.81\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 15. The Respondent notes that Prof. Schreuer\u2019s view is shared by other scholars, and cites to this effect the following articles: Barrie Sanders, Venezuela: the consequences of ICSID Denunciation, in 7 GAR 2, at 4, RLA-104: \"[W]hen read in the context of the ICSID Convention as a whole, the more persuasive view is that the phrase 'consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre' in article 72 refers to the reciprocal consent of the investor and the host state. Several provisions of the ICSID Convention point in this direction. [I]t would be a strange result for a host state to be permitted to withdraw its unilateral consent under article 25(1) prior to such consent being perfected by an investor, but to be bound by that same unilateral consent under article 72 upon denouncing the convention. In addition, article 72 only preserves 'the rights or obligations under this Convention [...] arising out of consent'. Whereas several provisions of the ICSID Convention are triggered by the perfected consent of the investor and the host State.none of [them is] triggered by a mere unilateral consent on the part of the host state. With this in mind, construing the phrase 'consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre' as merely referring to the unilateral consent of a host state would render article 72 meaningless [\u2026].\" Julien Fouret for whom the interpretation whereby Article 72 would require only the unilateral consent of the host State \"is rather a minority view\" (Julien Fouret, Denunciation of the Washington Convention and Non- Contractual Investment Arbitration: \"Manufacturing Consent\" to ICSID Arbitration?, in 25 Journal Of International Arbitration 1, (Kluwer Law International 2008), at 74-75, RLA-11) and Castro de Figueiredo, Roberto, Euro Telecom v. Bolivia: the denunciation of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration under BITs, in 6 Transnational Dispute Management 1, (March 2009) at 14:unilateral consent is an offer to arbitrate which \"does not create [ICSID] jurisdiction unless the investor accepts [it]\", RLA-102.\n\nChristoph Schreuer, Denunciation of the ICSID Convention and Consent to Arbitration, in The Backlash Against Investment Arbitration (Michael Waibel, Asha Kaushal, eds., 2010), at 355, RLA-14.\n\n194.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent continues, since the six-month period established by Article 71 does not extend to the rights or obligations arising out of Venezuela\u2019s consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre, this Article cannot be relied upon by investors to extend the denouncing party\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction beyond the denunciation of the Convention.82\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 16.\n\n195.\n\nFurthermore, under the Claimants\u2019 interpretation, both Article 71 and 72 would have the same purpose *i.e.,* to establish the survival of the State\u2019s consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID during six months after denunciation of the Convention by the State. This interpretation would be \"on its face contrary to basic principles of Treaty interpretation as it denies *in fine* any effectiveness to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.\"83\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 9 (emphasis in the original)\n\nThe ordinary meaning and context of Article 72\n----------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nVenezuela submits that the wording of Article 72 supports its interpretation of this Article, and that the phrase \"*given by one of them*\" in Article 72 can only refer to the parties that can express their consent to submit to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, namely, the Contracting State, its constituent subdivisions or agencies or any national of that State.84\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\n197.\n\nAccordingly, Venezuela continues, Article 72 deals with the consequences of denouncing the Convention only for the denouncing side: the denouncing state as a host State, its entities, and its own nationals as investors in other Contracting States.85\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n198.\n\nOn the basis of this provision, a Contracting State is prevented from relying on the denunciation of another Contracting State \"as an excuse to escape its obligation to arbitrate against a national of that denouncing State who already gave its consent to arbitration,\" and, by the same token, the denouncing State will also \"remain bound in the event its offer of ICSID arbitration is accepted by an investor from another Contracting State before the denunciation.\"86\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 27.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent further notes the Claimants\u2019 argument that Article 72 does not refer to the parties\u2019 mutual consent because of the absence in the text of this Article of the full expression \"mutual consent\", in comparison with the text of Article 25. On the contrary, the Respondent asserts, the principle underlying both Articles is the same: that consent may not be unilaterally withdrawn so long as both parties have already given consent. Article 72 applies the principle of Article 25(1) to the context of denunciation.87\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 28.\n\nThe Drafting History of Article 72\n----------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAccording to Venezuela, the drafting history of Article 72 also supports its interpretation of this provision.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent cites Aron Broches\u2019 opening comment on the discussion about Article 72, in which he stated that Article 72 \"was intended to deal with the effects of denunciation of the Convention. on consents to...arbitration...already given.\"88 The Respondent submits that the use of the passive voice of the plural \"*consents*\" in this sentence could only mean that Mr. Broches was referring to the mutual consent of the parties to arbitration.89\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 30 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent also recalls that, when explaining the purpose of Article 72, Mr. Broches stated that \"the intention.was to make it clear that if a State had consented to arbitration, *for instance by entering into an arbitration clause with an investor*, the subsequent denunciation of the Convention by that Sate would not relieve it from its obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose.\" According to the Respondent, the example given by Mr. Broches in this sentence shows that the intention behind this provision was one where mutual consent is required for Article 72 to apply.90\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 31(emphasis in the original).\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants\u2019 argument according to which Article 72 should apply to consent in both an arbitration clause in a contract and to a general offer to arbitrate in a BIT. According to the Respondent, in his comments, \"Mr Broches was referring to the only situation he had in mind when discussing Article 72: an arbitration clause where there is *already* mutual consent to arbitrate - not an investment treaty.\".91\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 34 (emphasis in the original).\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent also cites the following passage from Mr. Broches\u2019 comments:\n\n[T]he consent of the State may be embodied.in an investment protection treaty with another State, which provides that investors meeting certain conditions or falling within certain categories will have the right to submit investment disputes with the host State to the Centre. The consent of the investor may be evidenced by an express statement to that effect made to the host State, or it may be given at the time when the investor institutes proceedings against the host State. It must, however, be remembered that each party\u2019s consent becomes irrevocable only after both parties have given it. Therefore, in the examples last mentioned, the host State could withdraw its consent as long as the investor had not equally consented.92\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 32 citing Broches, Aron, The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, in Recueil des cours \u2014 Collected Courses of The Hague Academy of International Law 136 (1972-II), at 353, RLA-101\n\n205.\n\nVenezuela contends that this passage shows that \"Mr Broches believed that states could withdraw their consent to arbitration in an investment treaty 'as long as the investor had not equally consented,'\" and that, therefore, \"Article 72 only becomes relevant when the investor [has] 'equally consented'...\"93\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 33.\n\n**b. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction under the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, as a consequence of the denunciation, Venezuela\u2019s consent to arbitrate in Article 9 of the BIT, which was expressly limited to ICSID arbitration, was withdrawn forthwith.94\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 4.\n\nPrinciples of Treaty Interpretation\n-----------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, in Article 9 of the BIT, the Contracting States agreed to submit to arbitration \"*under the Convention*.\" Venezuela examines the ordinary meaning of this word and states that \"*under*\" in Article 9(1) of the BIT means \"arbitration 'as provided for by the rules of' the ICSID Convention.\"95 Accordingly, the consent of the Republic in Article 9 is expressly subject to and conditioned upon the Convention.96\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 48.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 47.\n\n208.\n\nVenezuela further argues that the context of the word *\"under\"* confirms its interpretation. The consent to arbitration expressed in Article 9(4) of the BIT is for the submission of disputes (i) \"as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article\" and (ii) \"in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\" According to the Respondent, this means that Venezuela\u2019s consent to arbitration \"is subject to 'Paragraph 1' and 'the provisions of this article [9]' and hence to the ICSID Convention.\"97\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 49.\n\n209.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent notes that \"before making a reference to 'under the [ICSID] Convention,' paragraph 1 already specifies that disputes are to be submitted to ICSID.\" Accordingly, Venezuela continues, \"if the reference to 'under the ICSID Convention' did not play any limiting role, [\u2026] the wording of paragraph 1 would be redundant.\"98\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 50.\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimants\u2019 interpretation according to which the term \"under\" would explain the mode in which the \"unconditional\" consent to arbitration is to be acted upon, *i.e.,* pursuant to the ICSID Convention, deprives the term \"under the ICSID Convention\" of any real meaning and leads to a result contradictory to the principle of effectiveness.99\n\n*Ibid*, citing Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 34.\n\n211.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues, a review of other BITs concluded by Venezuela, confirms that the use of the word \"under\" (instead of \"established by\" or \"created by\" in other BITs concluded by Venezuela), shows that \"this [was] a \"deliberate choice by the Contracting parties - the Netherlands and Venezuela - to ensure their consent would be subject to the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\"100\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 51.\n\n212.\n\nVenezuela further submits that \"when the Republic denounced the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012, it automatically withdrew its consent to ICSID arbitration under the BIT, and rendered Article 9 of the BIT ineffective. The date of the Republic\u2019s denunciation of the Convention was the last day the Claimants could have accepted the offer to arbitrate in the BIT.\"101\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 52.\n\n213.\n\nVenezuela concludes that the only effect that the denunciation had on the BIT was that consent to ICSID Arbitration in Article 9 was rendered ineffective. The denunciation had no effect on the other provisions of the BIT which, according to Article 14(3) of the BIT, remain in force until 2023.102\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 54.\n\nPrinciple of Effectiveness\n--------------------------\n\n214.\n\nVenezuela argues, in application of the rule of effectiveness or *effet utile,* that the term \"unconditional\" in Article 9 means that \"for as long as the consent is extant, it is unconditional: it is subject to no conditions or qualifications.\" Accordingly, an unconditional consent to arbitration may still be withdrawn.103\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 55-58, citing Yearbook of the International Law Commission (1966) vol. II, p. 219, CLA-118.\n\n215.\n\nOn this point, the Respondent recalls that only two of the 28 bilateral investment treaties entered into by Venezuela provide that consent to arbitration is \"irrevocable\", and the BIT at hand is not one of them.104 Venezuela further submits that \"[i]n an ICSID-only BIT as this one, the spirit of the BIT [\u2026] is to offer recourse to arbitration as long as each Contracting Party to the BIT is willing to remain part of ICSID.\"105\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 56.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 61.\n\nPacta Sunt Servanda\n-------------------\n\n216.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 argument that absence of any recourse to ICSID arbitration in this case would amount to a \"denial of justice,\" the Respondent defends that \"arbitration is not the only means to have claims formed pursuant to the substantive protections offered by the BIT heard and tried,\" and that \"the BIT is part and parcel of the Venezuelan order and the Venezuelan courts have jurisdiction to apply these provisions.\"106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 66.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that \"the consequences of the Compulsory Acquisition of the Plants which are at the core of the Claimants\u2019 case are already before the Venezuelan courts\" and \"the Claimants have deliberately chosen to ignore these proceedings.\" Furthermore, the Respondent adds, the BIT claim arising out of the Compulsory Acquisition of the Plants has already been heard by an ICSID tribunal in the Parallel Arbitration.107\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n218.\n\nVenezuela denies that, as the Claimants allege, it \"does not intend to perform\" Article 9 of the BIT. On the contrary, its position is compatible with the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* as Venezuela is \"fully committed to meeting all of its obligations under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, provided they exist.\"108\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 65.\n\n**(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention establish that, at a minimum an ICSID Contracting State\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration will subsist for six months after a notice of denunciation has been lodged with the World Bank, *i.e.*, until the denunciation takes effect.109 The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute in this case on the basis that at the time the Claimants consented to ICSID jurisdiction on July 20, 2017, the Respondent was still an ICSID Contracting State and its consent to arbitration in the BIT was extant.110\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 116.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 117.\n\n220.\n\nFurthermore, in their Post Hearing Brief, the Claimants stated the following: \"at the Hearing, [\u2026] the Respondent\u2019s witnesses accepted that, in 2011, long before the Respondent\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants had notified the Respondent of their intention to refer the dispute to arbitration under the BIT.\" The Claimants submit that \"that reference can be understood only as consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID and of this Tribunal, with the result that the Claimants and the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration prior to the Respondent\u2019s denunciation,\"111 and that \"the contemporaneous record bears out the fact that the Claimants had expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration repeatedly over the course of late 2010 and early 2011.\"112\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 3 citing Tr.

United States* case before the ICJ, to submit that international jurisprudence relating to the denunciation of treaties confirms this point.122\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 134.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 135.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 136.The Claimants cite, among others, S.

According to the Claimants, \"it does so, by permitting the instrument containing the consent to determine on its own terms how long the consent will last.\" In this case, Articles 9 and 14(3) of the BIT determine that the consent to arbitration runs for a number of years after the instrument of consent is terminated, pursuant to the termination provisions in that instrument, irrespective of the status as a party to the ICSID Convention.123\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 116.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 72 is not, as alleged by the Respondent, that it merely clarifies Article 71, but gives \"independent, albeit related, operation to Articles 71 and 72.\" The fact that the proper interpretation of those provisions leads to the same result in this case does not alter this.124\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 119, referring to the Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9 and 13.\n\nThe Ordinary Meaning and Context of Article 72\n----------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Article 72 does not regulate or specify when consent can be perfected, nor does it require \"mutual consent\" as a precedent condition. Rather the reference to \"consent\" in Article 72 \"relates *only* to a singular consent to ICSID arbitration given by the denouncing State (or the other listed entities connected to it)\".125\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 165 (emphasis in the original).\n\n227.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the words indicates that the word \"them\", as used in Article 72, is a reference to one of the denouncing \"State or. any of its constituent subdivisions of agencies or. any national of that State.\" Accordingly, the Claimants argue, Article 72 cannot refer to the \"consent of current or future investor-claimants that might bring a claim against the denouncing State.\" Consequently, \"if potential investor-claimants are excluded from the concept of 'consent' in Article 72, then 'consent' cannot be a reference to mutual consent.\"126\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 165 and 171.\n\n228.\n\nThe French version of Article 72, which refers to the singular *\"un consentement\",* and excludes the plural \"*consentements*\" that appeared in an earlier draft of that provision, further contradicts the Respondent\u2019s thesis that Article 72 refers to mutual reciprocated consents provided by both of the parties to an ICSID arbitration.127\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 166.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants add that \"authors are overwhelmingly critical of the 'offer and acceptance' theory\" on which the Respondent relies to substantiate its interpretation of Article 72, which is \"predicated entirely upon the minority opinion of Professor Schreuer.\"128 On this point, the Claimants cite, among others, Sourgens,129 who states:\n\n[T]he offer-and-acceptance model is incoherent. Its focus on the relationship between host state and investor blocks out the existing relationship between the host state and the home state. It transforms a three dimensional relationship into a two dimensional playing field.... [D]enunciation of the ICSID Convention cannot have the effect of foreclosing ICSID as a potential forum for dispute resolution under a bilateral investment treaty.... Had the drafters intended what Professor Schreuer submits, Article 72 would have had to read 'given by one of them and a national of another Contracting State or another Contracting State.'... By contextual analysis, the Convention could not be clearer: if a state wishes to withdraw its consent to arbitration, it must do so according to the terms of the consent instrument, not through denunciation of the ICSID Convention.130\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 172 and 176.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 172.\n\nF.

The absence of any \"mutual consent\" condition in Article 72 is a clear indication that no such condition exists in that provision.132\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 185-188.\n\nThe Drafting History of Article 72\n----------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s attempt to invoke Article 72\u2019s drafting history in order to reverse its ordinary meaning, as understood in its proper context, is contrary to Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.133\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 193.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the drafting history of the ICSID Convention \"does not justify the Respondent\u2019s attempt to narrow the scope of Article 72 by focusing on the drafters\u2019 discussion of an agreement between a State and an investor (e.g. a contract) as the source of mutual consent.\"134\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 196.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the paragraph of the drafting history of the ICSID Convention in which Mr Broches refers to the \"consents to... arbitration... already given\" quoted by the Respondent to show that Mr Broches was referring to \"mutual consent\". The Claimants argue that this paragraph is to be read together with Mr Broches\u2019 next comment, *i.e.,* that \"the intention of Article [72]... was to make it clear that if a State had consented to arbitration... the subsequent denunciation of the Convention by that State would not relieve it from its obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose\". These two statements read together would show that Mr Broches was citing the singular consent of the denouncing State as the consent relevant to Article 72.135\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 194-198, citing the History of the ICSID Convention: Analysis of Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, 25 February 1965, vol.

The Claimants add that the Respondent has been unable to cite to the drafting history (or to the text of Article 72) to argue that Article 72 refers to \"mutual consent\" of the kind inherent to a contract between a State and an investor.\n\n**b. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction under the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s \"unconditional\" consent to ICSID Arbitration in the BIT subsisted at the time of Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention.136 The Claimants argue that the BIT contains in its Articles 9(1) and (4) the \"unconditional\" consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID, and that such consent remains in force until the year 2023. The denunciation of the ICSID Convention cannot limit or qualify the \"unconditional\" consent to arbitrate contained in the BIT.137\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6\u00b6 30-35; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 133.\n\nPrinciples of Treaty Interpretation\n-----------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT proposed by Venezuela runs contrary to the object and purpose of the BIT and is not conducted in good faith.138\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 35; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 80.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimants start by noting that, \"the Respondent entirely ignores the meaning and effect of the phrase 'shall at the request of the national concerned.\"139 According to the Claimants, the ordinary meaning of this phrase is that, \"once Venezuela became a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention on June 1, 1995, the only step needed to commence an ICSID arbitration was for an aggrieved investor to request it.\"140\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 51.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimants further state that this is not altered by the word \"under\" in Article 9(1) of the BIT which, in this context, means \"in accordance with\", and not the \"dominance or control\" of the ICSID Convention under the BIT as defended by the Respondent. This term prescribes how Venezuela\u2019s unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration is to be acted upon by a claimant under the BIT, *i.e.,* pursuant to the ICSID Convention.141\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 53.\n\n239.\n\nAs to the other relevant provisions of the BIT, the Claimants state that Article 9(2) and Article 10 of the BIT establish the only temporal condition to the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration. This temporal condition operates so that the ICSID Convention does not apply until the Respondent becomes a party to it, but then continues to apply after it has become a party for as long as the consent to ICSID arbitration given in Article 9(1) is extant.142\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.\n\n240.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s reliance in other BITs concluded by Venezuela, the Claimants submit that other treaties cannot provide interpretative guidance in the construction of the BIT. On this point, the Claimants add that only five of the 29 BITs signed by Venezuela \"use the English word 'under' at the equivalent point of their consent to arbitrate,\" and that, \"in four of those five BITs, the word English 'under' is mirrored in the authentic Spanish version by the words '*de conformidad con*', which means literally, 'in accordance with. '\"143\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 65. The Claimants conclude that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation cannot be considered in good faith as, pursuant to it, \"a single word in Article 9 of the BIT is constructed in a manner that allows a Contracting Party to remove the protections in the BIT by denouncing an entirely separate treaty.\" Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 67.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimants also examine the meaning of the phrase \"unconditional consent.\" On this point, the Claimants submit that \"the ordinary meaning of this phrase is that the Contracting Parties to the BIT agreed that there be no conditions limiting their consent to ICSID arbitration,\" and that \"both the scope of the consent to ICSID arbitration, and the giving of the consent, are complete upon the entry into force of the BIT and upon Venezuela becoming an ICSID Contracting State.\"144\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 70.\n\n242.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants continue, the Respondent\u2019s construction of the word \"under\" in Article 9(1) of the BIT would impose a \"condition subsequent\" on Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration, *i.e.,* Venezuela only consents to ICSID arbitration on the condition that it has not submitted a notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention to the World Bank. This is not a condition expressly or implicitly contemplated by the BIT and would deprive the word \"unconditional\" of any meaning whatsoever.145\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 71.\n\nThe Principle of Effectiveness\n------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 9(1) runs contrary to the principle of effectiveness and deprives multiple BIT provisions of any effect.146 In particular, it denudes the fundamental right it confers on foreign investors to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration of any effect, and renders Article 14(3) a \"dead letter\" as \"there would be nothing of consequence left for Article 14(3) to preserve.\"147\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 80.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 81(c).\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the principle of \"definite limits\" to the rule of effectiveness ensures that a single word in Article 9(1) of the BIT cannot overwhelm either the full text of Articles 9(1), 9(4) and 14(3) or their context. On the contrary, this principle further confirms that the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration given in the BIT survived the Respondent\u2019s notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention.148\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 83.\n\nPacta Sunt Servanda\n-------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT would result in a denial of justice in this case, as these arguments would deprive the Claimants of ICSID arbitration.149\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Tribunal in *Murphy v. Ecuador*150 confirmed that the denunciation of the ICSID Convention by a Contracting State cannot have the effect of revoking the consent to ICSID arbitration given by that Contracting State in a BIT, as this would be contrary to the principle of *pacta sunt servanda.*151 The operation of this principle precludes Venezuela from disregarding the unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration embodied in Article 9 of the BIT.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, December 15, 2010, (*Murphy v. Ecuador*) CLA-234.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-94.\n\n247.\n\nOn the contrary, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of this principle would insulate it from claims under the BIT and thus would deprive the substantive protections contained in the BIT of any meaningful effect.152\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n248.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit, the Respondent\u2019s obligation to respect its unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration is independent of the ICSID Convention. On this point, the Claimants cite Article 43 of the VCLT, which states in relevant part: \"denunciation of a treaty... as a result of the application... of the provisions of the treaty, shall not in any way impair the duty of any State to fulfil any obligation embodied in the treaty to which it would be subject under international law independently of the treaty.\"153\n\nVCLT, Article 43, CLA-2.\n\n249.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"this article is an outgrowth of the principle that the denunciation of a treaty does not impair obligations which a denouncing State has assumed independently of that Treaty.\" Its application to this case means that \"denunciation of the ICSID Convention does not in any way impair the Respondent\u2019s duty to fulfill its obligations under the BIT.\"154\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 105.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela gave notice of its denunciation of the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012. In accordance with Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, that denunciation took effect six months later on July 25, 2012 and hence the Respondent ceased to have rights or obligations as a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention as of that date.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID on July 20, 2012.155\n\nThe Claimants have, in their Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 3, raised a new argument to the effect that their earlier correspondence with the Respondent manifested their consent to ICSID arbitration (*see supra* \u00b6 220). Not only was this point raised very late, it contradicts the Claimants\u2019 earlier position that they consented on July 20, 2012 Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 154, 180. Moreover, the correspondence referred to by the Claimants makes no reference to the ICSID Convention (*see* C-55 and C-58). The Tribunal dismisses this new argument and finds that the Claimants purported to consent to ICSID arbitration on July 20, 2012.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimants submit that either the Republic\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention had no effect on its consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the BIT or that, pursuant to Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, it did not have effect until July 25, 2012, which was after the Claimants consented to the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Respondent submits that the Republic\u2019s denunciation had an immediate impact upon its consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the BIT in so far as, pursuant to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, only existing agreements to submit a dispute to ICSID arbitration survive after a notice of denunciation is received by the depository.\n\n253.\n\nThe core provisions of the two international instruments relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in these proceedings are Article 9 of the BIT and Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. To the extent that the parties have referred to other provisions of the two international instruments to support their interpretations of the aforementioned core provisions, the Tribunal will of course make reference to them as part of the context in its analysis.\n\n**b. Article 9 of the BIT**\n---------------------------\n\n254.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT is alleged to be the primary source of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case. It is reproduced below in full:\n\n1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.\n\n2. As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention as mentioned in Paragraph 1 of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules).\n\n3. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation.\n\n4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n5. The arbitral award shall be based on:\n\n- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;\n\n- the general principles of international law; and\n\n- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.\n\n255.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 position that the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate in Article 9 of the BIT is expressed to be mandatory (\"shall be submitted\") and \"unconditional\", such that it cannot be in any way qualified by actions taken by the Respondent in relation to another international instrument (the ICSID Convention). It thus follows that, according to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the BIT remains binding upon the Respondent until it expires by the terms of the BIT itself, which, in accordance with Article 14 of the BIT, would occur no earlier than November 1, 2023.\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees. According to the Respondent, the consent of the Respondent in Article 9 of the BIT is affected by actions taken by the Respondent with respect to the ICSID Convention. It is the Respondent\u2019s position that this is evident from the text of Article 9 itself, which in subsection 1 refers to the submission of disputes \"under the\" ICSID Convention.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this first issue concerns the legal relationship between two international treaties rather than a question of treaty interpretation in respect of the terms used in Article 9 of the BIT. It is manifest from the express terms of Article 9 that the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration is \"unconditional\" and there is no ambiguity attaching to that consent. The question is, rather, what effect in law does Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention have on Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT?\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that consent to ICSID arbitration has a different juridical character than consent to other forms of arbitration for a simple reason: ICSID arbitration is directly regulated by a multilateral treaty. The multilateral treaty in question\u2014the ICSID Convention\u2014has a legal existence entirely separate from the BIT. The ICSID Convention has its own provisions for determining how and when it is to come into force, how and when amendments are to be made to it and are to become effective, and how and when a Contracting State may withdraw from the treaty and no longer be bound by the obligations thereunder. The state parties to a bilateral investment treaty cannot, in that treaty, purport to amend their rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention, a multilateral treaty. The state parties to a bilateral investment treaty could not, by way of example, purport to contract out of the annulment procedure for ICSID awards set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention by stipulating that any ICSID award rendered by a ICSID tribunal constituted on the basis of the consent to arbitration contained in the investment treaty cannot be the subject of an annulment procedure.\n\n259.\n\nThe situation is very different in relation to other types of arbitration, such as arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, which is obviously another common form of arbitration selected by states as a possible mechanism for the resolution of investor/state disputes in their investment treaties. Arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules is not directly regulated by a multilateral treaty and does not depend upon the existence of a multilateral treaty.156 Consent to the UNCITRAL Rules has the effect of incorporating those rules into the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement and that incorporation would be impervious to any subsequent changes that might be made to the UNCITRAL Rules. The legal operation known as incorporation by reference cannot, however, apply to a multilateral treaty. The ICSID Convention cannot be incorporated by reference into the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement because, as an instrument of international law recording a set of interrelated obligations binding upon all the contracting state parties to it, it has a life of its own. Another way of making the same point: the UNCITRAL Rules do not impose obligations upon anyone unless they are adopted by parties to an arbitration agreement, whereas the ICSID Convention imposes obligations on the Contracting States regardless of whether they are simultaneously parties to arbitration agreements referring to ICSID arbitration. The obligation in Article 54 upon each of the Contracting States of the ICSID Convention to \"recognize an award rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\" is but one of several examples. Furthermore, in contradistinction with an agreement to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention, there is nothing preventing the parties to an agreement to arbitrate under the UNCITRAL Rules from amending those rules or from otherwise contracting out of them in part. In the bilateral investment treaty context, this means that the state parties could consent to investor/state arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules but modify those rules in the provision recording their consent in the investment treaty. Investors would then accept that offer to arbitrate on those terms by commencing arbitration proceedings against the state parties in the usual way.\n\nThis is not to say that the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958) does not play a critical role in supporting arbitrations and arbitral awards under the UNCITRAL Rules. But obviously, the relationship between the New York Convention to arbitrations under the UNCITRAL Rules is altogether different to the relationship between arbitrations under the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the ICSID Convention.\n\n260.\n\nThese fundamental distinctions between consent to ICSID arbitration and to other forms of arbitration such as arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules are reflected in the text of Article 9 itself. Subsection 1 of Article 9 records the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration (i.e. arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the ICSID Convention), whereas subsection 2 recognizes that such consent cannot be operational until Venezuela takes the necessary steps to become a Contracting State under the ICSID Convention. The basic point is that consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT is obviously conditional upon actions taken by the Contracting Parties to the BIT in their capacities as Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. And given that reality, the Contracting Parties to the BIT included an alternative route to investor/state arbitration in subsection 2 in Article 9, which is arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. That form of arbitration is entirely independent of actions taken by Contracting States under the ICSID Convention; indeed, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules have the same juridical status as the UNCITRAL Rules in the context of this discussion.\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal thus rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 9(1) of the BIT is impervious to Venezuela\u2019s actions taken in respect of its obligations under the ICSID Convention. ICSID arbitration is only available if the conditions for access to ICSID arbitration in the investment treaty *and* the ICSID Convention have been satisfied. That is a proposition that is universally accepted in the jurisprudence and is accepted by the parties in the present case.157 It is a proposition that follows inexorably from the fact that the BIT and the ICSID Convention are two separate legal instruments in international law. The fact that each Contracting Party to the BIT gave its \"unconditional consent\" to ICSID arbitration in Article 9(4) is not the end of the inquiry because the Contracting Parties to the BIT cannot in that instrument alter the status or scope of their rights and obligations as Contracting States to the ICSID Convention as a multilateral instrument.\n\nThe Claimants have in their Memorial set out their submissions on why this Tribunal has jurisdiction *both* under the ICSID Convention and the BIT: Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 143-169.\n\n262.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not place emphasis, as the Respondent has urged it to do, on the use of the word \"under\" in Article 9(1) of the Treaty. The stipulation that resort to ICSID arbitration will be made \"under\" the ICSID Convention does not create a relationship of subordination as between the BIT and the ICSID Convention that would not otherwise exist in the absence of this linguistic formulation. It is, moreover, unhelpful to characterize the relationship as one of subordination or supremacy. The basic point is that the conditions for resorting to ICSID arbitration are set out in two separate and wholly independent international legal instruments and both must be satisfied for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction in this case.\n\n263.\n\nFor the purposes of deciding the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection the Tribunal has assumed that all the requirements in the BIT for recourse to ICSID arbitration have been satisfied. It remains to consider the conditions under the ICSID Convention and, in particular, the significance of Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention upon its obligations under that treaty both to the other Contracting States and to nationals of Contracting States involved in ICSID arbitration proceedings against Venezuela. These matters are regulated by Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention, to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n**c. Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nArticles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention are set out in Chapter X of the treaty entitled \"Final Provisions\". As Article 72 also refers to Article 70, the text of all three provisions is set out below:\n\n**Article 70**\n\nThis Convention shall apply to all territories for whose international relations a Contracting State is responsible, except those which are excluded by such State by written notice to the depositary of this Convention either at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval or subsequently.\n\n**Article 71**\n\nAny Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\n\n**Article 72**\n\nNotice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such notice was received by the depositary.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with what is common ground between the parties. As a result of Venezuela\u2019s notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention, which was received by the World Bank on January 24, 2012, Venezuela ceased to be a Contracting State under the ICSID Convention six months later on July 25, 2012 by virtue of Article 71.\n\n266.\n\nThe first difference between the parties is that the Claimants submit that, in accordance with the same provision (Article 71), Venezuela\u2019s denunciation could not have any effect on any ICSID arbitration proceedings commenced before July 25, 2012 and hence could not have any effect on the present arbitration, which was commenced on July 23, 2012 (following the Claimants\u2019 consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID on July 20, 2012). The Respondent counters this by submitting that it is Article 72 that regulates the effect of any denunciation on ICSID arbitration proceedings and not Article 71.\n\n267.\n\nArticle 71 clearly establishes the right of any Contracting State to denounce the ICSID Convention and thus to terminate its obligations towards the remaining Contracting States under the ICSID Convention. In accordance with Article 71, a Contracting State\u2019s withdrawal from the ICSID Convention takes effect six months after the Bank\u2019s receipt of the notice of denunciation. From that date onwards, the State in question will no longer have the right to participate in the Administrative Council (Articles 4-7) or to nominate individuals to the panel of conciliators and arbitrators (Article 13), or to propose amendments to the ICSID Convention (Article 65). That State will also no longer be under a duty to contribute to the financing of the Centre (Article 17), or to accord immunities and privileges to the Centre within its territory (Article 19), or to refrain from exercising diplomatic protection in respect of its nationals (Article 27), or to recognize and enforce ICSID awards within its territory (Article 54), or to submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in respect of any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the ICSID Convention (Article 64).\n\n268.\n\nArticle 72 addresses the consequences of a Contracting State\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention pursuant to Article 71 on that Contacting State\u2019s acceptance of the jurisdiction of the Centre, as well as the acceptance by any constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State.\n\n269.\n\nThis division of labour between Article 71 and Article 72 is important. Article 71 establishes the right of denunciation of the ICSID Convention and regulates the consequences that flow from the exercise of that right in respect of the Contracting State\u2019s position as a state party to the ICSID Convention. This is clear from the ordinary meaning of the terms \"[a]ny Contracting State may denounce this Convention\" in Article 71. Article 72 regulates the consequences that flow from the exercise of the right of denunciation in Article 71 on the Contracting State\u2019s position as a party (or potential party) in an ICSID arbitration. In other words, and for the purposes of this case, Article 71 is addressed to Venezuela as a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, whereas Article 72 is addressed to Venezuela as a party (or potential party) in ICSID arbitrations. This division of labour is not unique to Articles 71 and 72: the contrast between provisions that are addressed to the Contracting States as parties to an international treaty, and provisions that are addressed to parties in ICSID arbitration proceedings, permeates the entire ICSID Convention.\n\n270.\n\nTo adjudge whether Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention has any effect on its position as a party (or as a potential party) to ICSID arbitrations, the Tribunal must, therefore, interpret and apply Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n271.\n\nStarting with the ordinary meaning of the words used in that provision, it is clear that it is addressed to all entities that have the possibility to consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre by virtue of their link to the Contracting State that has denounced the ICSID Convention pursuant to Article 71. Article 72 thus preserves the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre that has been given by the denouncing Contracting State itself, its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State. It is also clear from the express terms of Article 72 that the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre is preserved up until the point in time at which the depository receives the notice of the Contracting State\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention pursuant to Article 71. This means that consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre is preserved if it was given prior to the notice of denunciation being received by the depository in accordance with Article 72, but the Contracting State\u2019s rights and obligations as a party to the ICSID Convention terminate six months later in accordance with Article 71.\n\n272.\n\nThe principal interpretative disagreement between the parties in respect of Article 72 relates to the phrase \"arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them\". The Respondent submits that the reference to \"consent to the jurisdiction\" means an agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre (in other words to a perfected arbitration agreement), whereas the Claimants argue that the same reference is to a party\u2019s own consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre, whether or not that consent has resulted in the formation of an arbitration agreement. If the Respondent is correct, then \"consent\" to the jurisdiction of the Centre in the present case only came into existence when the Claimants consented to ICSID arbitration on July 20, 2012. This would mean that the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction in accordance with Article 72 because Venezuela\u2019s notice of denunciation was received by the depository on January 24, 2012. If the Claimants are correct, then it is Venezuela\u2019s \"consent\" to the jurisdiction of the Centre that counts and that was given in the BIT long before Venezuela sent its notice of denunciation and hence, on that analysis, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\n273.\n\nThe starting point is that the ordinary meaning of \"consent to the jurisdiction\" could encompass either interpretation proffered by the parties because it is perfectly possible to use those words to mean the unilateral act of consenting (i.e. one party\u2019s engagement to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre which needs to be met by another party\u2019s engagement to result in an arbitration agreement) or the multilateral result of consenting (i.e. the one party\u2019s engagement to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre which has been matched by another party\u2019s engagement and as thus resulted in an arbitration agreement). The distinction between \"unilateral consent\" and \"perfected consent\" encapsulates these different possible interpretations. Once the Tribunal moves to the text of Article 72 as a whole and in the context of the other provisions of the ICSID Convention, however, the meaning of \"consent to the jurisdiction\" becomes quite obvious.\n\n274.\n\nFirst, if \"consent to the jurisdiction\" means unilateral consent rather than perfected consent, then there would have been no utility in including the words \"any nationals of [the Contracting] State\" (and probably the word \"agencies\") in Article 72. That is because, unlike for the Contracting State itself, it does not make sense to talk about unilateral consent given by nationals of that State that could generate \"rights and obligations under [the ICSID] Convention\". A Contracting State can give its unilateral consent in a legal instrument such as an investment treaty or in domestic legislation but there is no equivalent possibility for a national of that State to do so. In other words, where a national of the Contracting State gives its \"consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre\" that will always be as perfected consent, either in the form of an arbitration agreement in an investment contract or in the form of an arbitration agreement that comes into existence when a national of one Contracting State accepts another Contracting State\u2019s offer to arbitrate as recorded in an investment treaty or domestic legislation. The principle of *effet utile* requires that the Tribunal interpret Article 72 in such a way so as to give effect to all its terms. The interpretation suggested by the Claimants would deprive the words \"agencies or of any national of that State\" in Article 72 of any utility. (On the Claimants\u2019 interpretation, the reference to \"constituent subdivisions\" might still have meaning because constituent subdivisions could conceivably record their unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre in their own legislation.)\n\n275.\n\nSecond, it is also doubtful whether unilateral consent even given by the Contracting State in an investment treaty or legislation could generate \"rights and obligations under [the ICSID] Convention\" for the purposes of Article 72. Rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention as a party or potential party to ICSID arbitration only arise at the point of perfected consent, i.e. when there is an arbitration agreement in existence. This point can be tested with the following hypothetical: if a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention repealed its own domestic legislation that contained its unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration in circumstances where no national of another Contracting State had ever invoked that unilateral consent, then has that domestic legislation during the period in which it was in force given rise to \"rights and obligations under [the ICSID] Convention\"? The answer must be \"no\" and, if that is the case, the Contracting State\u2019s unilateral consent in an investment treaty cannot fall within the scope of Article 72 because Article 72 only concerns \"consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre\" that has given rise to \"rights and obligations under [the ICSID] Convention\". It follows that the unilateral consent of even the denouncing Contracting State cannot be the object of Article 72.\n\n276.\n\nThird, the relevant context for interpreting Article 72 includes other provisions of the ICSID Convention and in particular the core provision dealing with the \"jurisdiction of the Centre\", which is Article 25. Subsection (1) of Article 25 reads:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n277.\n\nThe \"jurisdiction of the Centre\" is thus founded upon perfected consent and that is hardly surprising as the consent of all parties to ICSID arbitration is the *sine qua non* of arbitration under the ICSID Convention. At first blush it might be thought that this provision uses the term \"consent\" in both senses (i.e. to mean perfected consent and unilateral consent). The phrase \"consent in writing to submit to the Centre\" is equivalent in meaning to an arbitration agreement and thus perfected consent. Is the phrase \"no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\" consistent with the idea of unilateral consent? The answer is not in the sense that it has been advanced by the Claimants and that has formed the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s discussion thus far. Whilst the phrase \"no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\" relates to the possible conduct of one party only, the preceding phrase \"[w]hen the parties have given their consent\" makes it clear that \"consent\" in the final phrase is not directed to the idea of unilateral consent that arises where a Contracting State has given its consent to ICSID arbitration in an investment treaty or domestic legislation. In other words, it is not being used to describe the legal situation created by a unilateral engagement of a Contracting State to submit to ICSID arbitration (but before that engagement is relied upon by a national of another Contracting State). The last sentence of Article 25(1) simply means that where there is perfected consent, it cannot be undone by the conduct of one of the parties.\n\n278.\n\nThe important point to be drawn from this is that nowhere in Article 25, as the core provision governing the \"jurisdiction of the Centre\", or indeed in the rest of the ICSID Convention, is the word \"consent\" used in the sense advocated by the Claimants in their interpretation of Article 72 (i.e. in the sense of unilateral consent). This is further support for reading \"consent\" in Article 72 to mean perfected consent.\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimants have placed certain emphasis on the words \"given by one of them\" in Article 72 as supporting their interpretation that \"consent\" means a unilateral act of one of the named entities or individuals covered by Article 72. The Tribunal is not persuaded that this inference can be drawn as it would be inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s foregoing conclusions on the meaning of \"consent\" in Article 72. Article 72 does not seek to address the rights and obligations of any party that is not the Contracting State which has denounced the ICSID Convention (or one of that Contracting State\u2019s own nationals). Put in another way, Article 72 is not addressed to the counterparties (i.e. another Contracting State or the nationals thereof) to the arbitration agreements entered into with the entities and individuals listed in Article 72. It is logical, then, for Article 72 to refer to the consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction \"given by one of them\" (in the sense of any one of either the denouncing Contracting State, its constituent subdivisions or agencies or a national of that State). In other words, \"given by one of them\" simply confirms that the rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention of the denouncing Contracting State, its constituent subdivisions or agencies or a national of that State that arise out of arbitration agreements to which any of those named entities or individuals has consented are unaffected by that Contacting State\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention.\n\n280.\n\nIt is illuminating to compare Article 72 of the ICSID Convention with Article 66(2), which regulates the effects of amendments to the ICSID Convention to the rights and obligations of all the parties to existing arbitration agreements to submit to ICSID arbitration:\n\nNo amendment shall affect the rights and obligations under this Convention of any Contracting State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies, or of any national of such State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given before the date of entry into force of the amendment.\n\n281.\n\nUnlike Article 72, Article 66(2) is directed to the rights and obligations of both sides to an arbitration agreement to submit to ICSID arbitration and that makes sense because an amendment to the ICSID Convention affects each and every Contracting State. For that reason, the language in Article 66(2) is identical to that of Article 72 save that the words \"by one of them\" is omitted. By contrast, those words make sense in Article 72 because that provision is directed to only one Contracting State and its nationals and it is basically affirming that, despite a Contracting State\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, that Contracting State and its nationals will continue to be bound by arbitration agreements they have entered into prior to the denunciation.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes based upon the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 72 in their context that it is only where consent to arbitration to the jurisdiction of the Centre is perfected, such that it generates rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention, that those rights and obligations persist following the receipt of a notice of denunciation by a Contracting State pursuant to Article 71.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimants have devoted a considerable part of their written submissions to demonstrating that such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, which they broadly assert is to promote foreign investment by creating a mechanism for the binding third party adjudication of investment disputes. In the Claimants\u2019 submission, this object and purpose favours an interpretation that will serve to protect and preserve the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals as far as possible in the face of the denunciation of the ICSID Convention by a Contracting State. Whilst the Tribunal does not necessarily disagree with the Claimants\u2019 formulation of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal cannot accept that it provides support for the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 72.\n\n284.\n\nFirst, it would be very unusual for an appeal to the object and purpose of a treaty to lead to an interpretation that is fundamentally at odds with the ordinary meaning of terms in the context. In the present case, it would compel the Tribunal to accept an interpretation that would render meaningless several words in Article 72 as well as attributing a special meaning to the term \"consent\" that would be inconsistent with the meaning of that term in the core provision on the jurisdiction of the Centre and in the remaining provisions of the ICSID Convention. It would also potentially leave Article 72 without any purpose at all because it is doubtful whether unilateral consent by a Contacting State to ICSID arbitration in an investment treaty or in domestic legislation could give rise to \"rights and obligations\" under the ICSID Convention.\n\n285.\n\nSecond, the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention have specifically agreed that a Contracting State should have the right to denounce the treaty and they have sought to regulate that right. It is not for the Tribunal to second guess the wisdom of Venezuela\u2019s policy that caused it to exercise that right under Article 71. The object of Articles 71 and 72 is to regulate the situation where a Contracting State has elected to exercise its undisputed right to denounce the ICSID Convention and their purpose must be taken to be to ensure that the resulting \"divorce\" is as orderly as possible while protecting vested rights under any existing arbitration agreement with the denouncing Contracting State. No doubt the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention as a whole would be better served if Venezuela did not exercise its right under Article 71 at all, but that is not a factor that is relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Articles 71 and 72.\n\n286.\n\nThe Claimants have also submitted that their interpretation of Article 72 should be preferred because it would ensure that investors could not be \"caught by surprise\" by a Contracting State\u2019s denunciation, which may have effect before the investor could react by commencing ICSID arbitration proceedings by accepting the Contracting State\u2019s offer to submit to ICSID arbitration in an investment treaty. If a Contracting State\u2019s denunciation were to intervene between a dispute arising with the investor and the investor\u2019s filing of a request for arbitration, then it is true that the investor would be deprived of an opportunity to commence ICSID arbitration in those circumstances. This is indeed the situation in which the Claimants find themselves in this case.\n\n287.\n\nOnce again, however, it is not this Tribunal\u2019s function to seek to eliminate any negative consequences that might flow from a Contracting State\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention. Any system of adjudication founded upon consent is vulnerable to the possibility that consent may be withdrawn. The \"optional clause\" vesting the International Court of Justice with jurisdiction in Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute is a pertinent example. Most States that have signed up to the \"optional clause\" have reserved the right to denunciate it at any time. As one commentator remarked:\n\nTo be sure, clauses of that type are regrettable in that they enable States to terminate their acceptance of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction as soon as they sense that an undesirable application might be forthcoming. However, this seems to be the price to be paid for adherence by States to the optional clause. And it corresponds to the logic of a jurisdictional system which is still largely based on unfettered sovereignty.158\n\nZimmermann, Tomuschat, Oellers-Frahm (eds), *The Statute of the International Court of Justice: A Commentary* (OUP, 2006) p. 628.\n\n288.\n\nOf course, a denunciation of the \"optional clause\", just like the denunciation of the ICSID Convention, will not have an impact once proceedings have commenced.159 In the ICSID context, it will not have an impact on existing ICSID arbitration agreements either.\n\n*Nicaragua v. United States*, CLA-130.\n\n289.\n\nArticles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention have to reconcile two different objectives. The first is to facilitate a Contracting State\u2019s orderly exit from the ICSID Convention in case of a denunciation. The second is to protect the legitimate expectations of those who have relied upon that Contracting State\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration. If Article 72 were to be interpreted to extend to potential agreements to arbitrate in addition to existing agreements to arbitrate, it would follow that the Contracting State that has denunciated the ICSID Convention could potentially be the respondent party in an unlimited and unforeseeable number of future ICSID arbitrations for decades after its denunciation comes into effect (*i.e.,* as long as its unilateral consent remained binding in investment treaties). This would be antithetical to an orderly exit from the ICSID Convention. Indeed, it would also impact detrimentally on the other Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. To take but one example, as the denouncing Contracting State would no longer be obliged to contribute to the financing of the ICSID Centre (in accordance with Article 17), it would be the other Contracting States that would in effect subsidize the activities of the ICSID Centre in so far as it relates to a potentially very large pool of future cases against the denouncing Contracting State. On the other hand, if Article 72 extends only to existing arbitration agreements (and pending arbitration proceedings) at the date of the denunciation, as the Tribunal has concluded, there will be a finite and identifiable number of residual cases that will need to run to their conclusion. That is far more consistent with the objective of providing an orderly exit from the ICSID Convention. And the objective of protecting legitimate expectations is also served because any extant ICSID arbitration agreements, whether in investment contracts or concluded on the basis of investment treaties, will also be fully respected.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that a denunciation of the ICSID Convention will rarely come as a complete surprise. The denunciation of an important multilateral convention is a major step for any State to take. The decision is unlikely to be made without debate in the relevant political organs of the State in question. In many States there is a formal constitutional procedure that must be followed. The possibility of investors being caught completely by surprise by a Contracting State\u2019s denunciation is therefore remote.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached a firm conclusion on the proper interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention by resorting to the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT. The Tribunal does not consider that resort to the supplementary means of interpretation in Article 32 is either justified or necessary. Nonetheless, in so far as the parties have made extensive reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* for the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal proposes to make brief observations on the significance of these materials for the interpretation of Articles 71 and 72.\n\n292.\n\nThe critical passages of the discussion in the Legal Committee responsible for drafting the ICSID Convention are set out below:\n\n52. Mr. Broches referred to draft Article 73 [what became Article 72] which had been presented to the meeting and explained that it was intended to deal with the effects of denunciation of the Convention or the exclusion of a territory from the scope of the application of the Convention on consents to conciliation or arbitration under the Convention already given. Mr. Malaplate had proposed a simplification of the language of that article and he would like to consider that drafting point further and to report to the Board at the next session.\n\n53. Mr. Malaplate stated that the proposal he had made could somehow affect the substance of the provision because the article as it stood now did not seem to protect a consent given before denunciation or exclusions if proceedings under that consent had not yet started.\n\n54. Mr. Broches replied that the intention of Article 73 in the text submitted to the Directors was to make it clear that if a State had consented to arbitration, for instance by entering into an arbitration clause with an investor, the subsequent denunciation of the Convention by that State would not relieve it from its obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose. He could not see any difference of substance between the text as it stood and Mr. Malaplate\u2019s proposal but in any case, he would review the language of that article to make sure that the provision was clear.\n\n[... (irrelevant discussion of translation issue)]\n\n57. Mr. Mejia-Palacio asked what would happen if a State which was a party to the Convention signed an agreement with a company and later withdrew from the Centre while no disputes were pending. If, say ten years later a dispute arose - would that dispute still be under the jurisdiction of the Centre?\n\n58. Mr. Broches replied that if the agreement with the company included an arbitration clause and that agreement lasted for say 20 years, that State would still be bound to submit its disputes with that company under that agreement to the Centre.\n\n59. Mr. Mejia-Palacio stated that in certain cases agreement [sic] had no definite duration but provided that they could be terminated by denunciation.\n\n60. Mr. Broches remarked that in the case of an arbitration clause which could be terminated by one of the parties, the jurisdiction of the Centre would come to an end on termination of the clause.\n\n61. Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez Cano said that Article 73 in the new text was lacking a time limit beyond which the Convention would cease to apply. Unless such time limit was introduced States would be bound indefinitely. He had in mind the case in which where was no agreement between the State and the foreign investor but only a general declaration on the part of the State in favor of submission of claims to the Centre and a subsequent withdrawal from the Convention by that State before any claim had been in fact submitted to the Centre. Would the Convention still compel the State to accept the jurisdiction of the Centre?\n\n62. Mr. Broches replied that a general statement of the kind mentioned by Mr. Gutierrez Cano would not be binding on the State which had made it until it had been accepted by an investor. If the State withdraws its unilateral statement by denouncing the Convention before it has been accepted by any investor, no investor could later bring a claim before the Centre. If, however, the unilateral offer of the State has been accepted before the denunciation of the Convention, then disputes arising between the State and the investor after the date of denunciation will still be within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n293.\n\nThese questions and answers during the Legal Committee\u2019s meeting to discuss what became Article 72 of the ICSID Convention confirm the following points:\n\n294.\n\nIf the denouncing Contracting State enters into an agreement with an investor to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration before the notice of denunciation, then the Centre will have jurisdiction over such a dispute after the notice of denunciation (see paragraphs 54, 57 & 58 of the transcript).\n\n295.\n\nIf the denouncing Contracting State had given its unilateral consent to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration before the notice of denunciation and the investor had not accepted it prior to the notice of denunciation, then the Centre will not have jurisdiction over a dispute submitted by the investor after the notice of denunciation (see paragraphs 61 and 62 of the transcript).\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, whilst resort to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* is not justified in accordance with the threshold established by Article 32 of the VCLT, the insights that can nevertheless be drawn from an examination of the *travaux* provide direct support for the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**d. Other Decisions**\n----------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal has approached the questions of treaty interpretation from first principles and thus far without reference to the decisions of other ICSID tribunals. The Parties have brought to the attention of the Tribunal three relevant decisions: *Venoklim v Venezuela*160, *Tenaris v Venezuela*,161 and *Blue Bank v Venezuela*162. The tribunal in *Tenaris* appears to have decided that consent in that case was perfected prior to Venezuela\u2019s notice of denunciation, whereas the tribunals in *Venoklim* and *Blue Bank* came to the opposite conclusion to that of the present Tribunal in relation to the issue under consideration.\n\n*Venoklim Holding B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, Award, April 3, 2015, (*Venoklim v. Venezuela*) CLA-284.\n\n*Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23) Award, December 12, 2016, (*Tenaris v. Venezuela)* RLA-122.\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20), Award and Separate Opinion, April 26, 2017, (*Blue Bank v. Venezuela*) CLA-303.\n\n298.\n\nThis Tribunal is less concerned about recording instances where other tribunals have come to the same or different results and more interested in confronting the reasons that have led tribunals to a different conclusion. The only sustained judicial engagement with the interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 to date is to be found in the Separate Opinion of Mr Soderlund in *Blue Bank.* Mr Soderlund\u2019s agreed with the majority of the tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Venezuela was bound by its consent to arbitrate when the claimant filed a request for arbitration after Venezuela had denounced the ICSID Convention, but disagreed with the majority\u2019s reasoning. It is fair to surmise that the majority\u2019s reasoning was sparse on this point: the tribunal concluded in a single sentence that Article 72 is irrelevant to the question \"*inasmuch as Article 72 deals only with the post-termination survival of certain of a State\u2019s rights or obligations*\".163 There is no analysis of the text of Article 72 and no explanation of how the majority arrived at this conclusion, which is a rather surprising one given the text of Article 72 makes express reference to the Contracting State\u2019s rights and obligations relating to its \"*consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre*\". Hence the Tribunal shares Mr Soderlund\u2019s starting point, which is that \"*the Respondent\u2019s invocation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention requires analysis*\".164\n\n*Bluebank v. Venezuela* \u00b6 108.\n\n*Blue Bank v. Venezuela*, Sep. Opinion, \u00b6 10.\n\n299.\n\nMr Soderlund\u2019s basic thesis is that the \"offer-acceptance\" model is not an accurate reflection of how consent to ICSID arbitration is manifested through an investment treaty.165 Whilst he acknowledges that the wording of Article 25(1) is consistent with that model, he considers that this is explicable by reason of the fact that the drafters would have had investment contracts or *ad hoc* submission agreements in mind rather than investments treaties and hence a literal interpretation of this wording is not appropriate.166 (Although he does concede that the Report of the Executive Directors refers to \"an example of unilateral offer of consent\u2014investment promotion legislation\"167.) He states:\n\n[The \"offer-acceptance\" model] may elicit, erroneously, a perception of the existence of an offer-acceptance relationship between the contracting State and investors of the other contracting State, to the exclusion of the basic State-to-State relationship grounded in the treaty. This, in its turn, may lead to a misapplication in the specific instance of Article 72, as it assumes that there is a unilateral consent given, which will not be perfected until such time as when a particular \"investor\" declares its consent, i.e. accepts the offer. *168*\n\n*Blue Bank v. Venezuela*, Sep. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n*Blue Bank v. Venezuela*, Sep. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.\n\n*Blue Bank v. Venezuela*, Sep. Opinion, \u00b6 36.\n\n*Blue Bank v. Venezuela*, Sep. Opinion, \u00b6 33.\n\n300.\n\nIn the alternative, Mr Soderlund postulates that, in any case, the \"dispute resolution chapter of a BIT constitutes mutual consent for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\" in-and-of-itself.169\n\n*Blue Bank v Venezuela*, Sep. Opinion, \u00b6 39.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal, with all due respect to Mr Soderlund\u2019s sustained treatment of this problem, cannot agree with his analysis.\n\n302.\n\nFirst, it is not permissible, consistently with Article 31 of the VCLT, to dismiss the relevance of the express terms of a treaty on the basis of a supposition that the drafters did not have a particular situation in mind when the ordinary meaning of those terms is clearly capable of extending to that situation. Articles 25 and 72 of the ICSID Convention cannot be emptied of content in relation to investment treaty arbitration, which depends upon the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute no less than any other form of international arbitration. Whilst the manner in which that arbitration agreement comes into existence in investment treaty arbitration may differ from the paradigm of an investment contract (although it is not so different from a situation where the host State\u2019s consent is recorded in investment legislation), the end result is the same and the ICSID Convention is only concerned with that end result. In other words, the ICSID Convention does not purport to regulate the manner in which an arbitration agreement can come into existence; the rights and obligations set out in the ICSID Convention simply do not come into play unless and until it is in existence.\n\n303.\n\nSecond, the consent of each contracting State party to ICSID arbitration in the BIT itself cannot possibly constitute \"mutual consent\" for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. What Mr Soderlund refers to as the \"State-to-State relationship grounded in the treaty\" is no substitute for the necessary existence of an arbitration agreement between the investor and the host State. Mr Soderlund\u2019s theory is flatly contradicted by investment treaty practice. For example, Article 1122 of NAFTA, entitled \"Consent to Arbitration\", reads:\n\n1. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement.\n\n2. The consent given by paragraph 1 and the submission by a disputing investor of a claim to arbitration shall satisfy the requirement of:\n\n(a) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties;\n\n(b) Article II of the New York Convention for an agreement in writing; and\n\n(c) Article I of the InterAmerican Convention for an agreement.\n\n304.\n\nThis provision differentiates between the unilateral consent of the State Parties of NAFTA to arbitration and the manifestation of the investor\u2019s consent by the submission of a claim to arbitration. It confirms that the conjunction of these two different manifestations of consent (i.e. \"offer-and-acceptance\") satisfies the requirement \"written consent of the parties\" (i.e. an arbitration agreement) in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and for the existence of an arbitration agreement under the New York Convention and the InterAmerican Convention. This provision also confirms, if confirmation were really necessary, that investment treaty arbitration is just as dependent on the existence of an arbitration agreement as every other form of international arbitration.\n\n**e. Conclusions**\n------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, on the basis of the foregoing reasons, that it does not have jurisdiction over the dispute that has been submitted to it. In view of this conclusion, the Tribunal will dispense with reviewing the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\n\n306.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal decides that, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on jurisdiction, the Respondent\u2019s pending requests of September 28, October 12, November 2, 2016 and August 4, 2017 have been rejected as moot.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**a. The Parties\u2019 Claims for Costs and Expenses**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on July 8, 2016 and simultaneous reply submissions on September 28, 2016 and May 15, 2017.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Fees and Expenses\n--------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nIn their submission of July 8, 2016, the Claimants contend that they should be awarded the totality of legal fees and expenses, including its own legal fees, experts\u2019 fees, and other disbursements associated with this arbitration, as well as the entirety of the arbitration costs (*i.e.,* costs of the Tribunal and the Centre), in the amount of USD 11,434,636.09.\n\n309.\n\nFurthermore, on September 28, 2016, the Claimants stated that their legal fees and expenses in connection with the Third Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 26,048.07.\n\n310.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, the Claimants stated that their legal fees and expenses in connection with the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 119,725.64.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Fees and Expenses\n----------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nIn its submission of July 8, 2016, the Respondent argues that regardless of the outcome of this case, the Claimants shall bear all costs incurred in these proceedings *i.e.*, its own costs, the arbitration costs, and the Respondent\u2019s costs for a total amount of USD 3,031,233.51.\n\n312.\n\nFurthermore, on September 28, 2016, the Respondent stated that its legal fees and expenses in connection with the Third Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 95,000.\n\n313.\n\nOn May 15, 2017, the Respondent stated that its legal fees and expenses in connection with the Fourth Proposal for Disqualification amount to USD 194,492.\n\n**b. The Costs of the Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses\n\nHi-Taek Shin 239,840.56\n\nL. Yves Fortier 162,315.44\n\nZachary Douglas 95,589.95\n\nAlexis Mourre 57,750.00\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees 160,000.00\n\nDirect expenses 199,600.60\n\n**Total** **915,096.55**\n\n**c. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n316.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal a discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including legal fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with observation that the Respondent has successfully persuaded the Tribunal that it is without jurisdiction in this case. Given that starting point, the Respondent would be entitled to expect to be awarded their reasonable costs in normal circumstances. The Tribunal has come to the conclusion, however, that certain factors militate against the costs-follow-the-event approach in this case. First, there is among ICSID tribunals and commentators a large degree of conflicting views about the proper interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention and their relationship to consent to ICSID arbitration under an investment treaty. The Claimants should not be penalised for this resultant uncertainty and for the fact that this decision on jurisdiction comes at the conclusion of a full examination of the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n318.\n\nSecond, the Respondent has challenged Mr Fortier, a co-arbitrator in this case, on no less than four separate occasions. This generated costs on both sides of several hundred thousand US Dollars. The two remaining arbitrators concluded in their decisions in respect of the Third and Fourth Proposals for Disqualification that the Respondent should bear the costs of each. Hence even if the Tribunal were to award the Respondent a portion of its costs, the costs incurred in relation to the Third and Forth Proposals for Disqualification would have to be set off against this amount in any case and the Tribunal would have to take account of the costs incurred relating to the First and Second Proposals for Disqualification as well.\n\n319.\n\nThird, the Respondent has refused to pay its share of the arbitration costs throughout these proceedings. This has increased the financial burden upon the Claimants in prosecuting this arbitration from the outset and results in a corresponding benefit to the Respondent. This benefit is sufficient recognition of the Respondent\u2019s success in persuading the Tribunal that it is without jurisdiction over the dispute that has been submitted to it. This benefit also meets the Respondent\u2019s argument that it was unreasonable for the Claimants to pursue these proceedings for the full amount of the Claimants\u2019 interest in the Plants when OIEG has already obtained an award that covered all of its shareholding in the Claimants, and which amounts to 72,983% of the damages sought by the Claimants in this case. The Tribunal has some sympathy with the Respondent\u2019s position in this respect, and the question of the *res judicata* effect of the OIEG Award would have been a serious issue for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration had it proceeded to adjudicate the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n320.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal has concluded that each Party should bear its own legal fees and expenses.\n\n321.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration (as reflected in \u00b6 314 above) shall be borne entirely by the Claimants.\n\n**VIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n322.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal is without jurisdiction in respect of the dispute that has been submitted to it;\n\n(2) Each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses.\n\n(3) The Claimants shall bear the costs of the arbitration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2019-11-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**T****able of** **S****elected** **A****bbreviations** **/ D****efined** **T****erms**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Application | F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A.'s Application for Annulment of the Award rendered on November 13, 2017, dated March 9, 2018 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Award | *F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. v.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment (the \"**Application**\") of the award rendered on November 13, 2017 in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/21 (the \"**Award**\") in the arbitration proceeding between F\u00e1brica de Vidrios Los Andes, C.A. (\"**Favianca**\") and Owens-Illinois de Venezuela, C.A. (\"**OIdV**\", jointly with Favianca, the \"**Applicants**\" or \"**Claimants**\") and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Venezuela**\") (the \"**Arbitration**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n3.\n\nThe Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Republic of Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which entered into force on November 1, 1993 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\" or the \"**Convention**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute relates to the expropriation of the two largest glass container production plants in Venezuela, which the Applicants allege was carried out illegally and with no payment of compensation, in breach of several provisions of the BIT.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that it did not have jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it on the basis that there was no mutual consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration due to Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012 (\"**Notice of Denunciation**\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Applicants applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) subparagraphs (b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention, identifying two grounds of annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers, and (ii) failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Registration of the Application and Constitution of the Committee**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn March 9, 2018, the Applicants filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID the Application, including exhibits AA-1 to AA-8.\n\n8.\n\nThe Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\"), within 120 days after the date of the Award.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of March 13, 2018, the Secretariat confirmed receipt of an original of the Application, together with five hard copies and six USB devices containing an electronic copy of the aforementioned document as well as legal authorities AALA-1 to AALA-18.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of March 16, 2018, the Acting Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* committee pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of April 23, 2018, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 52(2), the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties that the *ad hoc* committee (the \"**Committee**\") had been constituted and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date.\n\n12.\n\nThe Committee was composed of Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, Prof. Diego P. Fern\u00e1ndez Arroyo, a national of Argentina and Spain, and Dr. Inka Hanefeld, a national of Germany, designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by Spain, Argentina, and Germany, respectively. Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first session with the Parties on June 12, 2018, at 10:30 a.m. (EDT), by telephone conference (the \"**First Session**\"). In addition to the Members of the Committee and the Secretary of the Committee, participating in the teleconference were:\n\n*On behalf of the Applicants'.*  \nMr. Darrow Abrahams Applicants\u2019 representative  \nMr. Robert Volterra Volterra F ietta  \nMr. Giorgio Mandelli Volterra Fietta  \nMr. \u00c1lvaro Nistal Volterra Fietta  \nMr. Roberto Lupini Volterra Fietta\n\n*On behalf of the Respondent:*  \nMr. Osvaldo Guglielmino Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMr. Diego Gosis Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMs. Ver\u00f3nica Lavista Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMs. Mariana Lozza Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMr. Guillermo Moro Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMr. Pablo Parrilla Guglielmino & Asociados  \nMr. Alejandro Vulejser Guglielmino & Asociados\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the First Session, on June 28, 2018, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Committee on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia,* that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 set forth the procedural calendar.\n\nB. **The Parties\u2019 Written Submissions**\n---------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nPursuant to the procedural calendar, on September 20, 2018, the Applicants filed their Memorial on Annulment (the \"**Memorial on Annulment**\") together with exhibits AA-9 to AA-40 and legal authorities AALA-19 to AALA-110.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 19, 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial to the Applicants\u2019 Application for Annulment (the \"**Counter-Memorial on Annulment**\") together with exhibits RA-1 to RA-22 and legal authorities RALA-1 to RALA-73.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of January 21, 2019, the Applicants submitted procedural objections to the Counter-Memorial on Annulment. The Applicants requested that the Committee strike from the record of this proceeding:\n\n\u2022 Factual exhibits RA-7 and RA-21, both of which are copies of the Counter-Memorial on Annulment filed by OI European Group B.V. on August 6, 2016 in the annulment proceeding in *OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25) (the \"**OIEG Pleading**\"), which the Applicants argued were filed in violation of Sections 15.2 and 15.3 of Procedural Order No. 1;\n\n\u2022 Paragraph 79 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Annulment in which the Respondent made references to the OIEG Pleading; and\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's comments embedded in factual exhibit RA-11, which was the response to the Respondent's request for bifurcation that the Applicants filed in the Arbitration on August 30, 2013.\n\n18.\n\nIn the same letter, the Applicants requested that the Committee take into account the Respondent's procedural violations described in this letter as well as any future procedural violations when it renders its decision on the allocation of the costs of this annulment proceeding.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of January 25, 2019, the Respondent presented its observations to the Applicants' letter of January 21, 2019. The Respondent requested that the Committee:\n\n\u2022 Reject the Applicants' request to strike from the record factual exhibits RA-7 and RA-21 and paragraph 79 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Annulment, because: (a) Sections 15.2 and 15.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 would not be applicable to the OIEG Pleading since this is a document prepared by the Applicants in a proceeding to which Venezuela was also a party, and (b) the Applicants would have the opportunity to argue on the documents and the merits of the Respondent's position in their reply memorial, and\n\n\u2022 Grant authorization to replace factual exhibit R-11 with a clean version of such document.\n\n20.\n\nIn the same letter, the Respondent further requested that the Committee assign to the Applicants the costs arising from this submission at the time of distributing the costs of this annulment proceeding.\n\n21.\n\nAfter considering the Parties' respective positions, on February 1, 2019, the Committee informed the Parties of its decision:\n\n\u2022 To strike from the record of this proceeding: (i) factual exhibits RA-7 and RA-21, and (ii) paragraph 79 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial.\n\n\u2022 To authorize the Respondent to replace factual exhibit R-11 with a clean version of such document in the electronic file-sharing folder created for this case.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, the Applicants filed their Reply Memorial in support of their Application for Annulment (the \"**Reply on Annulment**\") together with exhibits AA-41 to AA-48 and legal authorities AALA-111 to AALA-138.\n\n23.\n\nOn April 24, 2019, the Committee and the Parties were advised that Ms. Sara Marzal Yetano, ICSID Legal Counsel, would be replacing Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 18, 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder to the Applicants' Application for Annulment (the \"**Rejoinder on Annulment**\") without any new exhibits or legal authorities.\n\n**C. The Representation of Venezuela**\n--------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn March 27, 2019, the Secretary-General received a communication (PER-26-2019) from Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez G., professing to act as Special Attorney General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, concerning the representation of the Republic of Venezuela before ICSID. Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez requested that any notice or communication from ICSID to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela should be addressed solely to Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez in his capacity as Special Attorney General of the Republic of Venezuela, and not to any other person claiming to act on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.2\n\nCommunication (PER-26-2019) from Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez to ICSID, March 27, 2019.\n\n26.\n\nOn March 28, 2019, the Secretary-General transmitted Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's communication of March 27, 2019 (PER-26-2019) to the Parties and the Members of the Committee.\n\n27.\n\nOn April 4, 2019, the Committee informed the Parties that it had decided to address the question of the representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in this proceeding as a preliminary matter. Further, the Committee decided to (i) suspend the procedural calendar, and (ii) invite the individuals appearing on behalf of the Applicants, the individuals appearing on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez to file two rounds of simultaneous submissions on the questions raised by Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's communication on April 18 and May 2, 2019.\n\n28.\n\nOn April 4, 2019, Dr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, in his capacity as *Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica (E)*, *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica*, presented a communication addressing Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's communication of March 27, 2019 (PER-26-2019) and the Secretary-General's communication of March 28, 2019.3\n\nCommunication from Dr. Reinaldo Enrique Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza to ICSID, April 4, 2019.\n\n29.\n\nPursuant to the schedule set by the Committee, on April 18, 2019, Dr. Henry Rodr\u00edguez Facchinetti in his capacity of *Gerente General de Litigio*, *Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica*, the Applicants and Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, professing to act as Special Attorney General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, submitted their observations.4\n\nCommunication from Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez to ICSID, April 18, 2019.\n\n30.\n\nOn April 24, 2019, the Committee informed the Parties that it considered the issue of the representation of the Respondent to have been sufficiently briefed and did not wish to receive further communications on this matter.\n\n31.\n\nOn April 29, 2019, the Secretary-General received a communication (PER-55-2019) from Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez following up on his letter of March 27, 2019.5\n\nCommunication (PER-55-2019) from Mr. Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Hern\u00e1ndez to ICSID, April 29, 2019.\n\n32.\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the Secretariat transmitted Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez's communication of April 29, 2019 (PER-55-2019) to the representatives of the parties on record and to the members of the tribunals and annulment committees constituted in each of the cases before ICSID involving the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, including the present annulment proceeding.\n\n33.\n\nOn May 3, 2019, after giving to all involved the opportunity to fully present their positions, the Committee ruled that *\"the evidence on record does not justify a change in the status quo. For this reason, and taking into account considerations of fairness to both Parties and the efficiency of the proceedings, the Committee sees no basis to hold that, for purposes of this annulment proceeding, the representation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has changed.\"* Further, the Committee lifted the suspension of the procedural calendar.\n\n**D.** **The Hearing on Annulment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nBy communication of May 17, 2019, the Secretary of the Committee circulated a draft pre-hearing organizational meeting agenda to the Parties in preparation for the upcoming hearing on annulment. The Parties were invited to confer on the agenda items and to submit, by May 28, 2019, a joint proposal advising the Committee of any agreements they were able to reach, or of their respective positions where they were unable to reach an agreement.\n\n35.\n\nBy communications of May 28 and 29, 2019, the Parties submitted their joint proposal on the procedural matters included in the draft pre-hearing organizational meeting agenda. The Parties reached an agreement on all items in the agenda and therefore requested that, unless the Committee wished to discuss any other procedural matter, the pre-hearing organizational conference meeting be cancelled.\n\n36.\n\nIn light of the Parties' agreements, on May 31, 2019, the Committee cancelled the pre-hearing organizational meeting, and, on June 5, 2019, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 recording such agreements.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter of June 18, 2019, the Applicants requested authorization from the Committee to introduce into the record the \"*Decision on Italy's request for Immediate Termination and Italy's Jurisdictional Objection based on Inapplicability of the Energy Charter Treaty to Intra-EU Disputes*\" issued in *Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50) on May 7, 2019 (\"***Eskosol v. Italy***\").\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of June 24, 2019, the Respondent submitted to the Committee its observations on the Applicants' request of June 18, 2019.\n\n39.\n\nOn June 26, 2019, after considering the Parties' respective positions, the Committee decided to grant the Applicants' request and admit into the record the decision on jurisdictional objections issued in *Eskosol v. Italy*. Pursuant to the Committee's decision, on June 27, 2019, the Applicants submitted into the record such decision (as legal authority AALA-139).\n\n40.\n\nThe hearing on annulment was held in the Bosphorous Room of the Hearing Centre of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris, France, from July 10-11, 2019 (the \"**Hearing on Annulment**\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing on Annulment:\n\n*Committee*:  \nDr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda President  \nProf. Diego P.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAs noted above, the Applicants seek the annulment of the Award on two of the five grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; and (ii) the Award fails to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n44.\n\nBelow is a summary of the Parties' arguments on each of the grounds of annulment invoked by the Applicants.6\n\nThe summary of the Parties' positions that appears below is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of all points that they made, but rather to identify their principal positions. The Committee has taken into account the full range of arguments advanced by the Parties.\n\nA. **Applicants\u2019 Arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n**(1) Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Applicants refer first to the standard applicable for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. This provision requires that the Tribunal has exceeded its powers and that the excess is manifest. With regard to the first requirement, the Applicants affirm on the basis of previous decisions of ICSID annulment committees that a tribunal may exceed its powers if it does not exercise the jurisdiction it has or if it exercises jurisdiction when jurisdiction does not exist.7 Similarly, a tribunal may exceed its powers if it wrongly establishes the relevant facts or fails to apply the proper law.8 While an error of interpretation of the law does not meet the threshold for annulment, a misinterpretation or misapplication may be so gross as to amount to a failure to apply the law, \"*particularly on questions of jurisdiction**\"**9*\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 27.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 28 and 31.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 32.\n\n46.\n\nAs regards the requirement that the excess be manifest, the Applicants refer to the various interpretations of this term by annulment committees: for some, \"manifest\" means that the excess is *\"easily understood or recognized by the mind;\"10* for others, it refers to the extent or consequences of the excess;11 and finally, for a third group, the excess must be both clear and serious.12 The Applicants submit that these nuances of interpretation are immaterial in the present case because the \"manifest\" requirement is met under all of them.13\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 35. The quotation is from *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010, \u00b6 211.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 36.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 38.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 39.\n\n47.\n\nIn their Reply on Annulment, the Applicants reject the Respondent's \"*unduly narrow*\" view on the extent to which annulment committees may review the underlying award under Article 52(1)(b).14 First, the Applicants point out that the *kompetenz-kompetenz* principle does not entail an unlimited degree of deference towards jurisdictional decisions.15 On the contrary, Applicants insist that annulment committees must undertake a full and independent analysis of the applicable rules and facts of the case, particularly as regards jurisdiction.16 Second, the Applicants maintain that the term \"manifest\" does not mean that annulment committees cannot conduct an elaborate analysis of the award.17 Third, the Applicants reiterate that gross errors in the application of the laws may amount to manifest excess of powers.18 In sum, the Applicants contend that \"*in determining whether the Tribunal exceeded its powers, the Committee must review the Tribunal's factual and legal findings, including by assessing whether it 'properly* [\u2026] *appl*[ied] *the relevant rules of interpretation' codified in the VCLT to the BIT and the ICSID Convention*.\"19\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 46.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 48.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 50.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 56 to 62.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 63 to 68.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 69.\n\n48.\n\nThe Applicants argue that, in failing to interpret the BIT and ICSID Convention in accordance with the rules codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), the Tribunal failed to acknowledge its jurisdiction and thus manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n49.\n\nIn particular, the Applicants argue that, by the ordinary meaning of Article 9(1) and (4) of the BIT, the Respondent unconditionally consented to arbitration and that such consent subsists throughout the life of the BIT, but the Tribunal failed to analyze and give effect to the terms of that provision when it stated that the consent was \"*conditional upon actions taken by the Contracting Parties to the BIT in their capacities as Contracting States to the ICSID Convention*.\"20 The Tribunal thereby transformed the unconditional consent in the BIT into a consent entirely conditional on the Respondent's unilateral actions under a different treaty.21\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 49, quoting \u00b6 260 of the Award.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 61.\n\n50.\n\nThe Applicants further argue that the interpretation of the Tribunal is contrary to the context of Article 9(1) and (4) of the BIT, that is, the remaining terms of Article 9 and to the other provisions of the BIT.22 Article 14 is the last article of the BIT and provides that in case the BIT terminates, the previous articles continue to be effective for another 15 years. The interpretation of the Tribunal, which would enable the Respondent to terminate the BIT simply by filing a notice of denunciation for a different treaty, renders Article 14(3) pointless to the extent it applies to Article 9.23\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 62.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 64.\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicants also refer to Article 9(2) of the BIT which applied before Venezuela became a party to the ICSID Convention and provides the consent to arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules. The Applicants argue that \"*for at least as long as the Respondent is a party to the ICSID Convention, those disputes* [disputes under Article 9(1)] *shall be submitted to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 9(1)*.\"24\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 65.\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicants question whether the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 9 meets the requirement of interpretation in good faith.25 It fails as a reasonable interpretation and deprives Article 9 and Article 14(3) of any meaningful effect.26\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 66.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 66.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the Tribunal's interpretation is contrary to the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to encourage and protect investments by providing access to a neutral dispute settlement mechanism (which is what distinguishes a BIT from \"*mere political declarations*\").27 For the Applicants, had the Contracting Parties intended to subordinate access to ICSID arbitration to a possible, future political decision to file a notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention, they would have done so explicitly, as other investment treaties do.28\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 67.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 70. The Applicants cite as an example, Article XII.4(a) of the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed on July 1, 1996 (AALA-49).\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation is also contrary to the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* enshrined in Article 26 of the VCLT because it enables the Respondent to escape its obligation to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Dutch investors.29 It is also contrary to Article 43 of the VCLT, which does not permit that treaty obligations be evaded by indirect means.30\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 71 and 72.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 74.

By straying from its obligation, the Tribunal failed to acknowledge its jurisdiction and manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.*31\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 78. See also Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 74 to 76.\n\n56.\n\nIn their Reply on Annulment, the Applicants argue that the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Annulment fails to rebut any of these points or to engage with the applicable treaty interpretation rules. Instead, its principal response is simply to note that the interpretative issues were already ventilated during the Arbitration. However, the Applicants contend that that does not undermine their arguments.32\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 77 and 79. See also \u00b6\u00b6 80 to 94.\n\n57.\n\nThe Applicants further argue that the Tribunal misinterpreted Article 71 of the Convention in a way that amounts to a disapplication of Article 71.33 The Tribunal saw Article 71 as only regulating the effects from a notice of denunciation in respect of the State as a Contracting State to the Convention and the consequences of the denunciation in an ICSID arbitration as being governed by Article 72. According to the Applicants, this interpretation is contrary to the ordinary meaning of Article 71, in that \"*nothing in Article 71 suggests a notice of denunciation immediately prevents the nationals of other Contracting States from accepting the consent to ICSID arbitration previously given by the denouncing State in other instruments*.\"34 It is also contrary to the context of Article 71. The core jurisdictional provision \u2013Article 25 of the Convention\u2013 does not distinguish between Contracting States that have filed a notice of dispute and those that have not.35\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 85.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 86.

The Applicants contend that \"[t]*hey deliberately chose not to adopt such language*.\"40 They also contend that the Tribunal's interpretation contradicts the customary international law regulating the consequences of a State's denunciation of a treaty as codified in Article 70 of the VCLT.41\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 94.

According to the Applicants, the Tribunal concluded that Article 72 means the opposite of what its clear terms say.42 First, the Tribunal read the words \"*consent \u2026 by one of them*\" to mean \"mutual consent\".43 Second, \"*the Tribunal was not allowed to apply, a contrario, its own misinterpretation of Article 72 to conclude, with no textual basis whatsoever, that the Notice of Denunciation produced effects from the very same day it was received by the depositary, depriving the Six-Month Period in Article 71 of any meaningful effect*.\"44\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 104.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 105.

Instead, they have consistently argued that, \"*pursuant to Article 14(3) of the BIT, the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration 'shall continue to be effective for a further period of fifteen years from* [the date of the termination of the BIT]*.*'\"49\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 182 to 194.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 222 to 227.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 228.

Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 322.\n\n66.\n\nThe Applicants stress that Venezuela's own witnesses admitted in their statements and at the Arbitration hearing that they knew about the Claimants' intention to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration.58\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 247.

Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 293.\n\n67.\n\nThe Applicants point out that this crucial question was disposed of by the Tribunal in a footnote in which it summarily dismissed the Claimants' argument because (i) it contradicted the earlier position of the Claimants, (ii) it was raised late in the proceedings, and (iii) the letters in question did not specifically refer to the ICSID Convention.59 The Applicants contend that none of these reasons are valid. First, the Claimants only became aware of the evidence and the concessions of the Respondent's witnesses at the Arbitration hearing, and the Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief of June 6, 2016 (the \"**Post-Hearing Brief**\")60 was the first procedural opportunity they had to address it.61 Second, the acceptance of Venezuela\u2019s offer cannot be negated by the Claimants\u2019 previous reliance on their July 20, 2012 letter and in their Request for Arbitration of the same date (the \"**Request for Arbitration**\").62 Finally, there is no rule that requires investors to mention the ICSID Convention when they accept the offer of ICSID arbitration.63\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 251.

The Applicants stress that even though the letters were already in the record before the Arbitration hearing, the Claimants could not have made their argument without the confirmations given for the first time at the Arbitration hearing by Respondent's witnesses, because the oral evidence of such witnesses \"*showed that there was\u2014and had been\u2014a 'meeting of the minds' as to the meaning and significance of the Applicant's letters*\". Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 315.

In particular, the Tribunal acknowledged that Article 9 of the BIT was a core provision but failed to apply it.64 The Tribunal also failed to apply Article 71 of the ICSID Convention because it concluded that it was irrelevant for purposes of determining the effects of the Notice of Denunciation.65 Further, the Tribunal misinterpreted and misapplied Article 72 for the reasons already set forth above: it \"*misinterpreted the express terms of Article 72 by concluding that the words 'consent* [...] *by one of them' must refer to 'mutual consent'\",* and *\"based its Award on an impermissible, a contrario interpretation of its misreading of Article 72*\"66\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 263.

The Applicants understand that the legal standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) may be met in multiple ways. First, when the Tribunal fails to deal with an outcome-determinative point defined as \"*a question that either has the potential of altering the tribunal's conclusions or is necessary to understand those conclusions*.\"67 Second, annulment under this ground may also be warranted when the award provides reasons but they are insufficient or inadequate reasons (which are as bad as non-existent reasons).68 Third, the award may also be annulled if it fails to address highly relevant evidence.69 The relevance of the evidence may be determined from \"*an objective standpoint\u2014based on the impact it could have had on the outcome of the proceeding\u2014or from a subjective one \u2013 based on the importance that the parties place on such evidence*.\"70\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 282.

First, the Tribunal did not engage and deal with the outcome-determinative question of the consent of the Claimants before the date of the Notice of Denunciation evidenced in the oral testimony at the hearing. Despite the fact that in their Post-Hearing Brief the Claimants explained that the concessions by the Respondent's witnesses meant that there was no factual basis for the Respondent's jurisdictional objection regarding the effects of its Notice of Denunciation,71 the Tribunal \"*rejected the Applicants' argument without analyzing the critical legal significance of that oral testimony*.\"72 Second, the evidence provided by the Respondent's witnesses was highly relevant, both under an objective or a subjective standard. Yet, the Tribunal did not even mention the crucial piece of oral evidence.73 Third, the Tribunal did not provide adequate and sufficient reasons for its finding that the Applicants' letters did not constitute consent to ICSID arbitration.74 The Tribunal should have \"*(a) set out the rules governing consent under the BIT and the ICSID Convention; (b) analyse both the content of the Letters and the circumstances surrounding their submission to the Respondent; and (c) explain why in its opinion, the Letters failed to meet the applicable legal standard.

Rather, it is a limited remedy to ensure the fairness of the proceeding: *\"In sum, annulment is an extraordinary remedy established as an exception to the finality of awards. Therefore, the grounds for annulment are exhaustive and are aimed at guaranteeing the integrity of the tribunal, the proceedings, and the award*.\"78 Based on the decisions of previous ICSID committees, the Respondent asserts that annulment committees (a) accord a degree of deference to tribunals\u2019 reasonable decisions on jurisdiction,79 (b) may not review a tribunal\u2019s analysis of the facts or the probative value assigned to the evidence on the record,80 (c) may not consider new arguments or evidence not seen or heard by a tribunal,81 and (d) may not review an award because it disagrees with the tribunal\u2019s decision which identified and applied the applicable law.82\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 38 to 74.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 54.

The principle of *stare decisis* does not apply in international law.86 It does not apply to the ICJ either and, in \"*the context of the ICSID Convention, the situation is even more extreme since each arbitral tribunal constituted within the framework of the Convention is an ad hoc tribunal which is constituted solely for the purpose of the relevant dispute, only has competence over that particular dispute, and is not bound by the conclusions reached by other tribunals constituted under the Convention*.\"87\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 100 to 105.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 101.\n\n76.\n\nAs regards excess of powers due to a failure to apply the applicable law, the Respondent affirms that \"*a committee only has jurisdiction to analyze whether the tribunal acted within its competence and is not competent to evaluate which is the most preferable interpretation out of all possible interpretations of the applicable law*.\"88 The Respondent argues that the Applicants simply disagree with the interpretation of the applicable law by the Tribunal, but an annulment committee does not have the power to reinterpret the facts and legal positions already discussed by the Tribunal.89 While the Respondent does not deny that some committees have held that, in exceptional cases, a sufficiently egregious or flagrant error of law could be equivalent to the non-application of the applicable law, these are extreme cases that differ greatly from the mere disagreement regarding the criteria chosen by the Tribunal that the Applicants claim in this case.90\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 107.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 109 to 113.

See also Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 32 to 44.\n\n78.\n\nIn applying the legal standard to the facts of the case, the Respondent claims that the Tribunal applied the proper law in interpreting the BIT and the ICSID Convention. As expressed by the Tribunal, the question to be answered is the effect of Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention on the consent to ICSID arbitration contained in the BIT. The Respondent argues that it is undisputable that the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal requires compliance not only with the BIT in question, but also with the ICSID Convention, as stated by the Tribunal in the Award and recognized by the Applicants.92\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 135 to 139. See also Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 85 to 87.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent defends the distinction made by the Tribunal between Article 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. According to the Respondent, the Applicants are \"*unable to understand the difference between the rights and obligations of Contracting States as Contracting States under the Convention and the rights and obligations of a party to an arbitration under the Convention*.\"93 Further, the Tribunal's analysis of Articles 71, 72 and 25 of the Convention was carried out by the Tribunal in accordance with Article 31 of VCLT; it does not contradict the customary international law on the consequences of denunciation of multilateral treaties, and is consistent with the drafting history of the ICSID Convention.94\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 155.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 144 to 147.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicants' interpretation of Article 71 and Article 72 is mutually inconsistent:\n\n[Applicants] *suggest, on the one hand, that the text of Article 72 of the Convention should be ignored and that the six-month period contained in Article 71 be deemed as a period in which consent may be perfected. On the other hand, they propose an interpretation whereby the consent referred to in Article 72 means unilateral consent, which would allow any investor to accept an open offer to arbitrate at any time. Both interpretations cannot be advanced simultaneously as they are mutually inconsistent.*95\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 211.

Colombia* case is inadmissible because it is a new argument and, in any case, it is mistaken.96 Among other things, the Respondent stresses that the present case does not feature key elements that were present in the *Nicaragua v. Colombia* case, which \"*prevents the consideration that the ICJ's decision supports in any sense the* [Applicants]*' appellatory claim*.\"97\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 213 to 221.

Further, the Respondent stresses that the Applicants have failed to show that the Tribunal's interpretation is untenable or unreasonable and therefore have failed to meet the high standard required for this annulment ground to succeed.100\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 92, 93, 96, 97 and 148.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent also contests the assertion that the Tribunal did not accurately establish the facts as regards the alleged acceptance of the offer to arbitrate the dispute before the filing of the Request for Arbitration on July 20, 2012. The Respondent contends that \"*Claimants*' *mere disagreement with the way in which the Tribunal weighed the arguments and the evidence on the record does not constitute valid grounds for seeking annulment of the Award*.\"101 The Respondent points out that what is now characterized as a fundamental issue was given short shrift throughout the proceeding, and was only briefly raised in the Post-Hearing Brief.102 In contrast, from the time of the Request for Arbitration the Applicants asserted that they gave their consent when they filed the said Request. The Respondent affirms that the \"*Claimants are asking the Committee to annul the Award because the Tribunal established that the facts relating to their acceptance of the offer to arbitrate took place just as Claimants stated during the original proceeding*.\"103\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 233.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 224 and 225.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 245.

The Respondent points out that \"*Mr. Sarmiento's written witness statement is virtually identical to the statement given during his examination at the hearing in this regard*.\"105 The Respondent observes that the written testimony of Mr. Sarmiento had been available since the Rejoinder on the Merits and the letters were on the record long before the Arbitration hearing.106 The Respondent also points out that the Applicants take a position on the admissibility of tardy jurisdictional arguments which contradicts their position in the original phase of the proceeding.107 Furthermore, the letters and the testimony of Messrs. Sarmiento and Pimentel at the hearing fail to refer specifically to ICSID. The Respondent finds this omission significant since Article 9 of the BIT refers to various *fora* and not only to ICSID.108\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 249.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 255.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 255.

The Respondent states, based on the decisions of prior ICSID annulment committees, that this is a minimum requirement which is met *\"when the award allows the reader to follow the tribunal\u2019s reasoning from its legal and factual premises to the conclusion thereof\"**109*The Respondent cautions against using the criterion of insufficiency or inadequacy of the reasons since it may lead a committee to review the merits of the tribunal\u2019s statement of reasons.110 The Respondent contends that a tribunal does not need to comment on all the parties\u2019 arguments nor \"*to give reasons for its reasons* .\"111\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 278.

Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 246.\n\n87.\n\nIn applying the applicable standard to the facts of the case, the Respondent affirms that the Applicants seek to recycle the argument of excess powers into the argument of a failure to state reasons for not having adequately addressed an outcome-determinative issue: the issue of the Claimants\u2019 earlier acceptance of the Respondent\u2019s offer in the BIT.112 The Respondent contends that the Tribunal dealt with this issue, as it has already been explained by the Respondent to rebut the Applicants\u2019 arguments of manifest excess of powers in respect of similar facts. The Respondent affirms that the Applicants in effect request the Committee to conduct the kind of analysis that blurs the distinction between an annulment and an appeal.113\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 295.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 296.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not fail to consider highly relevant evidence.

RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Applicants have requested that the Award be annulled in its entirety, and that they *\"be reimbursed the entirety of the costs and the legal fees incurred by them in connection with this annulment proceeding.\"*115\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 390.\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent has requested that (i) the Applicants\u2019 request be rejected in its entirety, and (ii) the Applicants be ordered \"*to pay all costs and attorneys\u2019 fees arising from this proceeding, including charges for the use of the Centre\u2019s facilities, the ad hoc Committee\u2019s costs and fees, as well as all legal expenses and fees incurred by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in connection with this annulment, with the corresponding application of interest.*\"116\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 298(b).\n\n**V. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nBefore engaging in this analysis, it will be useful to recall a few key dates for the proper understanding of the reasoning of the Committee. Venezuela denounced the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012 by written notice addressed to its depositary. On July 23, 2012, ICSID received the Applicant\u2019s Request for Arbitration dated July 20, 2012. In accordance with Article 71 of the Convention, the denunciation took effect on July 25, 2012.\n\n**A. Nature and Scope of the Annulment Mechanism**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nAs noted in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment of 2016 (\"**Background Paper**\"), \"*assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards was a fundamental goal for the ICSID system*\"117 Thus, annulment is an exceptional remedy limited to the five instances set forth in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The exceptional character of the remedy has been consistently recognized by annulment committees and it is not disputed by the Parties. Similarly, annulment committees coincide in differentiating the annulment remedy from an appeal. Annulment is a remedy \"*to uphold and strengthen the integrity of the ICSID process*\"118 It does not entail a substantive review of the award. The Committee will return to these general themes as needed in considering the grounds on which the Applicants have based their request for annulment, namely, that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and the award failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\nBackground Paper, \u00b6 71.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award rendered on August 20, 2007, August 10, 2010, \u00b6 247(i) (RALA-10).\n\nB. **The Tribunal Has Manifestly Exceeded Its Powers**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) **Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n93.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) of the Convention provides as ground for annulment that \"*the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers*.\" On its plain meaning this sentence means that there has to be an \"excess\" in how the Tribunal has exercised its powers and that this excess must be \"manifest.\" By its ordinary meaning, \"excess\" means \"*more than the proper or specified amount,\"* while \"manifest\" means obvious, readily perceived by the senses, and easily understood or recognized by the mind.119 This is the interpretation given to \"manifest\" by most annulment committees. As noted in the Background Paper, while some committees have interpreted \"manifest\" as requiring that \"*the excess be serious or material to the outcome of the case*,\"120 others have found a link between the two. Thus, the *Libananco* annulment committee held: \"*While the term 'manifest' would in itself seem to correspond to 'obvious' or 'evident,' it follows from the very nature of annulment as an exceptional measure that it should not be resorted to unless the tribunal's act or its failure to act has had, or at least may have had, serious consequences for a party*.\"121 The Committee finds merit in this understanding of \"manifest\" in the context of the exceptional nature of the annulment remedy.\n\nDefinitions taken from the on-line Merriam-Webster Dictionary.\n\nBackground Paper, \u00b6 83.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Excerpts of Decision on Annulment, May 22, 2013, \u00b6 102 (AALA-103). See also *Soufraki*, \u00b6 40.\n\n94.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the Committee should defer to the Tribunal in its decision on jurisdiction on the grounds that the Tribunal has the power to determine its own jurisdiction. The Respondent has relied on the *Azurix* annulment committee that held: \"[i]*f* [\u2026] *reasonable minds might differ as to whether or not the tribunal has jurisdiction, that issue falls to be resolved definitively by the tribunal in exercise of its power under Article 41 before the award is given, rather than by an ad hoc committee under Article 52(1)(b) after the award has been given*.\"122 Article 52(1)(b) does not distinguish between a manifest excess of power in cases of decisions pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and other instances in which this may occur. The Committee would expect that faced with that situation the requirement that the excess be manifest would assist a committee in deciding whether the tribunal acted within the scope of its jurisdiction.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 87, quoting the *Azurix*, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n95.\n\nThe Parties agree that a tribunal may exceed its powers by not applying the proper law, but disagree on whether the erroneous application of the law may amount to a non-application of the law and constitute an excess of powers. As the Respondent itself acknowledges, some committees have held that a gross or egregious misapplication or misinterpretation of the law may lead to annulment while others consider that this approach comes too close to an appeal. The Committee recognizes that sometimes there exists a fine line between a failure to apply the proper law and an erroneous application of the law.123 With this in mind, the Committee remains concerned not to step beyond its mandate and act as an appeal judge when faced with a question of an egregious or gross misapplication of the law. Such would, in the Committee\u2019s view, risk it exceeding its own powers. Thus, in border line situations, the Committee finds it appropriate to recall the limited and extraordinary nature of the annulment remedy.\n\nBackground Paper, \u00b6 93.\n\n(2) **Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Tribunal exceeded its powers because it manifestly failed to exercise its jurisdiction. This contention is based on the treatment by the Tribunal of the Applicants\u2019 supposed notification of their consent to arbitrate prior to the Respondent\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, and on a gross misinterpretation and misapplication of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n97.\n\nThe first leg of the Applicants\u2019 argument questions the appreciation of the evidence before the Tribunal on the timing of the Applicants\u2019 consent. The Committee cannot substitute its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal. The Applicants have argued that an annulment committee must perform *\"an independent analysis\u2019\"* of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules and the particular facts of the case. The Applicants have also argued that a jurisdictional excess of powers may require a finding that the Tribunal wrongly established the relevant facts. There is no support in the case law for such approach. On the contrary, annulment committees have been consistent in holding that the nature of the annulment remedy *\"forbids an inquiry ... on mistakes in analyzing the facts.*\"124 Similarly, annulment committees cannot review the correctness of an award\u2019s findings on facts.125 The role of an annulment committee is limited and should not second guess the evaluation of evidence by the Tribunal.\n\n*Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Ukraine's Application for Annulment of the Award, July 8, 2013, \u00b6 233 (RALA-68).\n\n*Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Annulment, \u00b6 122 (AALA-22).\n\n98.\n\nThe factual question argued by the Applicants is the date on which the Applicants consented to arbitrate the dispute. In the Request for Arbitration, the Applicants have stated that the date of their consent is July 20, 2012. Only in the Post-Hearing Brief did they argue for an earlier date on the basis of 19 letters in which they reserved their rights under the BIT and of alleged concessions of the Respondent's witnesses. The Tribunal dealt with this matter in footnote 155 of the Award. The Applicants take exception to the Tribunal disposing of this \"critical question\" in a footnote.126 The Tribunal notes that the Applicants themselves dealt with this matter in a single paragraph in their Post-Hearing Brief.127 It is not disputed that the argument of the Applicants had not been made before. The Tribunal further notes that the argument was late. The Applicants argue that jurisdictional arguments can be made at any time. Jurisdictional arguments should be made as early in the proceedings as possible128 and certainly not in the Post-Hearing Brief when the other party has no chance to rebut them, and particularly when the argument contradicts the position taken by the Applicants from the start of the proceeding. In any case, the appreciation of the terms of the correspondence and the witnesses' evidence was a matter for the Tribunal and it is beyond the remit of the Committee to revise it now. As stated by the *Caratube* annulment committee, \"[t]*he respect for tribunals' factual findings is normally justified because it is the tribunal who controlled the marshalling of evidence, and had the opportunity of directly examining witnesses and experts*.\"129\n\nSee heading of slide 42 of Applicant's Opening Slides. In fact, as discussed below in paras. 121-122, the footnote refers back to \u00b6 220 of the Award in which the Tribunal sets out in the \"*Claimants' Position\"* section the Claimants' arguments concerning the Respondent's witnesses' concessions. Further, footnote 111 in \u00b6 220 of the Award refers to the transcript from Day 3 of the Arbitration hearing in which the concessions apparently arose.\n\nPost Hearing Brief, \u00b6 3 (Exhibit AA-40).\n\nArbitration Rule 41(1).\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on the Annulment Application of Caratube International Oil Company LLP, February 21, 2014, \u00b6 158 (AALA-105).\n\n99.\n\nThe second ground adduced by the Applicants is that the Tribunal misinterpreted and misapplied the law. There is no dispute as regards the applicable law but only on its interpretation and application. The Tribunal determined that the core provisions relevant to the jurisdictional proceedings are Article 9 of the BIT and Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention, which the Committee reproduces here for convenience.\n\n100.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT:\n\n*1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965.*\n\n*2. As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention as mentioned in Paragraph 1 of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules).*\n\n*3. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation.*\n\n*4. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in Paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*5. The arbitral award shall be based on:*\n\n*- the law of the Contracting Party concerned;*\n\n*- the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;*\n\n*- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;*\n\n*- the general principles of international law; and*\n\n*- such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.*\n\n101.\n\nArticle 71 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depository of this Convention. The Denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.*\n\n102.\n\nArticle 72 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n*Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of the constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such notice was received by the depository.*\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt first with the issue of whether actions taken by the Respondent with respect to the ICSID Convention affect the Respondent's consent to arbitrate under Article 9 of the BIT. According to the Tribunal, this issue \"*concerns the legal relationship between two international treaties rather than a question of treaty interpretation in respect of the terms used in Article 9 of the BIT*.\"130 The Tribunal then notes that consent to ICSID arbitration has a different juridical character than consent to other forms of arbitration because ICSID arbitration is regulated by a multilateral treaty. The Tribunal explains:\n\n*The ICSID Convention has its own provisions for determining how and when it is to come into force, \u2026 how and when a Contracting State may withdraw from the treaty and no longer be bound by the obligations thereunder. The state parties to a bilateral investment treaty cannot, in that treaty, purport to amend their rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention, a multilateral treaty.*131\n\nAward, \u00b6 257.\n\nAward, \u00b6 258.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the distinctions between the consent to ICSID arbitration and to other forms of arbitration are reflected in the text of Article 9 itself, which in paragraph 2:\n\n*recognizes that such consent* [to ICSID arbitration] *cannot be operational until Venezuela takes the necessary steps to become a Contracting State under the ICSID Convention. The basic point is that consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT is obviously conditional upon actions taken by the Contracting Parties to the BIT in their capacities as Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. And given that reality, the Contracting Parties to the BIT included an alternative route \u2026 arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules*.132\n\nId., \u00b6 260.\n\n105.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Tribunal rejects the contention that the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 9(1) of the BIT is \"*impervious to Venezuela's actions taken in respect of its obligations under the ICSID Convention. ICSID arbitration is only available if the conditions for access to ICSID arbitration in the investment treaty and the ICSID Convention have been satisfied. That is a proposition that is universally accepted in the jurisprudence and is accepted by the parties in the present case*.\"133\n\nId., \u00b6 261, emphasis added.\n\n106.\n\nThe Committee recalls the standard discussed in paragraph 95 above. Leaving aside the Committee's views on whether the Tribunal's interpretation is correct or not, the Committee finds that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 9 of the BIT is reasonable and tenable and, therefore, cannot amount to manifest excess of powers.\n\n107.\n\nThen the Tribunal turns to Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. According to the Tribunal, Article 71 addresses Venezuela as a Contracting State and Article 72 as a potential party in ICSID arbitrations. Hence, \"[t]*o adjudge whether Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention has any effect on its position as a party (or as a potential party) to ICSID arbitrations, the Tribunal must, therefore, interpret and apply Article 72 of the ICSID Convention*.\"134 The Tribunal proceeds to interpret the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 72 and refers to the principal interpretative disagreement between the Parties that concerns the phrase \"*arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them*.\" The Tribunal reasons that \"*the ordinary meaning of 'consent to the jurisdiction' could encompass either interpretation proffered by the parties because it is perfectly possible to use those words to mean the unilateral act of consenting \u2026or the multilateral result of consenting* \u2026\"135 To decide between the two alternatives, the Tribunal analyzes the phrase in question in the context of Article 72 and of other provisions of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal favors the interpretation of perfected consent and explains the reasons why: first, it does not make sense to talk about unilateral consent given by nationals of the Contracting State that could generate rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention; second, even a Contracting State's \"*rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention as a party or potential party to ICSID arbitration only arise at the point of perfected consent*;\"136 and third, in terms of the overall context of the ICSID Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre under Article 25(1) is founded upon perfected consent. The Tribunal also analyzes the phrase \"*given by one of them*\" because of the emphasis placed on this phrase by the Applicants. It also considers Article 72 in the context of Article 66(2). After it reaches its conclusion based on the ordinary meaning and the context of Article 72, the Tribunal turns to the Applicants' argument that the proffered interpretation would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\nId., \u00b6 270.\n\nId., \u00b6 273.\n\nId., \u00b6 275.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Applicants' argument does not support the Applicants' interpretation of Article 72. The Tribunal explains why: First, \"*it would be very unusual for an appeal to the object and purpose of a treaty to lead to an interpretation that is fundamentally at odds with the ordinary meaning of terms in the context*.\"137 Second, \"*the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention have specifically agreed that a Contracting State should have the right to denounce the treaty and they have sought to regulate that right*.\"138 The Tribunal also considers the argument that the Applicants' interpretation should be preferred because, under such interpretation, the investors would not be surprised by the Convention's denunciation. The Tribunal explains that it is not its function to eliminate any negative consequences that might flow from the denunciation of the ICSID Convention. Withdrawal of consent is an eventuality in any adjudicating system founded on consent.\n\nId., \u00b6 284.\n\nId., \u00b6 285.\n\n109.\n\nAt this point in its reasoning the Tribunal notes that it has \"*reached a firm conclusion on the proper interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention by resorting to the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT*.\"139 Although it considered it unnecessary, the Tribunal also resorted to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* for the ICSID Convention because the Parties had made extensive references to them. In this respect, the Tribunal observed that \"*whilst resort to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires is not justified in accordance with the threshold established by Article 32 of the VCLT, the insights that can nevertheless be drawn from an examination of the travaux provide direct support for the Tribunal's interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention*.\"140\n\nId., \u00b6 291.\n\nId., \u00b6 296.\n\n110.\n\nAs in the case of Article 9 of the BIT, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal's interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 is well reasoned and grounded in the text of the ICSID Convention by applying the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT. Consequently, it does not constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal.\n\n111.\n\nThe Applicants have argued that the Tribunal disregarded the decisions of other tribunals which decided the same issue. It is well known that there is no *stare decisis* in international law. Tribunals are independent from each other and not bound by other tribunals' decisions. The Committee concurs in that it is desirable to develop a *jurisprudence constante* by consideration of precedents and explanation in what aspects they are similar or need to be distinguished from the instant case. However, the standing of precedents is not at the level of the applicable law. To ignore them just by itself would not be tantamount to an egregious misapplication of the law. In any event, the Tribunal took into account and analyzed previous decisions on the same issue, as explained in the next paragraph.\n\n112.\n\nIn fact, the Tribunal considered three of the awards of other tribunals brought to its attention by the Parties.141 Generally, the Tribunal commented that it was \"*less concerned about recording instances where other tribunals have come to the same or different results and more interested in confronting the reasons that have led tribunals to a different conclusion*.\"142 The Tribunal noted that the *Tenaris* tribunal decided that consent was perfected before the Convention was denounced and therefore it was not relevant to the issue discussed. As regards the other two cases (*Blue Bank* and *Venoklim*), they reached opposite conclusions to that of the Tribunal. In analyzing those cases, the Tribunal found that \"[t]*he only sustained judicial engagement with the interpretation of Articles 71 and 72 to date is to be found in the Separate Opinion of Mr S\u00f6derlund in Blue Bank*.\"143 The Tribunal observed that the majority concluded in a single sentence that Article 72 was irrelevant, while Mr. S\u00f6derlund thought that \"*the Respondent's invocation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention requires analysis\"**144* The Tribunal goes on to consider arbitrator Soderlund\u2019s analysis and explains why it does not agree with him. The Committee finds significant that the Tribunal in particular addressed the analysis that it found to reflect *\" sustained judicial engagement\"* even when it was only a Separate Opinion.\n\nId., \u00b6 297, referring to *Venoklim Holding B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/22, Award, April 3, 2015, (*Venoklim v.

The Award Failed to State the Reasons on Which It Is Based**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Applicants agree with the Respondent\u2019s statement in the Counter-Memorial on Annulment that \"*the statement of reasons is an essential element of the awards issued by tribunals constituted under the ICSID Convention\";* it *\"ensures that the parties to arbitration can understand the decisions entered by the tribunals and the reasons why those decisions have been adopted, in order to ensure respect for the right to due process and the right to defence* .\"145\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 348 quoting the Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 275.\n\n115.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Respondent unduly raises the threshold for annulment under Article 52(1)(e), an argument disputed by the Respondent. The differences between the Parties concern the extent to which a tribunal needs to address every argument advanced by the Parties, to address highly relevant evidence, and to provide sufficient or adequate reasons.\n\n116.\n\nOn the first point, the Parties seem to agree that tribunals are not required to deal with every argument but they should address outcome-determinative arguments.146 The Committee recalls the explanation of the *Libananco* annulment committee: *\"[L]ack of consideration of a question submitted to a tribunal could amount to a failure to state reasons if no reasons are given by the tribunal for not addressing the question and such question would be determinant for understanding the reasoning of the award*.\"147\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 352.\n\nQuoted in Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 351.\n\n117.\n\nAs regards the arguments on the need for a tribunal to address \"*highly relevant evidence,*\" the Applicants explain that a tribunal does not need to address all pieces of evidence, but *\"those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion*.\"148 The Respondent seems to agree, \"[t]*he* [Applicants] *have also conceded in their last presentation that tribunals don't have the obligation to analyze each piece of evidence included in the proceedings*.\"149\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 358, quoting *TECO*.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 247.\n\n118.\n\nWhile the Tribunal should address highly relevant pieces of evidence, the question for the Committee is the extent of its role in reviewing the Award and its factual underpinnings. The Applicants have quoted with approval the *Suez* annulment decision statement that there may be a failure to state reasons \"*only if there was a total failure to address evidence that would have been 'highly relevant' to the Tribunal's decision, i.e., evidence whose consideration could have had a significant impact on the Award*.\"150 The Committee's concern on this matter is that it is not in the remit of the Committee to judge \"*the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value*,\" a task reserved to the Tribunal in the Arbitration Rules.151 While the \"total failure\" to address evidence may be so obvious that it may fit within the Committee's purview, how the Tribunal appreciates the probative value of the evidence would be beyond the Committee's competence.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 360.\n\nAccording to Arbitration Rule 34(1): \"*The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value*.\"\n\n119.\n\nThe third point discussed by the Parties relates to whether insufficiency or inadequacy of reasons warrants the annulment of an award. The Respondent finds support in *Vivendi I* for the proposition that, as a general rule and absent exceptional circumstances, insufficient reasons do not constitute a ground for annulment.152 In turn, the Applicants recall that the *Vivendi I* annulment committee explained that exceptional circumstances are present if the \"*decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale*\" and \"*the point* [is] *itself* [\u2026] *necessary to the tribunal's decision*.\"153 However, the Committee recalls that the extent of insufficiency and inadequacy required to justify annulment on this basis is a matter of debate.154 In this respect, the *MINE* annulment committee held that the \"*adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review*.\"155\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, \u00b6 65 (AALA-6).\n\nQuoted in the Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 362.\n\nBackground Paper, \u00b6 106.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award dated January 6, 1988, December 14, 1989, \u00b6 5.08 (hereinafter *MINE*) (AALA-14).\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent has relied on the *MINE* annulment committee to argue that the requirement to state reasons is a minimum requirement that allows the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal as it progresses from point A to point B.156 The Applicants have explained that subsequent annulment committees have clarified the scope of the minimum requirement and adduce as an example the decision of the *Soufraki* annulment committee.157 While that committee may have clarified the meaning of minimum requirement, it has not changed it in substance. Indeed, it refers to a total absence of reasons, frivolous reasons, a failure to state reasons for a particular material point or insufficient reasons to explain the result arrived at by the tribunal.158\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 282.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 364.\n\n*Soufraki*, \u00b6 126, cited in the Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 364.\n\n121.\n\nThe Applicants take exception to the argument of the Respondent based on the decision in *TECO* that a more nuanced approach is necessary when dealing with allegations of insufficient and inadequate reasons. The Applicants point out that the *TECO* annulment committee concluded that \"*insufficiency of reasons can lead to annulment* [\u2026] *when a tribunal did provide some explanations for its decision, but these are insufficient from a logical point of view to justify the tribunal's conclusion*.\"159 Again, this is not substantially different from the holding of the *MINE* annulment committee. Indeed, if reasons are \"*insufficient from a logical point of view,\"* they will not enable the reader \"*to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion*.\"160 In the Committee\u2019s view, the understanding of the standard developed by the *MINE* committee is difficult to improve on.\n\nQuoted in the Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 366.\n\n*MINE*, \u00b6 5.09.\n\n(2) **Application of the Legal Standard to the Present Case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Applicants allege that the Tribunal failed to engage with the Applicants\u2019 argument regarding the oral testimony of two witnesses that confirmed, according to the Applicants, that the Applicants had consented to ICSID arbitration before the Notice of Denunciation. The Applicants clarified that they do not challenge the probative value given by the Tribunal to the oral testimony of the two witnesses; rather, the Applicants\u2019 *\"argument is that the Tribunal completely disregarded that oral testimony without any analysis and without explaining why it found it insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory.\"*161\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 377.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"[i]*t becomes evident that the Tribunal pondered the argument and expressed its conclusions on the matter, referring explicitly to the position of the Claimants and the evidence that it considered relevant to make that decision.\"**162* The Respondent affirms that the correctness or persuasiveness of the reasoning of the Tribunal is not relevant. The Respondent contests the Applicants\u2019 argument that the Committee has authority to assess the sufficiency or adequacy of the reasons. The Respondent adds that the letters written to the Respondent and attached to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits of July 15, 2016 (as Exhibits C-55 and C-58) are barely mentioned in subsequent memorials of the Claimants and not one is characterized in those memorials as a letter of acceptance of an offer of arbitration under the ICSID Convention.163\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 262.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 270.\n\n124.\n\nThe Committee notes that, on this point, the Award describes the Claimants' position by reference to the Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction of August 21, 2014: \"[t]*he Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute in this case on the basis that at the time the Claimants consented to ICSID jurisdiction on July 20, 2017* [*sic*], *the Respondent was still an ICSID Contracting State and its consent to arbitration in the BIT was extant*.\"164\n\nAward, \u00b6 219, citing the Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction of August 21, 2014, \u00b6 117. The date in this paragraph of the Award is incorrect. The correct date is July 20, 2012.\n\n125.\n\nThen the Tribunal quotes in full the paragraph in the Post-Hearing Brief setting forth the position of the Claimants in the arbitration proceeding:\n\n*Furthermore, in their Post Hearing Brief, the Claimants stated the following: 'at the Hearing, [...] the Respondent's witnesses accepted that, in 2011, long before the Respondent's denunciation of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants had notified the Respondent of their intention to refer the dispute to arbitration under the BIT.' The Claimants submit that 'that reference can be understood only as consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID and of this Tribunal, with the result that the Claimants and the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration prior to the Respondent's denunciation,' and that 'the contemporaneous record bears out the fact that the Claimants had expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration repeatedly over the course of late 2010 and early 2011.'*165\n\nAward, \u00b6 220 The quotations within the text can be found in footnote 111 in Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 3 citing the Arbitration hearing transcript (Tr. Day 3, 103:10-106:11, and Tr. Day 3, 292:1-5), and in footnote 112 in the Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 3, citing letter from OIdV to the Respondent dated November 8, 2010, p. 5, exhibit C-55, and letter from OIdV to the Respondent dated November 12, 2010, p. 4, exhibit C-58.\n\n126.\n\nAs part of the Tribunal's analysis, the Tribunal dismissed the new argument raised by the Applicant's in the Post-Hearing Brief in footnote 155 of the Award. According to the Tribunal, (i) this point was raised very late, (ii) it contradicted the Claimants' earlier position that they consented on July 20, 2012, and (iii) the correspondence referred to by the Claimants made no reference to the ICSID Convention. In dismissing the new argument, the Tribunal cross-referred to the paragraph where the Tribunal copied the new argument (para. 220), to the paragraphs of the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits of July 15, 2016 where the Claimants had held their previous position (paras. 154 and 180), and to the exhibits where the letters of the Claimants to the Respondent may be found (C-55 and C-58).166\n\nAward, footnote 155 to \u00b6 251.\n\n127.\n\nThe new argument was founded on the acceptance by the Respondent's witnesses that \"*the Claimants had notified the Respondent of their intention to refer the dispute to arbitration under the BIT*.\"167 It is notable that the letters and the written witness statements were part of the arbitration file since submission of the Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits of June 20, 2014, which means that the Claimants could have developed their position in their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction of August 21, 2014. It is difficult for the Committee to discern the significance given by the Applicants in this proceeding to the testimony of the witnesses as compared to their written statements. It is evident that, even by the Claimants' own words, the Claimants had only notified the Respondent of their intention to refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\nSee \u00b6 122 above.\n\n128.\n\nAs part of their contention that the Tribunal gave no reasons, the Applicants also emphasize that the Tribunal did not even mention the oral testimony. The Committee observes that paragraph 220 of the Award is based on the oral testimony. The quotations within that paragraph are precisely from the transcripts of the hearing and the letters of the Claimants to the Respondent. Thus, the Tribunal considered the new argument and justified its rejection. In the view of the Committee, the reasoning in the Award allows the reader to follow how the Tribunal reached its conclusion.\n\n129.\n\nTo conclude, the Committee finds that there is no merit in the Applicants' claim that the Award should be annulled for failure to state reasons.\n\n**C****OSTS**\n-------------\n\n130.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n131.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applicable to this proceeding under Arbitration Rule 53), grants discretion to the Committee to determine the allocation of costs it deems appropriate in the present proceeding.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee has decided to reject the Application for Annulment and, accordingly, the Applicant shall bear all fees and expenses of the Committee Members, and ICSID's administrative fees and expenses. On the other hand, while the alleged grounds for annulment have been rejected by the Committee, they raised fundamental questions related to the denunciation of the ICSID Convention by Venezuela which justify that each Party shall bear all expenses incurred in connection with its own defense.\n\n133.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):168\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Committee's fees and expenses |  |\n| Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda | 75,242.50 |\n| Diego P.

The remaining balance shall be reimbursed to the Applicants.\n\n**VI.
