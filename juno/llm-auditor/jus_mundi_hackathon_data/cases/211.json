INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 18 March 1998, entered into force on 29 September 1999 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Infinito Gold Ltd. (\"Infinito\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by:\n\nMr. John Terry   \nMs. Myriam   \nM. Seers   \nMr. Ryan Lax   \nMs. Aria Laskin   \nTorys LLP   \n79 Wellington Street West, Suite 3000   \nBox 270, TD Centre   \nToronto, ON   \nCanada, M5K IN2\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Costa Rica (\"Costa Rica\" or the \"Respondent\"). The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by:\n\nMr. Paolo Di Rosa   \nMr. Ra\u00fal Herrera   \nMr. Csaba Rusznak   \nMs. Natalia Giraldo-Carrillo   \nArnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP   \n601 Massachusetts Avenue NW   \nWashington, DC 20001-3743   \nUnited States of America   \nMr. Dmitri Evseev   \nMr. Patricio Gran\u00e9 Labat   \nArnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP   \nTower 42, 25 Old Broad Street   \nLondon, EC2N1Q   \nUnited Kingdom   \nMs. Adriana Gonz\u00e1lez   \nMs. Arianna Arce   \nMs. Francinie Obando   \nMs. Marisol Montero   \nMinisterio de Comercio Exterior de Costa Rica   \nPlaza Tempo, sobre la Autopista Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez, contiguo al Hospital Cima   \nPiso 3   \nSan Jos\u00e9   \nRepublic of Costa Rica\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute arises out of the development of a gold mining project in the area of Las Crucitas, in Costa Rica (the \"Las Crucitas Project\").\n\n6.\n\nThe present decision concerns the Respondent's preliminary objections.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Registration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 6 February 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated also 6 February 2014 from the Claimant against Costa Rica, together with exhibits C-001 to C-008 (the \"Request for Arbitration\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 March 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Institution Rules\").\n\n9.\n\nIn accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Bernard Hanotiau, a national of Belgium, appointed by the Claimant; and Brigitte Stern, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n11.\n\nOn 29 September 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 29 September 2014, the President of the Tribunal proposed to the Parties the appointment of an assistant to the Tribunal. Both Parties confirmed their agreement on that same day.\n\n13.\n\nOn 9 December 2014, with the approval of the other Members of the Tribunal, the President of the Tribunal proposed that Ms. Sabina Sacco be appointed as the assistant to the Tribunal. On 12 January 2015, both Parties approved the appointment.\n\n**B. First Session**\n--------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), and in accordance with the Parties' agreement to extend the 60-day deadline set forth in Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 22 January 2015 by telephone conference.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 17 February 2015, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 on behalf of the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages are English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceeding is Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the Procedural Calendar for the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings.\n\n**C. Parties' Written Submissions and Procedural Applications**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 June 2015, following a request from the Claimant agreed upon by the Respondent, the Tribunal amended the Procedural Calendar (\"Revision No. 1\"). According to the revised Procedural Calendar, the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits was due on 10 July 2015.\n\n17.\n\nOn 13 July 2015, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties observing that the Claimant had failed to file its Memorial on the Merits on the due date and inviting explanations from the Claimant, to be followed by observations from the Respondent.\n\n18.\n\nOn 15 July 2015, the Claimant's counsel provided explanations relating to its inability to obtain client instructions as a result of the resignation of all of the Claimant's directors and officers. The Claimant's counsel requested a temporary suspension of the Procedural Calendar.\n\n19.\n\nFollowing an invitation from the Tribunal, on 24 July 2015, the Respondent opposed the suspension request, and asked the Tribunal to declare the Claimant in default under ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3). In addition, the Respondent sought an order for discontinuance of the proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 (the \"Respondent's Request for Discontinuance\"). In the alternative, the Respondent sought an order for security for costs (the \"Respondent's Request for Security for Costs\") coupled with a revision to the Procedural Calendar. The Respondent's submission was accompanied by one legal authority.\n\n20.\n\nOn 27 July 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide by 10 August 2015 observations on the Respondent's Requests for Discontinuance and Security for Costs.\n\n21.\n\nOn 10 August 2015, the Claimant's counsel requested an extension of the deadline to file its observations, citing again inability to obtain client instructions as a result of the Claimant's lack of directors and management.\n\n22.\n\nOn 14 August 2015, the Respondent stated that it did not consent to the extension request, and insisted that the proceeding be discontinued \"immediately\" pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, on grounds of lack of opposition from the Claimant. The Respondent also raised a further issue relating to the transfer of certain property in Costa Rica.\n\n23.\n\nOn 20 August 2015, the Tribunal granted the Claimant an extension until 1 September 2015 to provide observations on the Respondent's Requests for Discontinuance and Security for Costs of 24 July 2015, and the transfer of property issue raised in the Respondent's letter of 14 August 2015. On 1 September 2015, the Claimant's counsel informed the Tribunal that it still was not in a position to receive client instructions to respond, and reiterated the request for a temporary suspension of the Procedural Calendar. On 1 September 2015, the Respondent provided further observations on the matter.\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 September 2015, the Tribunal gave the following directions to the Parties:\n\n[...]\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot order the discontinuance requested by the Respondent. This request has been made under Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which addresses discontinuance of the proceedings at the request of a party. According to the Explanatory Notes to Rule 44 in the 1968 version of the Rule (which is identical to its 2006 version), 'under this Rule the agreement (express or implied) of both parties must be secured for discontinuance' (Note C). The Claimant has not consented to the discontinuance, neither expressly nor impliedly. To the contrary, although it has not made a formal objection, it has stated that 'a discontinuance of the proceeding [\u2026] would cause significant prejudice to the Claimant.' The Tribunal understands this to be an implied objection.\n\nThat being said, the present state of uncertainty cannot last indefinitely. As noted in the Explanatory Notes cited above, 'this Rule provides that if either party wishes to discontinue the proceeding unilaterally, the acquiescence of the other party must be obtained; but, so as not to permit such party to block a discontinuance by inaction, intentional or unintentional, a time limit is to be set for its response' (Note B). The Tribunal already set one time limit for this purpose, of which the Claimant now requests an extension. Given the special circumstances surrounding the Claimant's corporate organization and management, the Tribunal is willing to extend this deadline for an additional three weeks, *i.e*. until 29 September 2015. If by then the Claimant does not indicate clearly whether it wishes to pursue this arbitration and present a formal objection to the discontinuance requested by the Respondent, the Tribunal will apply Rule 44 and deem that the Claimant has acquiesced in the discontinuance.\n\nThe Respondent's request for security for costs is deferred until the Tribunal's final ruling on the discontinuance, if at that stage the request remains applicable.\n\n25.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, the Claimant filed a submission in response to the Respondent's Requests for Discontinuance and Security for Costs, and renewed its request for a temporary suspension of the Procedural Calendar. This submission was accompanied by exhibits C-008 to C-012,1 and legal authorities CL-001 to CL-014.\n\nThe document designated as C-008 differs from another document previously submitted using the same numerical designation. *See supra,* \u00b6 7.\n\n26.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's Requests for Discontinuance and Security for Costs. The Tribunal further invited the Parties to confer and submit by 16 October 2015 a joint proposal for a revised Procedural Calendar, or individual proposals if an agreement was not possible.\n\n27.\n\nFollowing various requests for extension, on 6 November 2015, each Party filed a communication to the Tribunal setting forth its position concerning the Procedural Calendar. The Claimant submitted an additional communication on 7 November 2015, and the Respondent on 9 November 2015.\n\n28.\n\nOn 10 November 2015, the Tribunal ruled on the Parties' disagreement over the timetable, and established a new Procedural Calendar (\"Revision No. 2\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 23 December 2015, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits, accompanied by exhibits C-001 to C-350;2 legal authorities CL-001 to CL-100;3 two (2) witness statements, by Mr. Eric Rauguth and Mr. Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez, respectively; and two (2) expert reports by FTI Consulting Inc. and Roscoe Postle Associates Inc., respectively.4\n\nThe same documents designated as exhibits C-001 to C-008 had been previously submitted. *See supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 25.\n\nThe documents designated as CL-001 to CL-014 in this submission differ from those previously submitted under the same numerical designation. *See supra*, \u00b6 25.\n\nOn 26 December 2015, the Claimant submitted a Revised CER-RPA 1 and a Revised CER-FTI Consulting 1. On 6 January 2016, with the Respondent's agreement, the Claimant submitted a Revised Memorial on the Merits.\n\n30.\n\nOn 14 January 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had entered into a funding agreement with Vannin Capital PCC in connection with the present proceeding. On 18 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that no conflict arose for any of the Members of the Tribunal as a result of this arrangement. It further invited the Respondent to provide any observations it may have in connection with the Claimant's third party funding arrangement within one week. No observations were received from the Respondent.\n\n31.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, following a request from the Respondent agreed upon by the Claimant, the Tribunal amended the Procedural Calendar (\"Revision No. 3\").\n\n32.\n\nOn 8 April 2016, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction,5 accompanied by exhibits R-001 to R-117; legal authorities RL-001 to RL-131; and one (1) expert report by Mr. Carlos Ubico.\n\nOn 9 May 2016, with the Claimant's agreement, the Respondent submitted a Revised Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n33.\n\nFollowing a prior exchange of requests for document production among the Parties, on 20 May 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal its objections to the Claimant's requests for document production. On that same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the Respondent's single request for document production.\n\n34.\n\nOn 27 May 2016, the Claimant submitted its replies to the Respondent's objections on document production, together with exhibits C-352 to C-354.\n\n35.\n\nOn 10 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on document production.\n\n36.\n\nOn 7 July 2016, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied by exhibits C-351 to C-423; legal authorities CL-101 to CL-211;6 one (1) witness statement by Mr. Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez; and three (3) expert reports by Ms. Ana Virginia Calzada, Mr. Rub\u00e9n Hern\u00e1ndez together with Mr. Erasmo Rojas, and FTI Consulting Inc., respectively.\n\nThe same documents designated as exhibits C-351 to C-354 and legal authorities CL-101 to CL-109 had been previously submitted. *See infra*, \u00b6 45 and *supra*, \u00b6 34.\n\n37.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, following a request from the Respondent agreed upon by the Claimant, the Tribunal once more amended the Procedural Calendar (\"Revision No. 4\").\n\n38.\n\nOn 30 September 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on a short extension for the submission of its Reply on Jurisdiction and Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, which was due that day.\n\n39.\n\nOn 1 October 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, accompanied by exhibits R-118 to R-145; legal authorities RL-140 to RL-181; and one (1) expert report by Mr. Carlos Ubico.\n\n40.\n\nOn 16 December 2016, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, accompanied by exhibits C-075 (revised), C-424 to C-444; legal authorities CL-212 to CL-238; one (1) witness statement, by Mr. Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez; and two (2) expert reports by Ms. Ana Virginia Calzada, and Mr. Rub\u00e9n Hern\u00e1ndez together with Mr. Erasmo Rojas, respectively.\n\n**D. Non-Disputing Party Application and Submission**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nOn 15 September 2014, prior to the constitution of the Tribunal, the *Asociaci\u00f3n Preservacionista de Flora y Fauna Silvestre* (\"APREFLOFAS\") filed a \"Petition for Amicus Curiae Status,\" together with exhibit P-1 (\"APREFLOFAS's Petition\").\n\n42.\n\nOn 20 February 2015, the Tribunal informed APREFLOFAS that (i) it had received APREFLOFAS's Petition upon constitution; (ii) pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), it had invited the Parties to provide observations; and (iii) as a result of the Procedural Calendar set forth for such observations, a ruling on the Petition should not be expected until November 2015.\n\n43.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, APREFLOFAS filed a request for the Tribunal to rule on its Petition of 15 September 2014.\n\n44.\n\nOn 4 December 2015, the Tribunal informed APREFLOFAS that as a result of modifications to the Procedural Calendar, the Parties' observations on APREFLOFAS's Petition had been delayed until April 2016. In consequence, the Tribunal now expected to issue its ruling on APREFLOFAS's Petition in May 2016.\n\n45.\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Respondent filed a Submission on APREFLOFAS's Petition, together with legal authorities RL-132 to RL-139. On that same date, the Claimant filed its Submission on APREFLOFAS's Petition, together with exhibit C-351, and legal authorities CL-101 to CL-109.\n\n46.\n\nOn 1 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on APREFLOFAS's Petition. The Tribunal authorized APREFLOFAS to file a written submission, and granted it access to selected portions of the Parties' pleadings, subject to confidentiality restrictions. On 7 June 2016, both Parties consented to the publication of Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n47.\n\nOn 8 June 2016, APREFLOFAS received the pleading excerpts authorized by the Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nOn 19 July 2016, APREFLOFAS filed its Non-Disputing Party Submission, together with exhibits NDP-001 to NDP-013 (\"APREFLOFAS's Submission\" or the \"NonDisputing Party Submission\").\n\n49.\n\nOn 18 August 2016, following a request from the Tribunal, APREFLOFAS submitted translations of certain exhibits filed with its Non-Disputing Party Submission. Those translations were designated as exhibits NDP-014 to NDP-020.\n\n50.\n\nThe Parties presented their Observations on APREFLOFAS's Submission together with their respective Reply and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.7\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\n**E.

(\"Industrias Infinito\").\n\n69.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2000, Industrias Infinito allegedly performed drilling and studies to prove the existence and extent of the gold deposit. In particular:\n\na. In 1996, Industrias Infinito completed an extensive pre-feasibility study,14 which was accompanied by several reports and reviews on the viability of the project.15\n\nb. Industrias Infinito also commissioned other studies and reports addressing the environmental and socio-economic impact of the project.16\n\nc. In 1999, Industrias Infinito completed a comprehensive feasibility study that allegedly proved the existence of a substantial gold deposit in the Las Crucitas area.17 According to the Claimant, under the Mining Code this gave Industrias Infinito the exclusive right to obtain an exploitation concession.18\n\nd. In December 1999, Industrias Infinito submitted the feasibility study to the Directorate of Geology and Mines (\"DGM\"), a subdivision of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy (\"MINAE\"), and requested an exploitation concession to develop a surface gold mine at Las Crucitas.19\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Exh. **C-0040**, Placer Dome Explorations, Cerro Crucitas Project, Pre-Feasibility Study (December 1996).\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6 34; Exh. **C-0026,** Placer Dome de Costa Rica, Report on Black Sewage (Septic Tank) Treatment System Operation and Maintenance (September 1995); Exh. **C-0027**, Placer Dome Inc., Preliminary Metallurgical Evaluation (September 1995); Exh. **C-0032**, Placer Dome Inc., Gravity Concentration/Cyanide Leaching and Gravity Centration/Flotation Tests on Three Rock Type Composites (July 1996); Exh. **C-0033**, Hay & Company Consultants Inc., Sediment Reconnaissance Survey: Cerro Crucitas Project (August 1996); Exh. **C-0041**, Placer Dome de Costa Rica, Phase 1 Assessment of Potential for Acid Rock Drainage at the Cerro Crucitas Project, Costa Rica (December 5, 1996); Exh. **C-0043**, Bruce Geotechnical Consultants Inc., Cerro Crucitas-Tailing Dam Assessment Area B Tailing and Waste Rock Materials Balance (28 August 1997).\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37; Exh. **C-0047**, Annex 4 to Exploration Permit No. 7339: Socio Economic Study; Exh. **C-0025**, ICAPD Socio-Economic Impact Study (July 1995); Exh. **C-0030**, ICAPD Social Impact Study (December 1995).\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6 38; Exh. **C-0052**, Placer Dome, Feasibility Study (Executive Summary) (September 1999).\n\nC-Mem.

Measures that Affected the Las Crucitas Project**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nOn 13 February 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco, at the time a presidential candidate, filed a challenge before the MINAE, requesting the revocation of Industrias Infinito's 2002 Concession, alleging that it was against the national interest and endangered the constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment.30 Due to similar challenges before the Supreme Court, the MINAE deferred its decision on this challenge.\n\nExh. **R-0001**, Request for Review, Abel Pacheco de la Espriella (13 February 2002).\n\n76.\n\nOn 1 April 2002, environmental activists Carlos and Diana Murillo filed an *amparo* petition (constitutional challenge) against the resolution that granted Industrias Infinito's 2002 Concession on environmental grounds (the \"Murillo Amparo\").\n\n77.\n\nOn 8 May 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco took office as President of Costa Rica. On 5 June 2002, President Pacheco declared an indefinite moratorium on open-pit mining (the \"2002 Moratorium\").31 It is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium operated prospectively, and did not affect acquired (vested) rights.32\n\nExh. **C-0080**, Executive Decree No. 30477-MINAE (5 June 2002).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 63; Exh. **C-0080**, Executive Decree No. 30477-MINAE (5 June 2002).\n\n78.\n\nOn 12 August 2002, R\u00edo Minerales S.A. filed an *amparo* petition against the 2002 Moratorium, arguing that it violated the principles of legality, judicial certainty and nonretroactivity, as well as its vested rights. On 20 August 2002, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the 2002 Moratorium did not violate the petitioner's rights and was not retroactive in light of its grandfathering provision.33\n\nExh. **C-0085**, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (20 August 2002).\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that this decision confirmed that Industrias Infinito's rights (in particular, the 2002 Concession) were not affected by the 2002 Moratorium.34 Despite this, the SETENA had not yet ruled on Industrias Infinito's EIA, which had been requested in March 2002. For this reason, on 10 March 2003, Industrias Infinito filed an *amparo* petition requesting the Constitutional Chamber to compel the SETENA to issue its decision on Industrias Infinito's EIA.35\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 64.\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 119; Exh. **R-0006**, Request for Amparo, Industrias Infinito S.A. (10 March 2003).\n\n80.\n\nThe next day, on 11 March 2003, the SETENA denied approval of the EIA, on the grounds that it required a declaration by the Executive that the project was in the national interest, which was lacking, and that the request showed certain technical deficiencies.36 However, it did not disclose the reports which had served as the basis for its conclusions. As a result, on that same day Industrias Infinito appealed this decision before the MINAE.37 The MINAE agreed with Industrias Infinito, and on 20 October 2003 ordered the SETENA to conduct a new evaluation of Industrias Infinito's application.38\n\nExh. **C-0097**, Resolution No. 272-2003-SETENA (11 March 2003).\n\nR-Mem.

Jur., \u00b6 60; Exh. **C-0106**, Resolution No. 569-2003-MINAE (20 October 2003).\n\n81.\n\nIndustrias Infinito also filed on 21 April 2003 a second *amparo* petition with the Constitutional Chamber against the SETENA for violation of due process, requesting disclosure of the reports.39 The Constitutional Chamber ultimately agreed with Industrias Infinito and, on 25 August 2004, it compelled the SETENA to provide copies of any internal and external assessments of the EIA.40\n\nExh. **R-0008**, Second Amparo Proceeding (21 April 2003).\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 124; Exh. **C-0113,** Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (25 August 2004).\n\n82.\n\nIn the meantime, on 4 April 2003, the Claimant filed its first Notice of Dispute with the Ministry of Commerce.41\n\nExh. **R-0007**, Letter from MINAE to SETENA, DM-684-03, PREIA 002-03 (4 April 2003) and Letter from Vannessa Ventures Ltd. to Ministry of Commerce (4 April 2003).\n\n83.\n\nOn 26 November 2004, the Constitutional Chamber granted the Murillo Amparo. Specifically, it held that Industrias Infinito's 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment, because that concession was granted prior to the approval of the EIA. It thus annulled the 2002 Concession, \"*todo sin perjuicio de lo que determine el estudio de impacto ambiental,*\"42 which the Respondent translates as \"without prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment **may determine**,\"43 while the Claimant translates as \"without prejudice to the findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment.\"44\n\nExh. **C-0116**, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 62 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 67.\n\n84.\n\nOn 3 June 2005, the Claimant filed its first Request for Arbitration (\"2005 RFA\").\n\n85.\n\nOn 12 December 2005, the SETENA approved Industrias Infinito's EIA.45\n\nExh. **C-0134**, Resolution No. 3638-2005-SETENA (12 December 2005).\n\n86.\n\nIn May 2006, President \u00d3scar Arias took office.\n\n87.\n\nOn 4 December 2006, Industrias Infinito filed a request for clarification concerning the decision of 26 November 2004, asking the Constitutional Chamber to confirm that the annulment of the 2002 Concession had been \"relative\" as opposed to \"absolute\" and therefore subject to cure (*saneamiento*).46\n\nRER-Ubico 1, \u00b6 76.\n\n88.\n\nOn 7 June 2007, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court concluded that the requested clarification was a matter of administrative law and that it had no jurisdiction to opine on it, but clarified that the only prerequisite for granting the concession was the approval of the EIA.47\n\nExh. **c-0164**, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision No. 2007-7973 (7 June 2007).\n\n89.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the MINAE granted Mr. Pacheco's 2002 challenge against Industrias Infinito's 2002 Concession, on the basis of the Constitutional Chambers' 2004 finding that the 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution.48\n\nExh. **R-0079**, Resolution No. R-613-2007-MINAE (31 October 2007). The Claimant has submitted a different (unsigned and unstamped) version of this resolution, which purportedly rejects Mr. Pacheco's challenge (Exh. **c-0167**). After the Respondent contested the authenticity of Exh. **c-0167** (R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 68), the Claimant's witness Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez explained that this was a digital version that he had obtained from the MINAE and that he was unaware that it might not have been the final version (CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 2, \u00b6\u00b6 3-9). Thereafter, the Claimant appears to accept that the official version of the resolution is the one provided by the Respondent, *i.e*., Exh. **R-0079** (*see, e.g.*, C-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 61 and n. 140). The Tribunal thus understands that the Parties agree that the correct version of this document is Exh. **R-0079**.\n\n90.\n\nOn 1 January 2008, the new Code of Contentious Administrative Procedure (which created the Contentious Administrative Tribunal (\"TCA\")) entered into force.49\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 189.\n\n91.\n\nOn 4 February 2008, the SETENA approved a revised EIA.50\n\nExh. **c-0170**, Resolution No. 170-2008-SETENA (4 February 2008).\n\n92.\n\nOn 18 March 2008, President Arias issued a decree repealing the 2002 Moratorium, which entered into force on 4 June 2008.51\n\nExh. **c-0172**, Decree No. 34492-MINAE (18 March 2008).\n\n93.\n\nOn 21 April 2008, President Arias and the MINAE granted Industrias Infinito an exploitation concession (the \"2008 Concession\", also referred to simply as the \"Concession\"), using the administrative law concept of \"conversion\" (*i.e*., the previous annulled concession is converted into a valid one). The Parties agree that the applicable concept is conversion, but dispute its legal effect.52\n\nExh. **c-0176**, Resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE (21 April 2008).\n\n94.\n\nOn 13 October 2008, President Arias designated the Las Crucitas Project as one of national interest.53\n\nExh. **c-0196**, Executive Decree No. 34801-MINAET (13 October 2008).\n\n95.\n\nOn 17 October 2008, the National System of Areas Conservation (\"SINAC\") authorized the logging of trees on the land of the Las Crucitas Project.54 Industrias Infinito commenced logging the same day.55\n\nExh. **c-0197**, Resolution No. 244-2008 SCH (17 October 2008).\n\nR-Mem.

The SETENA resolution declaring the environmental viability of the project.\n\nb. The SETENA resolution approving the modification of the Las Crucitas Project.\n\nc.

The decision did not refer to the impact of the 2002 Moratorium.61\n\nExh. **C-0225**, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010).\n\n101.\n\nAlso on 16 April 2010, the TCA issued its own temporary injunction preventing the Las Crucitas Project from moving forward.62\n\nR-Mem.

On that same day, President Chinchilla issued a decree which expanded the Arias Moratorium Decree (the \"Chinchilla Moratorium Decree\" and, together with the Arias Moratorium Decree, the \"2010 Moratorium\" or \"2010 Executive Moratorium\"). In addition to prohibiting open-pit gold mining, it prohibited all mining activities using cyanide and mercury in the processing of ore.64 The Chinchilla Moratorium Decree entered into force on 11 May 2010.\n\nExh. **c-0229,** Executive Decree No. 36019-MINAE (8 May 2010).\n\n104.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, President Chinchilla issued a letter acknowledging the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision and the possibility of Government liability if the 2008 Concession was cancelled.65\n\nExh. **c-0233**, Letter by President Chinchilla (27 July 2010).\n\n105.\n\nMeanwhile, on 11 June 2010, environmental activists Carlos and Douglas Murillo filed an *amparo* petition with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court on the basis that Industrias Infinito's Concession was in breach of the 2002 Moratorium.66 The Constitutional Chamber rejected this petition on 24 August 2010, on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction to review the legality of the exploitation concession (including its conversion) and that of the related administrative acts.67\n\nRER-Ubico 1 \u00b6 84 citing Exh. **R-0028**, Resolution No. 2010-014009, Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (24 August 2010), \u00b6 1.\n\nExh. **R-0028**, Resolution No. 2010-014009, Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (24 August 2010).\n\n106.\n\nOn 24 November 2010, the TCA issued an oral summary of its decision on the annulment request filed by Mr. Lobos and APREFLOFAS, declaring that all requests for annulment had been granted (the \"2010 TCA Decision\").68 The TCA issued its full written decision on 14 December 2010,69 where, *inter alia*, it dismissed the *res judicata* defense raised by Industrias Infinito and the Government,70 and annulled Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession together with related administrative decisions.71\n\n(i) Resolution No. 3638-2005-SETENA, through which the SETENA declared the environmental viability for the extraction phase of the Las Crucitas Project for a period of 2 years, under specific terms and conditions;\n\n(ii) Resolution No. 170-2008-SETENA, through which the SETENA approved the amendment of the Las Crucitas Project;\n\nRER-Ubico 1 \u00b6 89 citing Exh. **R-0082**, Contentious-Administrative Procedural Code, Law No. 8508 (28 April 2006) (\"CPCA\"), Art. 111(1).\n\nExh. **c-0239**, Contentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010).

While the Respondent alleges that it was 10 February 2011 (R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 141), the Claimant states that it was 11 February 2011 (C-CM Jur., \u00b6 128, citing CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 201). In the Tribunal's view, the record suggests that the correct date is 10 February 2011:   \nthe amendment to the Mining Code (Exh. **C-0238**) states that it becomes effective on the date of its publication, and the date of publication appears to have been 10 February 2011. In any event, this discrepancy has no impact on the Parties' arguments.\n\n111.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to declare that the 2010 TCA Decision was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Constitutional Chamber's earlier decisions, in particular the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision.79\n\nRER-Ubico 1, \u00b6 112; Exh. **C-0259**, Action by Industrias Infinito to the Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber) (11 November 2011).\n\n112.\n\nOn 30 November 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court denied Industrias Infinito's cassation request, and upheld the main conclusions of the 2010 TCA Decision (the \"2011 Administrative Chamber Decision\").80\n\nExh. **C-0261**, Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011).\n\n113.\n\nOn 9 January 2012, the MINAE canceled Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession (the \"2012 MINAE Resolution\").81 According to Infinito, it also declared the Las Crucitas area to be free of all mining rights.82 Costa Rica disputes this last fact.83\n\nExh. **C-0268**, Resolution No. 0037, MINAE, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 124 citing CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 230.\n\nR-Mem.

ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Scope of this Decision**\n-----------------------------\n\n117.\n\nAs agreed by the Parties prior to the First Session and reflected in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1, these proceedings have been bifurcated between jurisdiction and merits. This Decision addresses the Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n**2. The Law Applicable to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention and the BIT. The relevant provisions are quoted in Sections IV.B and IV.C *infra*.\n\n119.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is governed by the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (\"VCLT\").\n\n120.\n\nIt is also undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.\n\n**3. Relevance of APREFLOFAS's Non-Disputing Party Submission**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nBefore addressing the Parties' positions on jurisdiction, the Tribunal will address the comments on jurisdiction made by the *Asociaci\u00f3n Preservacionista de Flora y Fauna Silvestre* (\"APREFLOFAS\") in its Non-Disputing Party Submission.\n\n**a. APREFLOFAs's submission**\n------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nAPREFLOFAS, who was one of the plaintiffs in the proceedings that culminated with the 2010 TCA Decision, asserts that Industrias Infinito's Concession \"was always illegal under the law of Costa Rica (as it applies to any party, foreign or not)\" and \"granted through an evident and intentional disregard of the applicable laws, and, as alleged by Prosecutors in cases before the Costa Rica Courts, likely through corruption and graft.\"86\n\nAPREFLOFAS Non-Disputing Party Written Submission dated 19 July 2016 (\"NDP Submission\"), \u00b6 2.\n\n123.\n\nIn compliance with the Tribunal's directions in Procedural Order No. 2, APREFLOFAS has limited its submission to factual and legal material not mentioned by the Parties. Specifically, it submits that (i) \"the Concession was illegal under the laws of Costa Rica,\" and (ii) \"Costa Rica courts have found that the events that led to the grant of the Concession were so egregious as to be likely criminal,\" leading to the prosecution of various public officers involved in the granting of the Concession.87 In APREFLOFAS's view, \"[b]oth arguments should [...] lead this Tribunal to rule that it does not have jurisdiction over Infinito's claims under the rules of the ICSID, the BIT and the prevailing view from several previous decisions by international investment law tribunals.\"88\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 3\n\n124.\n\nMore specifically, APREFLOFAS alleges that the approval of Industrias Infinito's Concession \"would have been impossible unless Infinito and the government officials described the Concession in a fraudulent manner\" and that \"[b]oth Infinito Gold and Government [o]fficials misrepresented the nature and scope of the Concession by failing even to consider the real environmental consequences of the Concession, illegally transforming a public road into a part of the private Concession and by the invalid conversion of an already annulled administrative act.\"89 According to APREFLOFAS, this arises from the 2010 TCA Decision,90 the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision,91 a Prosecutor Office's indictment,92 a trial order from a criminal judge,93 and a (now annulled) criminal decision acquitting several defendants and confirming the conviction of former Minister Roberto Dobles.94 In particular, APREFLOFAS alleges that the TCA found that \"the decision to grant the permits was part of a knowing and intentional conspiracy between public servants to disregard the laws of Costa Rica,\" and, as a result, prosecutions and/or sanctions have been brought against several officials who were responsible for the grant of the Concession, including former President Arias and former Minister of the Environment Roberto Dobles.95 According to APREFLOFAS, this shows that \"the Costa Rican courts not only found that the grant of the Concession and the subsequent 'conversion' were illegal under Costa Rican Law, but also that there was sufficient evidence to suggest the occurrence of criminal conduct under the Costa Rican Criminal Code, such as malfeasance in office or official misconduct.\"96\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nExh. **C-0239**, Contentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010).\n\nExh. **C-0261**, Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011).\n\nExh. **C-0278**, Accusation and Request to Open a Trial, Criminal Court of the Treasury, File No. 08-000012-033-PE (8 November 2012).\n\nExh. **NDP-001**, Trial Order of the Criminal Court for Treasury and Public Service, 2nd Judicial Circuit of San Jose, Case No. 08-000011-0033-PE (5 May 2013).\n\nExh. **NPD-002**, Judgment by the Criminal Trials' Tribunal, 2nd Judicial Circuit of San Jose, Case No. 08-000011-0033- PE, Decision No. 32-2015 (28 January 2015).\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n125.\n\nAPREFLOFAS notes in particular that, in addition to the criminal investigations initiated against the public officials involved, a criminal process for extortion (*concusi\u00f3n*) was initiated against former President \u00d3scar Arias due to an alleged donation made by Infinito to former President Arias's non-profit organization *Fundaci\u00f3n Arias Para La Paz*. However, this process was abandoned (*desestimado*) due to lack of sufficient evidence. APREFLOFAS points out however that, because the termination (*desestimaci\u00f3n*) was solely based on the lack of evidence, if new evidence is presented the case could be reopened.97\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 19; Exh. **NDP-012**, \"Good Riddance Infinito Gold, A Long Overdue Farewell to Costa Rica\", Mining Watch Canada (22 July 2015); Exh. **NDP-013**, \"*Fiscal\u00eda pide desestimar causa contra \u00d3scar Arias por Industrias Infinito; alega 'falta de pruebas* '\", CRHOY (3 October 2014).\n\n126.\n\nAPREFLOFAS further explains that the other criminal prosecutions proceeded to an indictment, and that after the relevant hearings all of the indicted persons (with the exception of former Minister Dobles) were acquitted, the court having found that there was no criminal action because the officials had acted within their discretionary powers.98 As to Minister Dobles, while he was acquitted for criminal action in the issuance of Resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE, he was found guilty of criminal malfeasance in office for issuing Executive Decree No. 34801-MINAET (the decree declaring that the Las Crucitas Project was in the national interest).99 However, the trial court's decision acquitting the public officials and convicting former Minister Dobles was ultimately annulled on appeal and remanded for a new hearing. As of the date of APREFLOFAS's Submission, no decision on the remanded case had been rendered.100\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 21; Exh. **NDP-002**, Judgment by the Criminal Trials' Tribunal, 2nd Judicial Circuit of San Jose, Case No. 08-000011-0033- PE, Decision No. 32-2015 (28 January 2015), pp. 187-197.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 21; Exh. **NDP-002**, Judgment by the Criminal Trials' Tribunal, 2nd Judicial Circuit of San Jose, Case No. 08-000011-0033- PE, Decision No. 32-2015 (28 January 2015), pp. 224-258.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\n127.\n\nAPREFLOFAS submits that the pending criminal proceedings and the facts upon which they are based have a significant bearing on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as they will determine whether there was corruption and violation of Costa Rica's criminal law.101 Relying on *Metal-Tech, Inceysa* and *Fraport I*, APREFLOFAS argues that investment tribunals lack jurisdiction if the claimant violated the host State's laws in the process of its investment activities.102 APREFLOFAS notes that Article I(g) of the BIT expressly defines investment as \"any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of other Contracting Party *in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws* [,..].\"103 Accordingly, for an investment to be considered as such, it needs to have been \"initiated and developed\" in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica.104 For APREFLOFAS, this is not the case here, because Industrias Infinito obtained an illegal concession through alleged criminal collaboration with a number of public officers. As a result, APREFLOFAS submits that this case is outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which is limited to the protection of legal investments controlled by the BIT.105\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 23.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, citing *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v.

The Respondent's comments on APREFLoFAs's submission**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that its factual presentation and legal arguments are fully supported by APREFLOFAS's Submission. It notes, in particular, that the APREFLOFAS's Submission recognizes that the Concession was annulled by the 2010 TCA Decision, and that the Administrative Chamber denied a cassation request against that decision after an extensive analysis of Industrias Infinito's allegations.106\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 332-333.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that APREFLOFAS's Submission supports its interpretations of domestic law and of the BIT relevant to its jurisdictional objections. In particular, it agrees that Infinito's claims amount to a mere disagreement with Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law, and that the BIT does not permit recourse to arbitration where a party has sought and failed to obtain a remedy in domestic courts.107\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 334-335.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that, while APREFLOFAS urges the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction to hear the case, its focus is different to the Respondent's, as it requests the Tribunal to base its decision on the illegal nature of Industrias Infinito's Concession as a matter of domestic and international law. The Respondent finds this difference in focus \"hardly surprising,\" given that the Tribunal had ordered APREFLOFAS to limit its submission to factual and legal material not put forward by the Parties.108 That said, the Respondent disagrees with the substance of APREFLOFAS's jurisdictional argument. Specifically, it states:\n\n[\u2026] Costa Rica does not believe that the evidence available to date is sufficient to sustain such a jurisdictional objection, *i.e*., that the entirety of Infinito's investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other malfeasance such that it fails to qualify as a *bona fide* investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. As the summary provided by APREFLOFAS shows, the numerous investigations of public officials for corruption and other crimes in relation to the granting of the 2008 Concession are either still ongoing or have resulted in dismissal of the charges.109\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 336.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 337.\n\n131.\n\nDespite this, the Respondent considers that the evidence provided by APREFLOFAS could be relevant for the Tribunal, especially if the case were to proceed to the merits, where the Tribunal would have to review in greater detail the nature of Infinito's rights and the manner in which they were obtained.110\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 338.\n\n**c. The claimant's comments on APREFLoFAs's submission**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimant contends that APREFLOFAS's allegations are factually and legally unfounded. First, it points out that neither Infinito nor any of its representatives, personnel or advisors, has ever been found liable for, or even charged with, intentional wrongdoing. The Claimant also denies having purposefully omitted or concealed information from the Costa Rican Government in connection with the Concession or the EIA.111\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 409-411.\n\n133.\n\nSecond, there have been no conclusive findings of wrongdoing against any Costa Rican officials in connection with actions related to the Las Crucitas Project. In any event, the only charges were for the technical misapplication of Costa Rican law (*delito de prevaricato*); and corruption has never been an issue. Not a single Costa Rican official has been convicted or charged with corruption. As to the charges for *prevaricato*, there have been no convictions of public officials. In particular, the conviction of former Minister Dobles was annulled due to a flawed procedure, and a new proceeding is pending.112\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 412-415; CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 3, \u00b6\u00b6 8-25.\n\n134.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant argues that Costa Rica cannot be shielded from the protections of the BIT by the wrongdoing of its own officials. Relying on *RDC, Fraport I* and *Kardassopoulos*, among others, the Claimant submits that \"[i]t is well-established that states cannot rely on their own wrong-doing to defeat jurisdiction.\"113 According to the Claimant \"[i]llegality only undermines BIT protections where the illegality is a result of intentional and serious wrongdoing by the investor, in deliberate evasion of domestic law,\" which is not the case here.114\n\nC-Rej.

Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n135.\n\nAPREFLOFAS argues that this Tribunal should decline jurisdiction because the Claimant's investment has not been made in accordance with Costa Rican law. Specifically, it argues that \"the Concession was illegal under the laws of Costa Rica,\" and \"Costa Rica courts have found that the events that led to the grant of the Concession were so egregious as to be likely criminal.\"115 In this context, it alleges that the public officials involved in the granting of the Concession intentionally violated the law, leading to criminal proceedings for malfeasance in office (*prevaricato*), although it recognizes that these proceedings are still pending. APREFLOFAS also alleges that the Concession was procured through extortion (*concusi\u00f3n*), noting that criminal proceedings were initiated against former President Arias, although it accepts that these proceedings were terminated for lack of evidence. On the basis of Article I(g) of the BIT, which contains a legality requirement, APREFLOFAS submits that the Claimant's investment is not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law, and as a result this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear Infinito's claims.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\n136.\n\nNotably, both the Claimant and the Respondent disagree with APREFLOFAS. The Claimant adamantly denies that its investment was established in violation of Costa Rican law, and in particular, it denies that there is any evidence of corruption or intentional serious wrongdoing on its part. The Respondent, for its part, expressly recognizes that the evidence available to date is insufficient to argue that \"the entirety of Infinito's investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other malfeasance such that it fails to qualify as a *bona fide* investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\"116\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 337.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted the Parties' positions. However, the legality requirement contained in the BIT impacts the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which the Tribunal has a duty to assess *ex officio*, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2). As a result, the Tribunal cannot merely rely on the Parties' assessment and must engage in its own inquiry on the basis of the evidence in the record. This is particularly true when there are allegations of corruption, which is a matter of international public policy.\n\n138.\n\nArticle I(g) of the BIT defines \"investment\" as \"any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws [\u2026].\"117 Hence, to be protected under the BIT, an investment must have been at the very least established in accordance with Costa Rican law (the provision could also be understood as requiring that the ownership and control must be exercised in accordance with Costa Rican law, a matter on which the Parties have not commented and that can remain open at this juncture).\n\nExh. **c-0001**, Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (18 March 1998) (\"Canada-Costa Rica BIT\"), Art. I(g).\n\n139.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, not every violation of domestic law will preclude the investment from benefitting from the substantive protections of the BIT. However, APREFLOFAS submits that the Concession was acquired through extortion or through intentional and/or non-trivial violations of Costa Rican law (malfeasance in office). At this stage and on the current record, the Tribunal cannot dismiss these allegations outright. While it has found no clear concrete evidence of malfeasance in office or extortion, the allegations are serious and the Tribunal cannot ignore that criminal proceedings have been initiated against public officials for these charges. It therefore defers this matter to the merits phase when further briefing and evidence may be submitted.\n\n140.\n\nEven in the absence of intentional wrongdoing, APREFLOFAS alleges that the Concession was obtained in violation of Costa Rican law, and the alleged violations do not appear to be trivial. Under Article I(g) of the BIT, to determine whether Infinito has made an investment that is protected under the BIT, the Tribunal must assess each of these allegations. However, whether the Concession was illegally granted is intertwined with the merits. Indeed, as this argument was raised by APREFLOFAS and not by the Parties, the latter have not addressed it in depth and will thus be given an opportunity to do so during the merits phase. The Tribunal thus finds it procedurally efficient to defer this matter to the merits phase.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nJurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25(1), which reads as follows:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n142.\n\nAccordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the following conditions must be met:\n\na. There must be a legal dispute.\n\nb. That dispute must arise directly out of an investment.\n\nc. The dispute must be between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State.\n\nd. The parties to the dispute must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre. Once given, this consent may not be withdrawn unilaterally.\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent does not challenge conditions (a) to (c). It is thus undisputed - and rightly so - that the present case concerns a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State [...].\" The Respondent's objections to jurisdiction all relate to its consent to arbitrate, required under condition (d) above and allegedly given in Article XII of the BIT.\n\n**C. Jurisdiction under the BIT**\n---------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nArticle XII of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n**ARTiCLE XII**\n\n**settlement of Disputes between an investor and the Host Contracting Party**\n\n1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.\n\n2. If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). The investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate:\n\n(a) that it is an investor as defined by Article I of this Agreement;\n\n(b) that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement; and\n\n(c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:\n\n(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;\n\n(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;\n\n(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage; and\n\n(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.\n\n4. The dispute may be submitted to arbitration under:\n\n(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington D.C. on 18 March, 1965 ('ICSID Convention'), if both the disputing Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the investor are parties to the ICSID Convention;\n\nor\n\n(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, if either the disputing Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the investor, but not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention; or\n\n(c) an ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in case neither Contracting Party is a member of ICSID, or if ICSID declines jurisdiction.\n\n5. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n6. (a) The consent given under paragraph (5), together with either the consent given under paragraph (3), or any relevant provision of Annex II, shall satisfy the requirements for:\n\n(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of Chapter II (Jurisdiction of the Centre) of the ICSID Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n\n(ii) an 'agreement in writing' for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention for the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 ('New York Convention').\n\n(b) Any arbitration under this Article shall be held in a State that is a party to the New York Convention, and claims submitted to arbitration shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for the purposes of Article I of that Convention.\n\n7. A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of international law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the extent that the domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or the principles of international law.\n\n8. An investor of one Contracting Party may seek interim injunctive relief, not involving the payment of damages, before the judicial or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, according to the latter's domestic legislation, prior to the institution of the arbitral proceeding.\n\n9. A tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:\n\n(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest;\n\n(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the disputing Contracting Party may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.\n\nA tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n10. An award of arbitration shall be final and binding and shall be enforceable in the territory of each of the Contracting Parties.\n\n11. Any proceedings under this Article are without prejudice to the rights of the Contracting Parties under Articles [ *sic* ] XIII. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, however, it is agreed that neither Contracting Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim in respect of specific loss or damage suffered by an investor of that Contracting Party, where such loss or damage is, or has been, the subject matter of arbitration under this Article, unless the other Contracting Party fails to comply with the award rendered in such arbitration.\n\n**1. Overview of the Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**a. overview of the Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction relate to the scope of Costa Rica's consent to arbitration under the BIT.118\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 8.\n\n146.\n\nAs a general matter, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's case is \"simply a rehash of arguments already considered - and unambiguously rejected - by *multiple* levels of Costa Rica's judicial system.\"119 The Claimant's entire case rests on a single premise: the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision. While the Claimant purports to be challenging subsequent acts by other Costa Rican judicial, executive and administrative organs, it is apparent from its submissions that its central claim is about the loss of the 2008 Concession, which was annulled by the 2010 TCA Decision. Because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim based on the 2010 TCA Decision, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's case. Specifically, the Respondent puts forward the following reasons:\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 5 (emphasis in original).\n\n147.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the claims are barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT, which excludes claims if a \"judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement\":120\n\na. While the Claimant purports to challenge other acts by the Costa Rican judicial, executive and administrative organs, its complaint is directed to the effects of the 2010 TCA Decision, and as such this is the act that should be deemed to be the relevant \"measure\" in this case. As in 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court has already rendered a decision on the 2010 TCA Decision, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claims.\n\nb. Even if one were to consider that the relevant measure is the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (which the Respondent denies), the latter submits that \"there exist multiple judgments of Costa Rican courts related to that measure within the meaning of BIT Article XII(3)(d),\" in particular because \"the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment is *itself* a judgment of a Costa Rican court and is inextricably related to another judgment of a Costa Rican court, *i.e.* the 2010 TCA Judgment.\"121 As a result, \"Article XII(3)(d) must [\u2026] be understood to preclude any challenge either to the 2010 TCA Judgment *or* to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment, especially given that the challenge is ultimately based on a disagreement with the legal conclusions reached by the Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law.\"122\n\nc. Likewise, all of the other measures of which the Claimant complains \"(a) are nothing more than vehicles for Claimant's indirect challenge to the 2010 TCA Judgment, and (b) constitute acts regarding which the Costa Rican judiciary has already rendered judgment, and are therefore beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction pursuant to Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.\"123\n\nExh. **C-0001**, Canada-Costa Rica BIT, Art. XII(3)(d); R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 10(d) (emphasis in original).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 10(d) (emphasis in original).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 11.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges however that the Claimant seeks to challenge the following measures:124\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which upheld the 2010 TCA Decision.\n\nb. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which denied a separate challenge on constitutional grounds against the 2010 TCA Decision.\n\nc. The 2012 MINAE Resolution, which executed the 2010 TCA Decision's order to cancel the 2008 Concession and remove it from the Mining Registry.\n\nd. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium consolidating the open-pit mining ban implemented in 2010 through the 2010 Executive Moratorium, which the Claimant alleges deprived it of the right to seek a new concession after its existing concession was annulled by the 2010 TCA Decision.125\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 4. The Respondent also included in this list the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, which quantified the liability for environmental remediation imposed by the 2010 TCA Decision, but the Claimant has withdrawn its challenge against this decision. C-CM Jur., \u00b6 44; R-Reply Jur., \u00b6 11.\n\nInitially the Respondent appears to consider that the Claimant is also challenging the 2010 Executive Moratorium issued by presidential decrees in 2010 (R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 4), but in later submissions it appears to acknowledge that the Claimant is challenging only the 2011 Legislative Moratorium. R-Reply Jur., \u00b6 9(d).\n\n149.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to consider Infinito's claims because \"they amount to no more than assertions that Costa Rica's judicial authorities incorrectly applied Costa Rican law.\"126 Further, \"[t]his Tribunal is not a court of appeals on matters of domestic law; it may only consider claims that arise under *international* law, and more particularly under the Canada-Costa Rica BIT.\"127 The Claimant's disagreement with the Costa Rican courts' decisions on matters of domestic law \"cannot serve to magically transform [Infinito's] complaint from a purely domestic-law argument to a legitimate claim under international law (whether for 'expropriation,' breach of 'fair and equitable treatment,' 'denial of justice,' or anything else),\" because \"[a]ll of these standards require evidence of fundamental failures of justice that go well beyond mere disagreement with a court's reasoning.\"128 And while the Claimant does allege that it faced a fundamental failure by the Costa Rican judicial system to reconcile allegedly conflicting rulings, this alleged inconsistency was already raised before and addressed by the Costa Rican courts.129\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 12.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 12 (emphasis in original).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 15.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 13.\n\n150.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, *i.e*. that the claims are time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations contained in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT.130 According to the Respondent, \"much of Claimant's case depends on challenges to measures that predate 6 February 2011,\" which the Claimant accepts is the cutoff date for purposes of assessing the applicability of this provision (the dispute having been submitted to arbitration on 6 February 2014).131 More specifically:\n\na. The Respondent contends that \"the main pillars of Claimant's arguments about Costa Rican law were thoroughly rejected by the 2010 TCA Judgment, which was officially rendered on 14 December 2010, as well as by earlier decisions of the Constitutional Chamber that Claimant either ignores or plainly misrepresents.\"132 However, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to review the substantive correctness of any of these court decisions, and \"[i]t would also be improper for the Tribunal to find that later-occurring judicial or administrative acts that merely left in place or applied the 2010 TCA Judgment to constitute independently justiciable breaches of the BIT.\"133\n\nb. Nor can the Claimant escape the \"fatal implications of the statute of limitations\" for its claim related to the 2010 Moratorium: although Infinito focuses on the mining code amendment (or 2011 Legislative Moratorium) adopted in late 2010 and effective from 10 February 2011 (*i.e*., within the limitation period), it ignores the fact that the 2010 Moratorium was already in force as a result of two earlier presidential decrees.134\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 16-19. Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT provides: \"An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if: [\u2026] not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage[\u2026]\" Exh. **C-0001**, Canada-Costa Rica BIT, Art. XII(3)(c).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, referring to C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 18.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 18.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 19.\n\n151.\n\nFourth, the Respondent contends that even if the Claimant attempts to focus on actions taken after 6 February 2011, the claims are barred under Section III(1) of Annex I of the BIT. This is because the actions challenged by the Claimant merely maintain or enforce earlier measures that were designed to ensure that investment in the territory of Costa Rica is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns. Such actions are exempt from review by an international arbitral tribunal under Section III(1) of Annex I of the BIT, so long as the underlying \"measures\" are \"otherwise consistent\" with the BIT.135\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 20.\n\n152.\n\nFifth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to present a *prima facie* case that there has been a breach of the BIT's provisions on fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") (Article II(a)), full protection and security (Article II(b)), or expropriation (Article VIII):\n\na. With respect to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, under the relevant BIT provisions the Claimant must prove that the judicial acts challenged amount to a denial of justice, which it has failed to do. Nor could the Claimant have acquired any legitimate expectations from the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision that could later have been violated by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.136\n\nb. With respect to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, the Claimant appears to recognize that the rejection of its unconstitutionality complaint was based on valid procedural grounds. And while it complains of the time that it took to resolve the case, it does not claim prejudice or damage arising from the delay.137\n\nc. With respect to the 2012 MINAE Resolution, the Claimant \"fails to present an intelligible theory for how this Resolution went beyond the 2010 TCA Judgment, which expressly ordered MINAE to expunge the concession from the Mining Registry,\" nor has it shown that this decision cancelled any of the Claimant's additional rights.138\n\nd. Similarly, the 2015 TCA Damages Decision simply implemented the 2010 TCA Decision by imposing joint liability on the defendants for environmental remediation of the Las Crucitas site. The Claimant does not argue that this decision violated Costa Rican law or was inconsistent with the 2010 TCA Decision. Nor does it claim any damage arising from that decision.139\n\ne. As to the ban on open pit-mining, the Claimant has not alleged that the 2011 Legislative Moratorium or the executive decrees that preceded it were illegal or improperly implemented as a matter of Costa Rican law. In addition, while these decrees precluded the granting of new mining rights, the Claimant has not explained how they could have infringed on any right already held by Infinito (indeed, the Costa Rican courts had found that these decrees did not violate the petitioners' acquired rights). Nor has the Claimant shown that it would have been entitled to obtain a new concession and all the necessary permits to develop the Las Crucitas Project in the absence of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium.140\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 25(a).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 25(b).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 25(c).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 25(d).\n\n153.\n\nSixth, the Respondent submits that none of the five \"measures\" expressly challenged by the Claimant were the cause of the damage that it asserts in this arbitration. As a result, they cannot give rise to a dispute within the meaning of the dispute settlement provisions in the BIT, which repeatedly refer to the investor's obligation to specify how it \"has incurred loss or damage\" as a result of the asserted breach. The Respondent notes in this regard that Infinito has asserted that its investment had lost its entire value by November 2011, prior to three of the measures of which it complains. As to the remaining two measures (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium), they could not have caused the damage alleged by the Claimant.141\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.\n\n154.\n\nSeventh, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to comply with the BIT's mandatory conditions on the submission of the dispute to arbitration with respect to the 2015 TCA Damages Decision (which had not even been issued when the Claimant submitted this dispute to arbitration). Such conditions include a prenotification of the dispute to Costa Rica at least six months prior to the initiation of the arbitration under Article XII(2) of the BIT, and express consent to arbitration and waiver of the right to domestic law remedies under Article XII(3) of the BIT no later than the submission of the Request for Arbitration. According to the Respondent, \"[t]his Tribunal's jurisdiction is to be assessed as of the time of submission of the Request to Arbitration, and does not extend to any and all disputes that might arise subsequent to that date[\u2026]\"142\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 29. Subsequently to this submission, and in light of the Claimant's withdrawal of the claim concerning the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the Respondent stated it was reducing its objections to jurisdiction to seven, thereby eliminating the objection directed specifically at the 2015 TCA Damages Decision claim. R-Reply Jur., \u00b6 11. During the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the Respondent explained, however, that \"it want[ed] to make sure that the Tribunal understands that the Claimant cannot claim to withdraw the measure or the claim, rather, and then, after the jurisdictional objections, assuming that we even get to the merits stage, that they will somehow revive that measure.\" Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 160:16-22 (Mr. Gran\u00e9).\n\n155.\n\nEighth, the Respondent submits that the \"Claimant cannot circumvent any of the jurisdictional flaws described above by selective importation of clauses from Costa Rica's investment treaties with third States through the Most Favored Nation (MFN) clause contained in Article IV of the BIT.\"143 According to the Respondent, \"[t]he MFN clause of the BIT does not provide a license to disregard treaty provisions that were specifically negotiated and ratified as a package deal by Canada and Costa Rica,\" in particular as Infinito has failed to identify any third party investor who has been accorded more favorable treatment in like circumstances.144 A majority of investment tribunals have found that MFN clauses cannot modify the terms of a BIT's dispute resolution clause, especially in cases involving MFN clauses with similar wording as the one at issue here, or where a claimant seeks to expand the scope of a State's consent to arbitration. The Respondent argues in this regard that most of the provisions it invokes to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal \"are not procedural pre-conditions to arbitration but rather provide clear substantive limits on the type of dispute Costa Rica has consented to arbitrate,\" and \"[t]he Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to go beyond the limits of such consent.\"145\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 30.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 30.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 30.\n\n**b. overview of the Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nAs a general matter, the Claimant argues that the Respondent impermissibly attempts to re-characterize Infinito's case, and that the Respondent's objections are directed to that reformulated case, not to the case that the Claimant has brought.146\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 1.\n\n157.\n\nThe Claimant recalls that in this arbitration it is challenging the following four measures:\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, \"thereby rendering final and irreversible the annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change permit.\"147\n\nb. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which Infinito alleges declined to resolve, on admissibility grounds, the conflict between its earlier decision upholding the constitutionality of the Las Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010 TCA Decision.148\n\nc. The 2012 MINAE Resolution, which Infinito alleges cancelled the 2008 Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito's mining rights from the mining registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.149\n\nd. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium on open-pit mining, which the Claimant alleges replaced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, prohibiting Industrias Infinito from applying for new permits.150\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(a); Exh. **C-0261**, Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(b); Exh. **C-0283**, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (19 June 2013).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(c); Exh. **C-0268**, Resolution No. 0037, MINAE, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012). Infinito also refers to this as the 2012 Directorate of Geology and Mines (DGM) Resolution.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(d); Exh. **C-0238**, Amendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010).\n\n158.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[i]t is the combined operation of these four measures [...] that meant that Industrias Infinito definitively could no longer pursue the development of the Crucitas project.\"151 More particularly, the Claimant submits that the composite result of these measures breached the BIT in four ways:\n\na. It expropriated the Claimant's investments by definitively precluding Infinito from building and operating the Crucitas gold mine.152\n\nb. It breached Costa Rica's obligation to provide FET to Infinito's investments, by violating its legitimate expectations and denying both procedural and substantive justice to Infinito.153\n\nc. It failed to grant Infinito's investments full protection and security.154\n\nd. It breached two substantive obligations imported into the BIT through the BIT's MFN clause from other bilateral investment treaties signed by Costa Rica: (i) Costa Rica's obligation to do \"what is necessary\" to protect Infinito's investments, imported from the Costa Rica-France bilateral investment treaty, and (ii) the \"umbrella clause\" requiring Costa Rica to \"comply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,\" found in Costa Rica's bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and Korea.155\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 12.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 13; C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 246-289.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 14; C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 290-344.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 15; C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 345-347.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 16; C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 348-360.\n\n159.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction must fail for the following reasons:\n\n160.\n\nFirst, there is no merit to the Respondent's argument that Infinito's case is \"really\" a challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision, and that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is excluded under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT because a Costa Rican court has rendered a judgment with respect to that measure. \"It is the investor's prerogative to allege and formulate its claims as it sees fit,\"156 and the Respondent cannot reformulate them. Here, the Claimant is challenging the four measures listed above, and in particular the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which is the measure that rendered Infinito's investments substantially worthless. Neither this decision, nor the other measures challenged by Infinito have been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican court.157 According to the Claimant, \"Costa Rica ignores the ordinary meaning, context and purpose of Article XII(3)(d),\" which \"encourages the pursuit (though does not require exhaustion) of local remedies while insulating lower domestic judicial decisions from being challenged under the BIT.\"158 In addition, the Respondent's interpretation would \"gut the investor protections in the BIT by allowing Costa Rica to shield its measures from challenge merely by ensuring that a judgment of a Costa Rican court was generated regarding that measure.\"159\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 20.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 19.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 20. *See also* C-CM Jur., \u00b6 160.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 22.\n\n161.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that the Respondent impermissibly attempts to reframe its claims so that they fall outside of the three-year limitation period set out in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. The Claimant reiterates that the focus must be on the claims as it has pleaded them, not as re-characterized by the Respondent. The Respondent also ignores the plain wording of the provision: Article XII(3)(c) bars a claim only if three years have elapsed from the time at which the Claimant first acquired (or should have first acquired) (i) knowledge of the alleged breach and (ii) knowledge that it has sustained loss or damage. The breaches of the BIT did not crystallize until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, at the earliest, because it was after this decision that Infinito's investments in Costa Rica became substantially worthless. As a result, the limitation period did not begin to run before November 2011 at the earliest, and accordingly Infinito's claims were brought on time.160\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\n162.\n\nThird, the Respondent distorts the meaning of Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT. This provision only applies to measures \"otherwise consistent\" with the BIT, *i.e*., measures that do not breach other substantive BIT protections. The Respondent's interpretation undermines the object and purpose of the BIT, which is investment protection.161 In addition, the provision only applies to measures sensitive to environmental concerns, and the Claimant contends that the measures it challenges were not motivated by *bona fide* environmental concerns. In particular, \"[t]he exploitation concession and other project approvals were annulled on the basis of the technical application of the 2002 moratorium to the project after the project was deemed environmentally sound by all competent authorities in Costa Rica and by the Constitutional Chamber,\" and that \"[t]he Costa Rican government and environmental authorities defended the project's environmental soundness before Costa Rican courts.\"162 As a result, Infinito argues that the Respondent cannot invoke Annex I, Section III(1).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 25.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 26 (emphasis in original).\n\n163.\n\nFourth, while purporting to require the Tribunal to assess whether Infinito has made a *prima facie* case on the merits, the Respondent is in fact asking the Tribunal to determine the merits of the dispute and thus to determine contentious issues of fact and law that are inappropriate at the jurisdictional stage. According to the Claimant, \"[a] *prima facie* analysis requires the Tribunal to accept the facts pleaded as true and assess whether they could support a claim for breach of the BIT.\"163 The Claimant asserts that it \"has demonstrated Costa Rica's breaches of the BIT on a balance of probabilities,\" and has thus \"more than met its burden to establish *prima facie* breaches of the BIT.\"164 Specifically:\n\na. With respect to the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT:\n\ni. The Claimant argues that no investment tribunal has ever dismissed a claim for breach of the FET standard because the claimant failed to show a *prima facie* case. This is because the determination of the standard is fact-specific and flexible, and must be assessed in the context of the facts and evidence, which are a matter for the merits.\n\nii. In any event, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the FET standard of the BIT is equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (\"MST\"), and argues that it would be premature for the Tribunal to determine this question during the jurisdictional phase.\n\niii. Whether the FET standard is autonomous or limited to the MST, the Claimant contends that it has \"demonstrated that its claims are *capable* of breaching the FET standard in Article II(2)(a),\" and therefore it has established a *prima facie* case that this provision was breached:165\n\n\u25a0 With respect to its legitimate expectations claim, the Claimant argues that the Government provided repeated assurances to Infinito, upon which Infinito reasonably relied for more than a decade in deciding to continue investing in the Las Crucitas Project.166 Specifically, \"Industrias Infinito was granted an exploration permit, an exploitation concession, and several other permits and approvals over the course of the project's life,\" and \"[a]t each step, it was encouraged and induced to continue investing in the project.\"167 The Claimant further alleges that \"[t]he legality of the Crucitas project's exploitation concession and approvals was confirmed in multiple judicial decisions including by the country's highest court.\"168 That after \"these repeated and far-reaching assurances\" \"the Administrative Chamber retroactively applied the 2002 moratorium, nine years after it was adopted, and after Infinito had spent millions developing and building the project in reliance on its mining rights and that the 2002 moratorium did not apply to its project,\" amounts to a breach of the Claimant's legitimate expectations, regardless of whether the standard is autonomous or limited to the MST.169\n\n\u25a0 Likewise, the Claimant submits that it has made a *prima facie* case of a procedural and substantive denial of justice. Procedurally, the Claimant contends that the Respondent denied justice to Infinito by failing to provide a legal system capable of protecting Infinito's investments, because it lacked a mechanism to resolve the inconsistency between the decisions of different chambers of the Supreme Court. Substantively, the Claimant argues that the Administrative Chamber denied justice to Infinito by incorrectly and retroactively applying the 2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession and other project approvals.170\n\nb. With respect to expropriation, the Claimant contends that it has demonstrated both on a balance of probabilities and on a *prima facie* basis that Costa Rica expropriated its investments both directly and indirectly.171 In particular, the Claimant advances the following arguments:\n\ni. The sole effects doctrine applies to judicial expropriations in the same manner as it does to other expropriatory measures.172\n\nii. Costa Rica cannot argue that the Administrative Chamber was applying the 2002 Moratorium as a defense. This amounts to arguing that Costa Rica legitimately exercised its police powers, but this defense is not available to Costa Rica because the application of the 2002 Moratorium was neither necessary nor proportionate to any legitimate objective and was in breach of the FET standard.173\n\niii. Compliance with domestic law is not a defense to expropriation, particularly where the domestic law in question (the 2002 Moratorium) post-dates the investment.174\n\niv. A court decision that applies domestic law may be expropriatory where the domestic law applied is itself expropriatory or breaches a rule of international law.175 Here, the Claimant alleges that, as applied by the Administrative Chamber, the 2002 Moratorium was in itself expropriatory.\n\nv. The Respondent's argument that a denial of justice is a prerequisite for a judicial measure to be expropriatory cannot succeed on a *prima facie* basis.\n\nvi. The Claimant has established beyond a *prima facie* standard that it had investments capable of being expropriated. The Respondent's argument that Infinito's rights were not capable of expropriation because they were deemed invalid by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment should be rejected: Infinito's investments extended beyond the 2008 Concession and other approvals annulled by the Administrative Chamber and were not capable of being \"invalidated\" by it. In addition, the validity of the Concession and other approvals must be assessed independently from the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, because this is the very measure that the Claimant alleges breached the BIT. In any event, \"Costa Rica is estopped from asserting that the 2002 moratorium rendered Industrias Infinito's rights invalid when its own Constitutional Chamber and authorities represented over the course of more than a decade that the moratorium did not apply to the project.\"176\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 28 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 28 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 34 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 32.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 32.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 32.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 32.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 33.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 35.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 35.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 35.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 36.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 36.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 37.\n\nc. Finally, the Claimant submits that it has established on a *prima facie* basis that Costa Rica failed to provide full protection and security to its investments in breach of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal need not (and should not) definitively determine the scope of this provision at the jurisdictional stage.177\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 38.\n\n164.\n\nFifth, the Claimant denies that its case is nothing more than an appeal from the decisions of Costa Rican courts. This argument inaccurately characterizes and fails to analyze the claims it has actually made.178\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 39.\n\n165.\n\nSixth, the Claimant asserts that, contrary to the Respondent's contention, it has demonstrated its damages case on a balance of probabilities and at the very least on a *prima facie* basis.179 Its losses crystallized on the date of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. In any event, it argues that \"Infinito's evidence must be accepted as true for the purpose of the jurisdictional analysis,\" and \"[t]he question of the precise date on which Infinito's losses crystallized must be left for the merits\" and is \"irrelevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"180 The Claimant also denies that it must prove separate losses for the other measures that it challenges: these measures prevented Industrias Infinito from obtaining a new exploitation concession and new project approvals, and thus operated in combination with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision to render Infinito's investments substantially worthless.181\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 40.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 41.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 42.\n\n166.\n\nSeventh, the Claimant submits that, through the BIT's MFN clause (Article IV), it is entitled to benefit from the more favorable drafting of the dispute settlement provisions found in the bilateral investment treaties signed by Costa Rica with Taiwan and Korea, from which the preconditions set out in Article XII(3) are absent. The Respondent's interpretation ignores the broad wording of Article IV of the BIT, which includes more favorable substantive and procedural protections under other bilateral investment treaties. Such interpretation also undermines the purpose of Article IV and the investment protection purpose of the BIT as a whole. In addition, Article XII(3) is an admissibility and not a jurisdictional provision, and as such does not define the Tribunal's jurisdiction, so the Respondent's concerns are inapplicable.182\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 43.\n\n167.\n\nFinally, although the Claimant withdraws its claim with respect to the 2015 TCA Damages Decision because it is not final and binding on Industrias Infinito,183 it reserves its right to challenge as an ancillary measure any future Administrative Chamber decision that breaches the BIT. The Claimant argues that \"[a]lthough the Tribunal need not determine the issue at this stage, no new notice or amicable settlement period would be required in respect of this claim because it arises from the same subject-matter as the measures already challenged by Infinito.\"184\n\n*See supra*, n. 124 and *infra*, n. 208.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 44.\n\n**2. Jurisdictional Requirements under Article XII**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether Article XII sets out only jurisdictional requirements, or also admissibility requirements. The Respondent submits that all of the requirements set out in Article XII are jurisdictional, because they establish the scope of Costa Rica's consent to arbitration.185 By contrast, the Claimant argues that the relevant jurisdictional requirements are found in Article XII(2), in conjunction with Costa Rica's unilateral consent to arbitrate provided under Article XII(5), while those in Article XII(3) are conditions for admissibility.186\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 282-288.\n\nC-CM. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 516-518.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that most (but not all) of the requirements in Article XII are jurisdictional, as they determine the conditions under which Costa Rica has consented to submit claims to arbitration. Jurisdictional requirements are obviously first found in Article XII(1) of the BIT, read together with Article XII(2), which provide as follows:\n\n1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.\n\n2. If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). The investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate:\n\n(a) that it is an investor as defined by Article I of this Agreement;\n\n(b) that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement; and\n\n(c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n170.\n\nFor the Tribunal, not all of the conditions set out in these provisions go to its jurisdiction. Only the following are jurisdictional requirements:\n\na. There must be a dispute (Article XII(1)). Read together with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, this dispute must be legal in nature.\n\nb. The dispute must be between one Contracting Party to the BIT and an investor of the other Contracting Party (Article XII(1)).\n\nc. The dispute must relate to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the host State is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)).\n\nd. The dispute must also relate to a claim \"that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\" (Article XII(1)).\n\ne. A period of six months must have elapsed from the date on which a notice of dispute has been delivered in accordance with the final paragraph of Article XII(2)), during which the Parties must have attempted to settle the dispute amicably, before the claim can be submitted to arbitration (Article XII(2)).187\n\nExh. **C-0001**, Canada-Costa Rica BIT, Art. XII(1)-XII(2).\n\n171.\n\nBy contrast, sub paragraphs (a) to (c) of Article XII(2) do not establish jurisdictional requirements; they set out rules on burden of proof. Indeed, the provision states that \"[t]he investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate: (a) that it is an investor as defined by Article I of this Agreement; (b) that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement; and (c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\" These rules on burden of proof will thus apply whenever the relevant requirement needs to be proven, be it at the jurisdictional or at the merits stage. With respect to (a), the investor must prove that it qualifies as an investor under the BIT during the jurisdictional phase, because the condition of investor is necessary to establish jurisdiction. By contrast, the conditions under (b) and (c) of Article XII(2) must be proven at the merits stage.\n\n172.\n\nOther requirements can be found in Article XII(3), which reads as follows:\n\n3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:\n\n(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;\n\n(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;\n\n(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage; and\n\n(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.\n\n173.\n\nArticle XII(3)(a) is clearly a jurisdictional requirement, as there can be no jurisdiction without a party's consent. Article XII(3)(b) is also jurisdictional in nature: the host State has not consented to arbitrate if the investor has not waived its right to initiate or continue other proceedings before the courts of the host State.\n\n174.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of Article XII(3) constitute jurisdictional requirements or go to admissibility. As explained in Section IV.C.4.c *infra*, in what pertains to Article XII(3)(c) the Tribunal defers this discussion to the merits phase, should it become relevant at that stage; and in what pertains to Article XII(3)(d), the Tribunal observes that the matter is of no consequence (Section IV.C.4.a(iii) *infra*).\n\n175.\n\nAccordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the following conditions must be met:\n\na. There must be a dispute (Article XII(1)). Read together with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, this dispute must be legal in nature. The Parties agree (and rightly so) that there is a legal dispute in this case.\n\nb. The dispute must be between one Contracting Party to the BIT and an investor of the other Contracting Party (Article XII(1)). Here, the dispute clearly involves one Contracting Party (Costa Rica). The notion of \"investor\", on the other hand, is defined in Article I(h) as:\n\n(i) any natural person possessing the citizenship of one Contracting Party who is not also a citizen of the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(ii) any enterprise as defined by paragraph (b) of this Article, incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of one Contracting Party;\n\nwho owns or controls an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party.188\n\nArticle I(b) defines \"enterprise\" as:\n\n(i) any entity constituted or organized under applicable law, whether or not for profit, whether privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture or other association; and\n\n(ii) a branch of any such entity;\n\nFor further certainty, 'business enterprise' means any enterprise which is constituted or organized in the expectation of economic benefit or other business purposes.\n\nIn turn, Article I(g) defines \"investment\" as:\n\n[\u2026] any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property and any related property rights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n\n(ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in an enterprise;\n\n(iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value;\n\n(iv) goodwill;\n\n(v) intellectual property rights;\n\n(vi) rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources;\n\nbut does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.\n\nFor further certainty, investment does not mean, claims to money that arise solely from:\n\n(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national or enterprise in the territory of one Contracting Party to a national or an enterprise in the territory of the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing, where the original maturity of the loan is less than three years.\n\nWithout prejudice to subparagraph (ii) immediately above, a loan to an enterprise where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor shall be considered an investment.\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, an investor shall be considered to control an investment if the investor has the power to name a majority of its directors or otherwise to legally direct the actions of the enterprise which owns the investment.\n\nAny change in the form of an investment does not affect its character as an investment.\n\nFor greater clarity, returns shall be considered a component of investment. For the purpose of this Agreement, \"returns\" means all amounts yielded by an investment, as defined above, covered by this Agreement and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties, fees or other current income.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant is an investor under this definition. Indeed, it is undisputed that Infinito is an enterprise duly constituted in accordance with the applicable laws of Canada, being incorporated in that country. Nor does the Respondent dispute that Infinito owns or controls an investment made in the territory of Costa Rica. The Claimant asserts that it owns or controls the following assets in the territory of Costa Rica: \"(i) its shares in Industrias Infinito; (ii) the money it invested in Industrias Infinito through intercompany loans; (iii) the exploitation concession; (iv) the pre-existing mining rights underlying the exploitation concession; (v) the other approvals for the Crucitas project; (vi) the physical assets associated with the project, including the half-built mining infrastructure; and (vii) the intangible assets associated with the project.\"189 The Respondent does not contest this. However, as noted in Section IV.A.3 *supra*, APREFLOFAS has argued that the Claimant's investment was not obtained in accordance with Costa Rican law, and therefore does not meet the definition of investment at Article I(g) of the BIT. As explained in that same Section, the Tribunal has deferred this matter to the merits.\n\nc. The dispute must relate to a claim by the Claimant that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)). Here, there is no dispute that the Claimant claims that measures taken by Costa Rica are in breach of the BIT, but the Parties dispute what those measures are and whether they qualify as \"measures\" for the purposes of the BIT. This dispute is at the heart of several of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction.\n\nd. The dispute must also relate to a claim \"that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\" (Article XII(1)). Again, the Claimant claims that it has incurred loss or damage arising out of the breaches it alleges, but the Respondent disputes that this damage could have arisen from the measures identified by the Claimant as being in breach of the BIT. This dispute is also central to one of the Respondent's objections.\n\ne. The Claimant must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to arbitration (Article XII(3)(a)). There is no dispute that Infinito and Industrias Infinito190 have both consented in writing to arbitrate this dispute by filing the Request for Arbitration and providing written consents to arbitration,191 with the exception of the objection directed to the claim regarding the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, a claim that the Claimant has in any event withdrawn, and an objection that the Respondent does not presently pursue, as discussed at paragraphs 154 and 167 and note 142 *supra*. It is noted in this context that the Respondent's consent is found at Article XII(5), which provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\"\n\nf. A period of six months must have elapsed from the date in which a notice of dispute has been delivered in accordance with the final paragraph of Article XII(2), during which the Parties must have attempted to settle the dispute amicably, before the claim can be submitted to arbitration (Article XII(2)). There is no dispute that this requirement has been met, with the same exception as the one noted in subparagraph (e) above.\n\ng. The Claimant must have waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation to the measures that are alleged to be in breach of the BIT before the Costa Rican courts or tribunals or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind (Article XII(3)(b)). There is no dispute that both Infinito and Industrias Infinito have provided the required waiver,192 with the exception of the objection directed to the claim regarding the 2015 TCA Damages Decision mentioned in subparagraph (e) above.\n\nThe Tribunal has omitted the additional definition regarding the term \"natural person possessing the citizenship of one Contracting Party\" for Canada, as the Claimant is not a natural person.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 219.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that Section II of Annex II of the BIT provides:\n\n\"II. Damage Incurred by a Controlled Enterprise  \n 1. A claim that a Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that an enterprise that is a juridical person incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of that Contracting Party has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, may be brought by an investor of the other Contracting Party acting on behalf of an enterprise which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly. In such a case:  \n (a) any award shall be made to the affected enterprise;  \n (b) the consent to arbitration of both the investor and the enterprise shall be required; [\u2026].\"\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 232; Exh. **C-0289**, Request for Arbitration (6 February 2014); Exh. **C-0002**, Consent to Arbitration and Waiver of Infinito (3 February 2014); Exh. **C-0003**, Resolution of the Board of Directors of Infinito Authorizing the Consent to Arbitration and Waiver and the Submission of the Request for Arbitration (4 February 2014); Exh. **C-0005**, Consent to Arbitration and Waiver of Industrias Infinito (3 February 2014).\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 232; Exh. **C-0289**, Request for Arbitration (6 February 2014); Exh. **C-0002**, Consent to Arbitration and Waiver of Infinito (3 February 2014); Exh. **C-0003**, Resolution of the Board of Directors of Infinito Authorizing the Consent to Arbitration and Waiver and the Submission of the Request for Arbitration (4 February 2014); Exh. **C-0005**, Consent to Arbitration and Waiver of Industrias Infinito (3 February 2014).\n\n176.\n\nIn addition, the following two requirements must also be met (whether as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility, a debate over which the Tribunal does not presently rule):\n\na. Not more than three years must have elapsed from the date on which Infinito first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage (Article XII(3)(c)). The Respondent disputes that this requirement is met.\n\nb. No judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of the BIT (Article XII(3)(d)). Compliance with this requirement is also disputed by the Respondent.\n\n177.\n\nThe disagreements noted at (c) and (d) of the preceding paragraph are at the heart of several of the Respondent's objections. Specifically:\n\na. Underlying virtually all of the Respondent's objections is the argument that the Claimant is formally challenging certain measures, when its case is \"really\" about other (previous) measures. The question thus arises whether, for jurisdictional purposes, the Tribunal must focus on the measures as pleaded or whether it can re-characterize them, including by determining whether the acts impugned qualify as \"measures\" for purposes of the BIT at all.\n\nb. The Respondent also submits that the claims amount to a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law, rather than a genuine claim under the BIT. While it does not expressly ground this objection on a particular provision of Article XII, the Tribunal understands that this is related to the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim by the Claimant that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)).\n\nc. The Respondent further argues that the Claimant fails to show a *prima facie* case of any of the alleged breaches of the BIT. This objection also appears to be grounded on the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)), as well as on Article XII(2)(b).\n\nd. In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to articulate how it suffered losses from the challenged measures. Again, this objection appears to be based on the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, the breaches alleged (Article XII(1)), and on Article XII(2)(c), according to which the Claimant bears the burden of proving that it has \"incurred loss or damage.\"\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal will address these issues first, in order to establish whether the main jurisdictional requirements are met (Section IV.C.3 *infra*).\n\n**3. The Respondent's Objections Arising from Article XII(1) and (2)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Should the Tribunal Consider the Case as Pleaded by the Claimant?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nAt the heart of the Respondent's objections is the same underlying argument: \"the key measure underlying Infinito's claims is the annulment of Infinito's concession by the 2010 TCA Judgment.\"193 For the Respondent, this is the measure that annulled the 2008 Concession and other project approvals, an annulment that the Claimant has recognized \"instantly,\" rendered its investments \"substantially worthless,\" and breached the BIT.194 In other words, the Claimant's case is \"really\" about the 2010 TCA Decision, and not about the measures formally challenged by the Claimant.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 156.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 155, referring to C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 269 and 291.\n\n180.\n\nRelying on the expert report of Carlos Ubico, the Respondent asserts that, as a matter of Costa Rican law, it was the 2010 TCA Decision which ordered the annulment of the Concession and other approvals, and that it was not in any way provisional or dependent on any confirmation by the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.195 Although Industrias Infinito's cassation request before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the execution of the 2010 TCA Decision, the decision itself remained valid and binding unless reversed by the Administrative Chamber.196 This cassation request did not \"undo\" the annulment, so that the Administrative Chamber could once more annul it; rather, it merely constituted pursuit and exhaustion by the Claimant of its local remedies. Citing James Crawford, the Respondent argues that \"the breach of international law occurs at the time when the treatment occurs\" and \"[t]he breach is not postponed to a later date when local remedies are exhausted [\u2026].\"197 As stated by the PCIJ in the *Phosphates* case, a refusal to redress a prior wrong \"merely results in allowing the [allegedly] unlawful act to subsist. It exercises no influence either on the accomplishment of the act or on the responsibility ensuing from it.\"198\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 157-159; RER-Ubico 1, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 90-91.\n\nR-Mem.

France)*, PCIJ Series A/B Fascicule No. 74, Decision on Preliminary Objections, 14 June 1938 (\"*Phosphates*\"), p. 22.\n\n181.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal is empowered to go beyond a party's characterization of its claim. In the context of Article XII(3)(d), when the BIT refers to a measure that is \"alleged to be in breach,\" this does not mean that a tribunal must take the Claimant's word for what is in fact alleged in the complaint. According to the Respondent, \"[n]othing in Article XII(3)(d) divests the Tribunal of the power to examine what Claimant's case is actually about,\" and \"it is clear that the measure centrally at issue in the case is the TCA's annulment of Infinito's 2008 Concession.\"199 The word \"alleged\" is used to qualify the word \"breach\" simply because the absence of that qualifier would be inappropriate when a breach has not yet been established.200\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 131(a).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 131(a).\n\n(ii) *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant denies that its case is about the 2010 TCA Decision. It argues that the Tribunal must focus on the case as it has pleaded it. Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, the Claimant asserts that it does not \"really\" challenge the 2010 TCA Decision \"for the simple reason that that decision was neither final nor the proximate cause of the loss of Infinito's rights and damages.\"201 Rather, the Claimant's case is that, as a composite whole, the four measures that it challenges (specifically, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision) \"had the combined effect of stripping Infinito of all of its rights, barring it from seeking any sort of meaningful remedy, and eliminating any possibility of proceeding with the Crucitas project.\"202 In particular, it was the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which rendered the 2010 TCA Decision final, thereby crystallizing the annulment of the Concession and related approvals. The Claimant explains that it challenges this decision, among other measures, because until the release of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, no breach of the BIT had occurred.203\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 222.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 157.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 222.\n\n183.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must hear its claims as it has pleaded them, not as the Respondent attempts to redefine them. Tribunals have consistently found that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must consider \"presumed or supposed violations of [the Treaty as] invoked by the Claimant.\"204\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 223 (emphasis in original), referring to Exh. **RL-0035**, *Waste Management v.

Likewise, the \"breach\" that has been alleged must be assessed as pleaded by the Claimant. To suggest otherwise would strip the word \"alleged\" of its ordinary meaning.205 The Claimant notes in this respect that the term \"alleged\" is being used as a verb, not an adjective, and that, contrary to the Respondent's suggestion, the term \"breach\" is often unaccompanied by the qualifier \"alleged.\"206\n\nC-Rej.

Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 225-226.\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant: it is the Claimant's prerogative to formulate its claims as it sees fit. As stated in *ECE Projektmanagement* :\n\n[I]t is for the investor to allege and formulate its claims of breach of relevant treaty standards as it sees fit. It is not the place of the respondent State to recast those claims in a different manner of its own choosing and the Claimants' claims accordingly fall to be assessed on the basis on which they are pleaded.207\n\nExh. **CL-0135**, *ECE Projektmanagement,* \u00b6 4,743.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this conclusion is supported by the express language of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT, which stipulates that \"[a]n investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration [...] only if [...] (d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is *alleged* to be in breach of this Agreement\" (emphasis added). The Tribunal is persuaded that the ordinary meaning of the term \"alleged,\" which is used as a verb in this context, is \"pleaded\" or \"claimed.\" Further, at the jurisdictional stage, a tribunal must be guided by the case as put forward by the claimant in order to avoid breaching the claimant's due process rights. To proceed otherwise is to incur the risk of dismissing the case based on arguments not put forward by the claimant, at a great procedural cost for that party.\n\n187.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal must assess the case before it focusing on the measures that the Claimant has deemed fit to challenge, and determine its jurisdiction, the admissibility of these claims and, if appropriate, the *prima facie* existence of rights to be protected at the merits phase, on that basis. It is a different question whether, assuming there is jurisdiction and admissibility, the claims as raised are founded or not. This is a matter for the merits stage where the Claimant will have to establish that the claims as presented arise from breaches of the BIT and caused a compensable loss.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this respect that the Claimant asserts that the following measures breached the BIT:208\n\na. The November 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, \"thereby rendering final and irreversible the annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change permit.\"209\n\nb. The June 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which Infinito alleges declined on preliminary admissibility grounds to resolve the conflict between its earlier decision upholding the constitutionality of the Las Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010 TCA Decision.210\n\nc. The January 2012 MINAE Resolution, which Infinito alleges cancelled the 2008 Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito's mining rights from the mining registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.211\n\nd. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium on open-pit mining, which the Claimant alleges replaced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, prohibiting Industrias Infinito from applying for new permits.212\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56. Although in its Memorial on the Merits the Claimant also challenged a fifth measure, the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the Claimant has withdrawn its challenge to that decision \"because the government and SINAC appealed it to the Administrative Chamber in December 2015\" and \"[a]s a result, the decision is not final or binding on Industrias Infinito.\" However, the Claimant \"reserves its right to challenge as an ancillary measure any future Administrative Chamber decision that breaches the BIT.\" C-CM Jur., \u00b6 44.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(a); Exh. **C-0261**, Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(b); Exh. **C-0283**, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (19 June 2013).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(c); Exh. **C-0268**, Resolution No. 0037, MINAE, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012).

Are the Acts Challenged by the Claimant \"measures\" for Purposes of theBIT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent denies that judicial measures can be considered \"measures\" capable of breaching the BIT. For this reason, it contends that the Claimant cannot challenge the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, nor the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision (nor, for that matter, the 2010 TCA Decision, which according to the Respondent is the \"real\" measure at issue).\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the term \"measure\" is specifically defined in the BIT, which is unusual. The definition includes \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,\" with no reference to judgments.213 It is thus \"irrelevant that the term 'measure' is *normally* understood to include judgments, because the Parties have adopted a special and narrower definition that must be given effect.\"214 The Claimant's position is incoherent in this respect: while it acknowledges that the BIT contains a special definition of the term \"measure,\" it then proceeds to ignore that definition, asserting that the term is generally understood to encompass judicial measures.215\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 131(b).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 131(b) (emphasis in original).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(a).\n\n192.\n\nEven if the BIT's definition of \"measure\" should be read to include judicial measures, it does not follow that judicial breaches must be arbitrable. According to the Respondent, \"[i]t is quite common for investment treaties to provide protection against a wide range of breaches, but to restrict international dispute resolution concerning such measures to a narrower subset.\"216\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(b).\n\n193.\n\nFinally, as noted in paragraph 264 *infra*, the Respondent submits that this interpretation of the term \"measure\" is consistent with its interpretation that Article XII(3)(d) excludes challenges to decisions by Costa Rica's judiciary.\n\n(ii) *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that judicial measures constitute \"measures\" for the purposes of the BIT. It notes that, according to Article I(i) of the BIT, a \"measure\" includes \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,\" which encompasses judicial decisions and processes, as recognized by the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and by international tribunals.217 While the ordinary meaning of a term may be supplanted by a special agreed meaning, the party invoking a special meaning must meet a high burden of proof, which the Respondent has failed to meet.218 To the contrary, the list in Article I(i) of the BIT is non-exhaustive (as evidenced by the use of the word \"includes\") and already encompasses judicial measures (which are included in the categories of law, procedure, requirement and practice).219\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 188, citing Exh. **CL-0007**, International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts*, II(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission (2001), Art. 4; Exh. **CL-0075**, *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v.

As noted in that section, judicial measures may be challenged under the BIT if they are final and not subject to further appeal. This interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the provision in its context and in light of the object and purpose of the BIT. By contrast, Costa Rica's interpretation of Article XII(3)(d), would also exclude any challenge to a judicial measure, even if the claim is for denial of justice or expropriation.220\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 169.\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n196.\n\nThere is no dispute that two of the measures challenged by the Claimant constitute \"measures\" for the purposes of the BIT, namely, the 2012 MINAE Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium. The question arises with respect to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which are judicial decisions. The Claimant asserts that judicial measures qualify as \"measures\" for the purposes of the BIT, while the Respondent denies this.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that judicial decisions are indeed \"measures\" for the purposes of the BIT. First, it notes that the definition of \"measure\" in Article I(i) of the BIT is very wide and non-exhaustive. It includes \"any [...] procedure,\" which in the Tribunal's view encompasses judicial procedures and, by necessary implication, judicial decisions, which are the ultimate goal of any judicial procedure and thus an inherent part of them. The Tribunal also notes that this same definition has been used in other treaties such as NAFTA221 and CAFTA,222 and tribunals have invariably concluded that it covered judicial measures.223\n\nExh. **CL-0113**, NAFTA, Art. 201.\n\nExh. **CL-0112**, CAFTA, Art. 2.1.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Exh. **CL-0166**, *Loewen*, *Jurisdiction*, \u00b6 40; Exh. **CL-0221**, *Spence*, \u00b6 276; and Exh. **RL-0020**, *Apotex*, \u00b6\u00b6 333-334, 337(a).\n\n198.\n\nSecond, the ILC Articles on State Responsibility consider that the acts of the State organs exercising judicial functions constitute acts of State which may give rise to the international responsibility of the State.224\n\nExh. **CL-0007**, International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts*, II(2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission (2001), Art. 4, 12 and 28.\n\n199.\n\nFinally, as explained in Section IV.C.4.a(iii) *infra* in the context of Article XII(3)(d), the Tribunal considers that including judicial decisions in the concept of \"measure\" is consistent with the context of that provision and with the object and purpose of the BIT.\n\n200.\n\nAccordingly, all of the measures that the Claimant alleges are in breach of the BIT can be considered \"measures\" for purposes of Articles XII(1), XII(2) and XII(3)(d) of the BIT.\n\n**c. Are the Claimant's Claims Genuine Claims under the BIT, or Do They Amount to a Disagreement with Costa Rican Courts on Matters of Domestic Law?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's claims are not genuine claims under the BIT; they merely express a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law. Citing international commentary and jurisprudence, it is submitted that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to act as a court of appeal on matters of domestic law.225 The Tribunal is simply not competent to \"second-guess [a local] court's interpretation and application of local law.\"226 The Respondent refers in particular to the following comment from the *Helnan* tribunal :\n\nAn ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the Tribunal will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies, in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from the viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of justice.227\n\nR-Mem.

However, it contends that the Claimant \"cannot manufacture international jurisdiction simply by labelling its disagreement with domestic court judgments as breaches of the BIT.\"228 This is confirmed by the *Azinian*229 and *Iberdrola*230 decisions.

If it were sufficient that the parties simply invoked a violation of international standards to assert ICSID jurisdiction, any analysis of *ratione materiae* jurisdiction would lack practical sense and would be limited to stating that the parties simply invoke the substantive norms of the BIT.\" (Unofficial translation from Spanish. The original Spanish reads: *\"El Comit\u00e9 considera que los tribunales tienen facultades para calificar legalmente las peticiones de las partes [...].

For instance, it ignores that the different chambers of the Supreme Court confirmed that there was no conflict between the allegedly conflicting judgments invoked by the Claimant.234 Nor has the Claimant challenged the independence or good faith of the Costa Rican courts.235\n\nR-Mem.

For the Respondent, the \"[m]ere misapplication of domestic law, even if proven, is insufficient to establish a breach of international law, yet Claimant does not contend (or present any evidence to suggest) that Costa Rica's courts and administrative authorities did anything more than apply the law as they understood it in good faith.\"238\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 145.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 146.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 12.\n\n205.\n\nUnless the Tribunal is able to assume Costa Rican appellate jurisdiction and accept that the TCA's rulings (as upheld by the Administrative Chamber) were incorrect as a matter of Costa Rican law, the Claimant's case concerning the annulment of the 2008 Concession fails:239\n\na. The arbitrariness claim fails in the face of correct (or even good-faith) application of domestic law.\n\nb. The legitimate expectations claim fails because the expectation of engaging in an activity cannot be legitimate if it is illegal under domestic law.\n\nc. The expropriation claim fails because no wrongful taking can result from the legitimate application of Costa Rica's legal system.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 147.\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that none of the Claimant's remaining claims (specifically, its denial of justice claim and its claims against the 2012 MINAE Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium) is supported by any evidence that withstands *prima facie* scrutiny, and therefore fail on that basis240.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 149-150.\n\n(ii) *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant denies that there is any merit to the Respondent's contention that Infinito's BIT claims amount to \"labelling\" and are not genuine. The arguments that the Respondent makes under this heading are essentially the same as those advanced in its objection that the Claimant has not made a *prima facie* case of breaches of the BIT. As explained in Section IV.C.3.d(ii) *infra*, the Claimant asserts that it \"has established both on a balance of probabilities and on a *prima facie* basis that the various measures which it challenges breached the BIT.\"241\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 461.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the cases cited by the Respondent to support the proposition that this Tribunal is not a court of appeal on issues of Costa Rican law are inapposite. The Claimant \"does not contest [\u2026] that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to determining whether the four administrative and judicial measures at issue constitute breaches of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT (i.e. breaches of international, rather than domestic, law).\"242 Most of its claims do not depend on whether the Costa Rican courts correctly applied Costa Rican law, and for the one claim in which Infinito does challenge the application of Costa Rican law by local courts, such challenge is validly brought under the BIT.243 For those claims in which Costa Rican law is relevant, the Tribunal may consider the correctness with which Costa Rican law was applied as part of its analysis of whether the Respondent has breached the BIT: the question for this Tribunal is \"not whether Costa Rican domestic law was misapplied, but whether the failure to correctly apply domestic law in addition to other relevant facts constitutes a breach of the BIT.\"244 In this context, the application of domestic law forms part of the Tribunal's factual analysis.245\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 462.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 362-366; C-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 462-467.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 365.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 365.\n\n209.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimant submits that:\n\na. Neither the legitimate expectations nor the expropriation claim depend on whether Costa Rican courts correctly applied Costa Rican law (in particular, the 2002 Moratorium). Although the Respondent relies on its domestic law as a defense, it is well-established that a State cannot rely on its internal law to justify an internationally wrongful act.246\n\nb. The procedural denial of justice claim, the claim for breach of FET because the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was arbitrary, and the full protection and security claim are based on expert evidence that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision conflicted with binding decisions of the Constitutional Chamber. As explained in paragraph 163 *supra*, the Claimant asserts that there is no mechanism available in Costa Rica to resolve that conflict. While the Administrative Chamber considered that there was no conflict, under Costa Rican law only the Constitutional Chamber is empowered to make that decision, but there is no mechanism allowing it to do so.\n\nc. The substantive denial of justice claim is the only claim which implies that the Tribunal find that the Administrative Chamber incorrectly applied Costa Rican law by applying the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession and other project approvals. The Claimant submits that, \"in the context of a substantive denial of justice claim, the Tribunal has the power to determine whether the Administrative Chamber's failure to properly apply Costa Rican law also amounts to breaches of the BIT.\"247 Citing Dolzer and Schreuer, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal is not bound by the findings of the Administrative Chamber in deciding whether its decision was arbitrary, or whether Infinito was denied justice or legal security.248 The Claimant accepts that the task of applying and interpreting domestic law lies primarily with the courts of the host country, but this is not exclusively so: where domestic law is applied in a manner that is evidently arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic, or in breach of a fundamental right, international liability arises.249 Citing *Chevron*, the Claimant further contends that \"the defectiveness of internal law, the refusal to apply it, or its wrongful application by judges [can] constitute elements of proof of a denial of justice, in the international understanding of the expression.\"250\n\nC-Rej.

Jur., \u00b6 362.\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the BIT, because the claims amount to no more than a disagreement with the Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law. The Claimant contests this, arguing that Infinito's claims are all grounded on breaches of the BIT. It also submits that whether or not Costa Rican law was applied incorrectly is part of the factual analysis which the Tribunal must carry out in respect of certain BIT breaches.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is defined by Article XII(1) of the BIT (read in conjunction with Article XII(2)). Accordingly, the Tribunal's jurisdiction extends to \"[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\" This provision clearly sets out that the Tribunal's subject-matter jurisdiction extends to disputes relating to claims that (i) a measure taken or not taken by the host State is in breach of the BIT, and that (ii) the investor has incurred loss or damage as a result of that breach.\n\n213.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, for jurisdictional purposes, it suffices to establish the existence of (i) a claim that a measure breaches the BIT, and of (ii) a claim that such breach has caused the investor loss or damage.\n\n214.\n\nWith respect to (i), the Tribunal has already found that it must focus on the claim as pleaded by the Claimant. Here, the Claimant is clearly and unequivocally arguing that the four measures identified at paragraph 188 *supra* have breached several of the Respondent's obligations under the BIT, namely its obligations under Article II(a) (fair and equitable treatment or the CIL minimum standard), Article II(b) (full protection and security), and Article VIII (expropriation). The jurisdictional requirement under (i) is thus met.\n\n215.\n\nWith respect to (ii), it is also undisputed that the Claimant claims that the breaches identified above have caused it loss or damage. The Tribunal thus finds that this jurisdictional requirement is also met.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent also objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the grounds that the Claimant has neither made a *prima facie* case of the breaches it alleges, nor of the damage it claims arose from these breaches. The Tribunal addresses these objections in Sections IV.C.3.d and IV.C.3.e *infra*.\n\n217.\n\nThis does not mean that the Tribunal will not consider the Respondent's argument that the claims merely represent a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on domestic law. The Tribunal agrees that it is not its role to act as a court of appeal with respect to decisions of domestic courts. That said, it is the Tribunal's duty to verify if the measures complained of have breached the BIT. The Tribunal notes in this respect that only two of the measures complained of are judicial measures (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision). As such, the Respondent's argument can only apply to these two measures. However, the Claimant has expressly brought claims of denial of justice against those measures. Whether these claims are well-founded (in particular, whether they go beyond a mere disagreement between the Claimant and Costa Rican courts on the application of municipal law) is a matter for the merits.\n\n**d. Has the Claimant Made a** ***Prima Facie*** **Case of Any of the Alleged Breaches of the BIT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Claimant must make a *prima facie* case that the conduct of which it complains is capable of breaching the BIT. For the Respondent, the appropriate analysis in the face of a preliminary objection to jurisdiction was articulated by Judge Higgins in the *Oil Platforms* case, according to which the tribunal must \"accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the applicable treaty] for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of the claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of [the treaty provisions].\"252 In other words, the test is to assess whether, on the facts alleged by the Claimant, the challenged acts are capable of violating the BIT.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 202, citing Exh. **RL-0085**, *Oil Platforms (Iran v. USA),* International Court of Justice, Opinion of Judge Higgins, 12 December 1996 (\"*Oil Platforms*\"), \u00b6 32.\n\n219.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant \"cannot meet the *prima facie* test by simply labelling the disputed conduct as a treaty breach.\"253 Citing *Impregilo* and *Burlington*, the Tribunal cannot limit itself to the Claimant's characterization of the case.254\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 205.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 205, citing Exh. **RL-0087**, *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010 (\"*Burlington*\"), \u00b6 110.\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that a *prima facie* case must be supported with *prima facie* evidence. While that evidence need not be sufficient to show that the claim is well founded, it must at least demonstrate that there is some truth behind a claimant's allegations. In addition, such *prima facie* evidence need not be accepted *pro tem* if the respondent submits other evidence that conclusively contradicts the claimant's assertions. Citing *Chevron I*, the Respondent argues that, if from the evidence submitted in the jurisdictional phase \"the Tribunal finds that facts alleged by the Claimant[] are shown to be false or insufficient to satisfy the *prima facie* test, jurisdiction would have to be denied.\"255\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 206-207, citing Exh. **RL-0095**, *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Corporation v. The Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 1 December 2008 (\"*Chevron I*\"), \u00b6 110.\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent argues that here, the Claimant has failed to make a *prima facie* showing of any of the breaches of the BIT that it alleges. According to the Respondent, the conduct that the Claimant attributes to Costa Rica, even if it were proven, would not violate the relevant standards, and in those cases in which the Claimant's assertions could plausibly give rise to a breach of the BIT, those allegations find no support in the evidentiary record.256\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 209-301.\n\n222.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's arguments, the Respondent denies that the Tribunal must accept the Claimant's factual and legal allegations as true on their face. According to the Respondent, \"the Tribunal's role at the jurisdictional stage is to determine, based on its own review of the available evidence, whether the relevant State conduct could be deemed to constitute a substantive breach of the BIT within Costa Rica's consent to arbitration under Article XII.\"257\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 105.\n\n223.\n\nRelying on *Emmis*, the Respondent submits that a tribunal must engage in two distinct types of inquiries at the jurisdictional stage, each having a different level of inquiry. The first type of inquiry \"relates to questions of fact that must be definitively determined at the jurisdictional stage,\" while \"[t]he second involves questions of fact that go to the merits, which the Tribunal must ordinarily not prejudge, unless they are plainly without foundation.\"258 The second inquiry \"necessarily involves assessing whether the alleged conduct of the [r]espondent is capable of constituting a breach of the substantive protections of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the [t]ribunal *ratione materiae* but this has to be determined on a *prima facie* basis only.\"259 According to the Respondent, the Claimant attempts to conflate these two inquiries, and mistakenly argues that it must only make a *prima facie* showing with respect to both jurisdictional and merits inquiries.260\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 106, citing Exh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis and Others v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014 (\"*Emmis*\"), \u00b6 172 (emphasis removed).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 106, citing Exh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis,* \u00b6 172.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 107.\n\n224.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal may conclusively determine issues of fact and law at the jurisdictional stage. In particular, it must determine decisively those issues that are essential to establish jurisdiction, such as the existence or ownership of an investment, or threshold requirements of the BIT or the ICSID Convention.261 Citing *Ampal-American*, the Respondent submits that it is \"not only appropriate, but necessary, for the Tribunal to hold Claimant to a higher level of proof than a *prima facie* showing for all issues bearing directly on the question of jurisdiction.\"262 For the Respondent, \"[t]his means that the Tribunal does not have to take Infinito's assertions or evidence at face value;\" it \"should test the Claimant's characterizations and its evidence in order to make its jurisdictional determinations.\"263\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 108-109 citing Exh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis,* \u00b6 174.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 110-111 citing Exh. **RL-0168**, *Ampal-American Israel Corporation and Others v.

The Claimant emphasizes that the Tribunal's current task is to determine whether it has jurisdiction, but it must refrain from prejudging the merits.273\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 295-298.\n\n229.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent is inappropriately requesting the Tribunal to engage in a detailed legal interpretation of the substantive provisions of the BIT, including (i) the scope of the FET protection in Article II, (ii) whether Infinito's legitimate expectations are relevant to determining whether that standard has been breached, and (iii) whether judicial decisions can only violate the BIT if they amount to a denial of justice. The jurisdictional stage is not the place for this analysis.274 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he Tribunal need simply be satisfied that the claims, as formulated by the claimant, could fall under the scope of the substantive BIT provisions the claimant invokes;\" \"[o]nly where a substantive protection is ' plainly incapable ' of bearing the claim put forth by the claimant will it be appropriate for that claim to be dismissed on a *prima facie* basis.\"275 Citing *Chevron I*, the Claimant argues that, at the jurisdictional stage, \"[t]o require a claimant to prove its interpretation of substantive BIT provisions is to 'prejudge the merits of the dispute.'\"276\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 302.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 302 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 302.\n\n230.\n\nLikewise, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must accept the Claimant's evidence on its face. It must not assess the weight of the fact and expert evidence put forward by the Claimant.277 The Respondent has acknowledged that \"the Tribunal must 'accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged' by the Claimant 'to be true.'\"278 Citing the *Oil Platforms* case, the Claimant argues that \"[i]t is only at the merits stage that a tribunal 'has jurisdiction to determine exactly what the facts are and see whether they do sustain a violation' of the BIT.\"279 The Respondent's reliance on *Chevron I* and *II* is misplaced: in *Chevron I*, the tribunal was dealing with a situation where there was conflicting evidence that could have demonstrated that the facts alleged by the Claimant were false,280 and in *Chevron II*, the tribunal addressed the possibility that the facts pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration (not the evidence submitted by the claimant) would not be accepted as true if they were \"incredible, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise advanced by the claimant in bad faith.\"281 Here, the Respondent has not identified a single piece of evidence adduced by Infinito that should not be accepted on its face on the basis of the situations contemplated in the *Chevron* cases.282\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 298, 305-308.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 306, citing R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 202.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 306, citing Exh. **RL-0085**, *Oil Platforms*, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 307, citing Exh. **RL-0095**, *Chevron I*, \u00b6\u00b6 110-112.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 307, citing Exh. **RL-0096,** *Chevron II*, \u00b6 4.6.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 308.\n\n231.\n\nIn answer to the Respondent's arguments on the appropriate standard of review for the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant articulates the following principles:283\n\na. The facts and law that are necessary to determine jurisdiction may be assessed rigorously. At the jurisdictional stage, tribunals may definitively determine questions of fact that relate to jurisdiction, such as whether there was an investment, or an investor, but these questions do not arise in this case. The cases on which the Respondent relies all relate to this type of inquiry.\n\nb. By contrast, the facts and law that are relevant to the merits must be considered on a *prima facie* standard. The Tribunal must accept the Claimant's factual allegations relating to the merits unless they are plainly without foundation. The Respondent cannot cite a single arbitral decision where the tribunal engaged, at the jurisdictional stage, in a detailed review of the factual evidence to determine whether a substantive BIT standard had been breached. Nor is it appropriate for the Tribunal to engage in a detailed analysis of the BIT's substantive provisions at this stage.\n\nc. The Tribunal's analysis should be based on the Claimant's allegations, not on the Respondent's reformulation of the case. The Claimant submits that \"Infinito is free to plead its claims as it deems appropriate,\" and \"is entitled to provide facts and legal theory in support of its arguments. In response, Costa Rica is entitled to provide its own facts and legal theory. The Tribunal then considers both sides' positions, in light of the allegations made by the claimant. The claimant's facts and argument are not shielded from arbitral review; but the Tribunal's analysis must be based on the claimant's case, not the respondent's recasting of it.\"284\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 121-129, citing Exh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis*, \u00b6\u00b6 172,174.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 128 (emphasis in original).\n\n232.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant contends that not only has it satisfied the low *prima facie* standard applicable at the jurisdictional stage; it has also shown that Costa Rica has breached its obligations under the Articles II, VIII, and IV of the BIT on the standard applicable to the Tribunal's assessment of the merits, *i.e.*, the balance of probabilities standard.\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n233.\n\nBoth Parties appear to agree that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must engage in two separate inquiries, each of which entail a different standard of review. As noted in *Emmis* (on which both Parties rely),285 the first inquiry refers to facts that go to jurisdiction. The second inquiry involves the merits of the breaches claimed.\n\nExh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis*, \u00b6 172.\n\n234.\n\nThe Parties appear to differ on the identification of the facts that fall within the ambit of the first inquiry. For the Tribunal, it is clear that all the facts that underlie the jurisdictional requirements set by the ICSID Convention and the BIT must be established - proven - at the jurisdictional stage. If these facts are not established, the Tribunal must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n235.\n\nThus, the Tribunal must finally assess whether the facts that prove the following requirements are established:286\n\ni. Whether there is a legal dispute (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and Article XII(1) of the BIT).\n\nii. Whether that dispute arises directly out of an investment (Article 25 of the ICSID Convention).\n\niii. Whether that investment qualifies as such under Article I(g) of the BIT, including whether it is owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican Law (Article I(g) of the BIT in connection with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article XII(1) of the BIT).\n\niv. Whether the Parties qualify as a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State); and an \"investor\" of another Contracting State (Article 25 ICSID of the ICSID Convention, and Article XII(1) of the BIT).\n\nv. Whether the Parties have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and Article XII(3)(a) of the BIT).\n\nvi. Whether the dispute relates to a claim that a measure breaches the BIT (Article XII(1) of the BIT).\n\nvii. Whether the dispute relates to a claim that the investor has incurred a loss or damage (Article XII(1) of the BIT).\n\nviii. Whether a period of six months has elapsed since the notice of dispute and the Parties have attempted to settle the dispute amicably (Article XII(2) of the BIT).\n\nix. Whether the Claimant has waived its right to other proceedings in relation to the measures (Article XII(3)(b) of the BIT).\n\nx. Whether more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage (Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT).\n\nxi. Whether a judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of the BIT (Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT).\n\nAs noted *supra*, \u00b6 174 and explained further *infra*, \u00b6 343, the Tribunal will determine whether the requirement set out under Article XII(3)(c) is jurisdictional in nature at the merits stage; and it considers that the issue whether the requirement in Article XII(3)(d) is jurisdictional or admissibility is of no consequence in light of the Tribunal's finding in Section IV.C.4.a(iii) *infra*.\n\n236.\n\nAs noted in Sections IV.B and IV.C.2 *supra*, the Parties agree that the jurisdictional requirements listed above in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv), (viii) and (ix) are met. The Parties also agree that the requirement listed at sub-paragraph (iii) (existence of an investment protected under the BIT) is met, but given APREFLOFAS's argument that the investment was not obtained in accordance with Costa Rican law, the Tribunal has deferred this issue to the merits. The Parties dispute whether the remaining requirements have been met. The Tribunal has already found that those in subparagraphs (vi) and (vii) are present, *i.e.* an alleged claim which relates to a breach of the BIT and which relates to an alleged loss caused by the alleged breach. As for consent (requirement (v)), the Parties diverge on requirements (x) and (xi), which the Tribunal addresses in Sections IV.C.4.a and IV.C.4.b *infra*. The analysis of these latter requirements will complete the first inquiry under the *Emmis* standard, *i.e*. the inquiry referring to facts going to jurisdiction or admissibility.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal must next engage in the second inquiry, which is to assess *prima facie* whether the claims asserted may constitute treaty breaches. For the Tribunal, this is equivalent to the *pro tem* test articulated by Judge Higgins in the *Oil Platforms* case. Accordingly, to determine whether the claims are \"sufficiently plausibly based\" upon the applicable treaty, the appropriate analysis \"is to accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the applicable treaty] for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of [the claimant's] claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more [provisions of the treaty].\"287\n\nExh. **RL-0085**, *Oil Platforms*, \u00b6 32.\n\n238.\n\nIn making this *prima facie* determination, the Tribunal must first assume the facts as the Claimant alleges them. *Pro tem* - *pro tempore*, that is for the time being - the Tribunal must accept that the facts alleged will later be proven. Second, the Tribunal must review whether the facts alleged are susceptible of constituting breaches of the treaty's guarantees of protections as it understands these guarantees. To this second inquiry, the Tribunal must apply a *prima facie* standard of review, both in respect of the capacity of the facts to fall within the ambit of the treaty protections and of the understanding of these protections.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal is neither required nor entitled to engage in a review exceeding the *prima facie* standard. The *Emmis* tribunal expressly recognized this, when it stated that the second inquiry \"necessarily involves assessing whether the alleged conduct of the [r]espondent is capable of constituting a breach of the substantive protections of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the [t]ribunal *ratione materiae* but this has to be determined on a *prima facie* basis only.\"288 Similarly, the *Abaclat* tribunal restated the *pro tem* test as follows:\n\n[T]he task of the Tribunal at the stage of determining whether it has jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in determining whether the facts alleged by the claimant(s), if established, are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which have been invoked [...]. In performing this task, the Tribunal applies a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on its face.289\n\nExh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis*, \u00b6 172.\n\nExh. **CL-0115**, *Abaclat*, \u00b6 303.\n\n240.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will not engage now in a detailed analysis of the facts alleged or of the substantive provisions of the BIT. As noted by Judge Higgins in her separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case, it is for the merits \"to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the treaty provisions]; and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation [\u2026]. In short, it is at the merits that one sees 'whether there really has been a breach.'\"290\n\nExh. **RL-0085**, *Oil Platforms*, \u00b6 34.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that it is essential to clearly distinguish the limited *prima facie* review at the jurisdictional level from the full-fledged review that will be undertaken at the merits stage. Going beyond a *prima facie* test at such an incipient stage of the proceedings creates a risk of breach of due process. In bifurcated proceedings, the disputing parties expect that the merits will be tried in the subsequent phase of the arbitration and do not put before the tribunal at the jurisdictional stage the entire spectrum of evidence and argument that is reserved for the merits. As a result, if the Tribunal delves too deeply into the merits at the jurisdictional stage, without having the benefit of a complete record and full submissions, the Parties can be deprived of the opportunity to fully present and defend their case, as required by fundamental principles of procedure. Moreover, exceeding the strict bounds of the *pro tem* or *prima facie* test imperils the manageability and efficiency of the proceedings. Applying an expansive test, such as the one put forward by the Respondent, could result in trying the case twice whenever the Tribunal upholds jurisdiction, thus resulting in unnecessary costs and delays.\n\n242.\n\nThis being so, while noting that at the jurisdictional stage one should not prejudge facts that go to the merits, the Tribunal considers that an exception needs to be made when these facts are \"plainly without foundation.\"291 This is not the case here. With a few minor exceptions, the Parties agree on the main facts, in particular on the existence of the measures alleged by the Claimant. What they do disagree on is the legal characterization and impact of these facts and whether they amount to breaches of the BIT. However, these are all properly issues for the merits. In the absence of manifestly false factual allegations, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the *pro tem* test.\n\nExh. **RL-0086**, *Emmis*, \u00b6 172.\n\n243.\n\nOn the basis of these principles, the Tribunal has no hesitation concluding that the *pro tem* or *prima facie* test is met. For the purposes of jurisdiction, and on a *prima facie* basis only, the Tribunal holds that the facts alleged could potentially amount to a treaty breach. Whether such a breach, would actually constitute an unlawful expropriation, a breach of FET or of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, or a denial of justice, is a determination that exceeds the ambit of the present inquiry and belongs to the merits analysis. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant challenges non-judicial measures, which on a *prima facie* basis may also potentially constitute treaty breaches.\n\n244.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant has satisfied the *prima facie* test needed to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. In other words, it has shown that the facts which it alleges, if accepted as true, could entail breaches of the BIT.\n\n**e. Must Infinito Make a** ***Prima Facie*** **Case on Damages and, if So, Has It DoneSo?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nArticles XII(1) and XII(2) of the BIT provide that an investor may submit to arbitration \"[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the BIT conditions a valid claim on the existence of both (i) a measure alleged to have breached the BIT and (ii) a specification of loss or damage arising out of the alleged breach. This means that a claimant must establish a *prima facie* case for both (i) an alleged breach and (ii) an alleged damage flowing from such breach. If the claimant does not identify the loss or damage resulting from the measure, then it fails to state a *prima facie* claim.292\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 303; R-Reply Jur., \u00b6 255.\n\n247.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish a *prima facie* case for both breach and damage. The Respondent's arguments regarding a *prima facie* case on the alleged breach are addressed in Section IV.C.3.d *supra*. The Respondent's arguments regarding a *prima facie* case on damages are reviewed here.\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to present a plausible theory of loss or damage attributable to any of the measures it has identified as being in breach of the BIT293 for the following reasons:\n\na. First, the Claimant has asserted that its investment in Costa Rica lost all value as a result of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (indeed, on the Claimant's damages theory, this is the only cause asserted for the Claimant's alleged damage). However, the Respondent contends that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was not the true cause of the Claimant's loss; the true cause was the 2010 TCA Decision, which annulled the Claimant's 2008 Concession.294\n\nb. Second, even if the 2010 TCA Decision was not the true cause of the Claimant's loss, the Claimant has failed to show what specific damage the 2011 Administrative Chamber decision caused to its business. The Claimant's main argument appears to be that it suffered losses \"based on stock valuations, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are often based on nothing more than a hope or wishful thinking;\" \"[b]ut a loss of hope is not a compensable injury for which a tribunal may award damages in international arbitration.\"295 As to the Claimant's argument that it continued to spend money on the project in the period between the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, it is likely that \"such money related to the legal actions it was pursuing at the time, as it was affirmatively barred from undertaking any development on the project during the pendency of the cassation request.\"296\n\nc. Third, if the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is the true cause of the Claimant's losses, it is unclear how the Claimant could have \"incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of\" later measures.297 By its own admission, its losses became final, and its investment in Costa Rica substantially worthless, with the issuance of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision:298 \"It is logically impossible for something that *has already been lost* to be lost again through a subsequent act.\"299 Citing *Pey Casado*, the Respondent contends that \"a claimant must prove damages for each relevant act and cannot pretend that its damages were caused by one act when in fact they were caused by another.\"300\n\nd. Fourth, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium could not have caused the Claimant any damage because this moratorium did not deprive the Claimant of the possibility to obtain a new concession, which it had lost before through the 2010 Executive Moratorium. The Respondent presumes that the Claimant chose not to challenge those decrees because they are \"evidently outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\"301 In addition, the 2010 TCA Decision ordered the Las Crucitas area to be reforested, thus precluding the Claimant's possibility of obtaining new mining rights.302 Even if the Claimant could have potentially sought *new* mining rights, it has \"failed to explain how the vaguely defined hope to acquire new mining rights could qualify as a genuine *loss* under the BIT.\"303\n\nR-Mem.

At that time, the annulment of Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession and other project approvals was rendered complete, final and irreversible under Costa Rican law.305 Pending the proceedings before the Administrative Chamber, the 2010 TCA Decision was contingent, suspended, and capable of being reversed in full.306 This is supported by Costa Rican law, Infinito's actions, the response of public markets, and the actions of the Government of Costa Rica. It is also confirmed in the First and Second Reports of FTI Consulting, who analyzed Infinito's financial statements, changes in market capitalization, management actions and public disclosure, investing activities after the relevant decisions, contemporaneous actions of the Costa Rican Government, and contemporaneous Costa Rican media statements.307 The Claimant notes that Costa Rica has not presented expert evidence to the contrary. As to the Respondent's arguments on the value of the evidence submitted by Infinito, the Claimant contends that \"[f]or a publicly-traded company, its share price reflects real value,\" and notes that \"the price of Infinito's shares has remained at close to zero since the Administrative Chamber's decision\" and \"[t]here is no reason to think it will recover.\"308\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 470.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 475.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 476, citing CER-FTI Consulting 2, \u00b6\u00b6 3.1, 5.2, 5.28-5.30, 5.51, 5.56, 5.62, 5.66, 5.75.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 371.\n\n251.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant argues that its evidence must be accepted as true for the purposes of jurisdictional analysis. When assessing jurisdiction, \"the question is whether the facts alleged, taken to be true, 'may be capable' of breaching the BIT's protections.\"309 Thus, at this stage, the Tribunal must accept the expert evidence provided by the Claimant regarding Infinito's losses and the cause of those losses.310 Costa Rica is asking the Tribunal to prejudge the merits and decide now that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision caused no loss.311 According to the Claimant, the only investment tribunal that has declined jurisdiction on this basis (in *Telenor*) found that the claimant had failed to establish a *prima facie* case of expropriation because it had failed to adduce any fact or expert evidence to prove that its investments had been rendered substantially worthless.312\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 474, citing Exh. **CL-0134**, *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No 1 Ltd. v.

These other measures prevent Infinito from obtaining a new exploitation concession and new project approvals, or from having the existing concession and approvals restored. As a result, \"these measures operated in combination with the Administrative Chamber's decision to effectively render Infinito's investments substantially worthless.\"315\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 471.\n\n254.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in the case of a composite breach, a claimant is not required to prove separate damages associated with each individual measure.316*Pey Casado*, cited by the Respondent, is inapposite because it did not address whether each individual measure must cause separate damages.317 Here, the Claimant is alleging that its losses only crystallized by the combined operation of the four challenged measures: \"absent the other measures that Infinito challenges, the exploitation concession and other project approvals could have been restored or a new concession and new approvals could have been granted. Had that occurred, then the Crucitas project could have continued, and Infinito's investments would not have been rendered substantially worthless.\"318\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 477-479, citing Exh. **CL-0131**, *Crystallex International Corporation v.

Indeed, what matters for the purposes of a possible *prima facie* test on damages is that the facts *as alleged* may constitute a loss. There is no question that this requirement is met here. What act may constitute a breach, if any, and whether that act can have caused the damages claimed are different questions, which exceed the limited scope of the *prima facie* test and must be dealt with at the merits stage.\n\n**4. The Respondent's Objections under Article XII(3)**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Are the Claimant's Claims Barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT Because They Challenge Measures Regarding which the Costa Rican Courts Have Already Rendered Judgment?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent highlights the unusual nature of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. It first argues that it is not a \"fork-in-the-road\" clause: rather than providing investors with a choice to submit the same *dispute* either to the courts of the host State or to an arbitral tribunal, this clause bars any claim against *measures* \"regarding\" which a Costa Rican court has rendered a judgment. Unlike a fork-in-the-road clause, this provision does not require that the Costa Rican judicial proceedings and the investor-State proceedings satisfy the triple identity test.319 However, in its later submissions, it argues that this provision is similar to (but broader than) a fork-in-the-road clause, although it recognizes that it does not include many of the limitations contained in such clauses.320\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 149.\n\n*See, e.g*., R-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 132; 133(d); 138.\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, this provision must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT. With respect to the ordinary meaning of Article XII(3)(d), the following submissions are made:\n\na. While the starting point should be the ordinary meaning of the provision, an ordinary meaning that leads to an illogical result should not be accepted.321 In addition, where, as here, there are several equally authentic versions of a treaty, it may be necessary to consider the terms in each of the authentic languages.322 Further, in accordance with Article 31(4) of the VCLT, the ordinary meaning does not apply where a special meaning has been agreed by the parties.323\n\nb. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, it is \"clear that Article XII(3)(d) constitutes a limitation of arbitral jurisdiction in an investor-State dispute under the BIT.\"324\n\nc. All that is required to trigger this bar is a judgment of a Costa Rican court \"regarding\" the measure in question. The ordinary meaning of the term \"regarding\" is broad and \"must be understood to cover a broad range of possible relationships between the challenged measure and the relevant Costa Rican judgment,\" denoting \"a situation in which the measure in question has any type of genuine connection with the Costa Rican court judgment.\"325 For the Respondent, the word \"regarding\" must be equated with \"concerning,\" \"about\" or \"related to.\"326 This is consistent with the authentic Spanish version of the provision, which uses the terms \"*relativo a la medida*\" (*i.e*., \"related\" to the measure), and to the equally authentic French version, which uses the words \"*au sujet de la mesure*,\" which the Respondent translates as \"on the subject of\" or \"about\" the measure.327\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 126.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 126.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 126.\n\nR-Mem.

It only applies to cases in which Canadian investors contest measures regarding which a Costa Rican court has issued a judgment, not cases brought by Costa Rican investors against measures taken by Canada. This shows that this provision was specifically negotiated with the Costa Rican judiciary in mind.328\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 153.\n\n259.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"the obvious intended effect of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT is to prevent Canadian investors from overriding the judgments of Costa Rican courts before international arbitral tribunals,\" which \"is precisely what Claimant attempts to do in this arbitration.\"329 As noted above, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal need not accept the Claimant's characterization of the measure, and that the real measure at the heart of the Claimant's case is the 2010 TCA Decision that annulled Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession.330 However, because there are multiple judgments of the Costa Rican courts \"regarding\" this annulment, this claim is barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT:\n\na. The 2010 TCA Decision has been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican court, specifically of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which ruled on Industrias Infinito's cassation request regarding the 2010 TCA Decision.331\n\nb. The 2010 TCA Decision is, in itself, a judgment rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the annulment.332\n\nc. The 2010 TCA Decision was also the subject of the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision.333\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 154.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 179-181.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 161.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 156.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 156.\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent contends that a direct challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision is thus barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. It is for this reason that, in an attempt to circumvent this provision, the Claimant formally challenges other measures. However, this attempt must fail because the claims regarding these measures \"rest almost entirely on the premise that the 2010 TCA Judgment was wrongly decided.\"334\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 169.\n\n261.\n\nIn any event, even if one were to consider that the \"measures\" formally challenged by the Claimant are the relevant measures, they are all barred under Article XII(3)(d) because they are all measures \"regarding\" which the Costa Rican courts have rendered a judgment:\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is in itself a judgment of Costa Rica's highest court. According to the Respondent, \"it is impossible to identify a measure more closely related to a Costa Rican court judgment than a *judicial* 'measure,' especially when such measure consists in upholding *another* Costa Rican court judgment.\"335 A contrary interpretation \"would render the treaty provision essentially meaningless because it could always be circumvented by defining the judicial decision (rather than the act regarding which that judgment was rendered), as the relevant 'measure.'\"336\n\nb. Likewise, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision is also a judgment of a Costa Rican court.337\n\nc. Seen from a different perspective, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAE Resolution are all \"measures\" related to the 2010 TCA Decision, which is in itself a judgment of a Costa Rican Court.338\n\nd. The 2010 Executive Moratorium and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium have also been subject to multiple judgments of the Costa Rican courts. The 2010 Executive Moratorium was comprised of two executive decrees (the Arias Moratorium Decree and the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree), as well as the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, which all were challenged before the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court. In each case, the Constitutional Chamber dismissed the challenge. With respect to the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, the Constitutional Chamber even considered and rejected claims that it violated the BIT (the fact that the plaintiff was not Industrias Infinito is irrelevant for present purposes, because the Article XII(3)(d) does not require that the judgment regarding the \"measure\" involve the same parties).339\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 166 (emphasis in original).\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 167.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 170.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 168, 170.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 172, 133-143.\n\n262.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, all of these judgments are \"regarding\" the annulment of the Claimant's Concession, which is the real measure challenged by the Claimant.340 As recognized in *Methanex*, upon which the Claimant relies, the term \"regarding\" refers to a legally significant connection. For the Respondent, \"[t]here can be no dispute that the connection between Costa Rican judgments and what Claimant's BIT claim is about is a legally significant one.\"341 In any event, the Respondent maintains that it is perfectly possible for a measure to be \"regarding,\" \"concerning\" or \"related to\" itself.342 In addition, \"in the case of judgments, it is appropriate to distinguish between the substantive content of the judgment (*i.e.* the operative part of the decision) and the form of the ruling (*i.e.* a written judgment),\" and \"the written judgment is necessarily 'regarding' the substantive content included therein,\" being \"the substantive content, not the form, which is 'alleged to be in breach' of the BIT.\"343\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 129-131.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 130(a).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 130(a).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 130(b).\n\n263.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimant's interpretation has the effect of excluding from the scope of the Respondent's exception to consent any challenges that question the judgment itself. According to the Respondent, \"[t]here is no logical reason why measures that are the *subject of* a judgment should be excluded from the scope of the dispute resolution clause, while measures that are themselves judgments should be covered.\"344 This interpretation leads to an absurd result and cannot be accepted.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 130(c) (emphasis in original).\n\n264.\n\nAs noted in Section IV.C.3.b *supra*, the Respondent also argues that judicial measures are excluded from the scope of the BIT, which supports Costa Rica's interpretation that Article XII(3)(d) excludes challenges to decisions by Costa Rica's judiciary.\n\n265.\n\nContrary to the Claimant's contentions, the Respondent asserts that its interpretation is consistent with the context of the provision. It is entirely consistent with other provisions of the BIT and with the fact that it does not contain many of the limitations typically found in a fork-in-the-road clause.345 By contrast, according to the Respondent, the Claimant's arguments on context are incoherent:\n\na. The Claimant acknowledges that the BIT contains a special definition of the term \"measure,\" but then proceeds to ignore that definition, asserting that the term is generally understood to encompass judicial measures.346\n\nb. Even if the BIT's definition of \"measure\" should be read to include judicial decisions, it does not follow that judicial breaches must be arbitrable. According to the Respondent, \"[i]t is quite common for investment treaties to provide protection against a wide range of breaches, but to restrict international dispute resolution concerning such measures to a narrower subset.\"347\n\nc. The jurisdictional limitation contained in Article XII(3)(d) cannot be inconsistent with Costa Rica's \"unconditional consent\" to arbitration, as the Claimant suggests, because such \"unconditional consent\" has been given in accordance with the provisions of the entirety of Article XII, which includes the carve-out in Article XII(3)(d).348\n\nd. The fact that Article VIII(1) of the BIT gives investors the opportunity for judicial review of expropriations in Costa Rica is not inconsistent with Costa Rica's interpretation of Article XII(3)(d).349 The BIT does not impose a requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, but if judicial remedies are invoked and result in a judgment, Article XII(3)(d) precludes an investor from bringing another challenge by means of international arbitration.\n\ne. Costa Rica's interpretation is not inconsistent with its substantive obligation to provide FET, insofar as that obligation must be understood to include an obligation not to deny justice in domestic courts. The Claimant confuses the existence of a substantive obligation with the question of which treaty breaches are subject to arbitration. While Costa Rica agrees in principle that the minimum standard of treatment under international law includes a protection against denial of justice, \"Article II(2)(a) of the BIT makes no mention of judicial measures or denial of justice *per se*, meaning that nothing in the particular wording of the clause contradicts Costa Rica's assertion that, under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT, Costa Rican court judgments are not subject to review through arbitration.\"350\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 132.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(a).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(b).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(c).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(d).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 133(e).\n\n266.\n\nWhile the Respondent agrees with the Claimant351 that treaty terms should be interpreted to ensure that each term has meaning (*effet utile*), it views the Claimant's interpretation as lacking *effet utile*. It defies common sense to interpret Article XII(3)(d) as a provision that \"encourages (without requiring) pursuit of local remedies, [\u2026] and shields lower court decisions from arbitral review when a final domestic decision has been rendered,\" as the Claimant contends.352 It is illogical to interpret a provision that prohibits arbitration where a judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court as encouraging the pursuit of local remedies. The provision clearly discourages the pursuit of local remedies. In addition, the Claimant's interpretation would mean that the exception provided under Article XII(3)(d) would be meaningless to Costa Rica, as an investor could always circumvent it by not challenging the lower court decision directly.353\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 127.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 140.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 142.\n\n267.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that, even on the Claimant's interpretation, Article XII(3)(d) would bar a challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision, because the Claimant does not contest that a final domestic decision has been rendered regarding that judgment.354\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 143.\n\n268.\n\nAs to the object and purpose of the treaty, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's suggestion that Article XII(3)(d) must be interpreted restrictively because the object and purpose of the BIT is to promote investment. According to Costa Rica, \"[i]nvestment treaties are *always* intended to promote investment, but this does not mean that exceptions to a Contracting Party's consent to arbitration under such treaties must be read narrowly.\"355 As recognized by multiple courts and tribunals, \"a sovereign State's expression of consent to arbitration must be unambiguous, and that consent cannot be implied or expanded simply by reference to the object and purpose of the treaty.\"356 Indeed, \"numerous BITs promote investment without providing *any* recourse to investment arbitration at all, or by limiting it in ways that are much more severe than the limitations imposed by this BIT.\"357\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 128 (emphasis in original).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 128 citing Exh. **RL-0007**, *Phosphates*, pp. 17-18; Exh. **RL-0068**, *Plama**Consortium Ltd. v.

The Claimant's argument that, under Costa Rica's interpretation, the State could always defeat jurisdiction by launching a challenge of the measure and ensuring that its courts reject that challenge, \"implies the existence of collusion between administrative authorities and the courts to deny an investor its day in court.\"358 In such a scenario, a tribunal may well find that the State is estopped by its own bad faith conduct from invoking an otherwise valid jurisdictional exception. Here, however, there is no suggestion that Costa Rica initiated judicial challenges in bad faith, nor can it be disputed that the Claimant took full advantage of the Costa Rican court system to defend its Concession.359\n\nb. With respect to the Claimant's suggestion that it would be inappropriate to interpret Article XII(3)(d) as precluding arbitration related to judgments in proceedings in which the Claimant did not take part, the Respondent argues that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether the relevant judgment is sufficiently related to the measure being challenged. Here, however, the Respondent notes that the Claimant participated in all the key proceedings in this case, with the exception of those cited by Costa Rica with respect to the 2010 Moratorium. That said, the Respondent insists that these judgments are sufficiently related to the challenged measure as to fall within the scope of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.360\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 135(a).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 135(a).\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 135(b).\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent notes that its interpretation is not based on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* or on other supplementary means of interpretation. It is based on the primary interpretation rules of Article 31 of the VCLT. The Respondent alleges that the *travaux* do not contain much information on the drafting history of Article XII(3)(d), and that the Claimant's suggestion that it was intended as a compromise on the exhaustion of local remedies finds no support in the *travaux*.361 Even if there had been a link between the discussions on exhaustion of local remedies and Article XII(3)(d), it would support Costa Rica's interpretation, as a provision similar to (but broader than) a fork-in-the-road clause. The Respondent argues in this respect that \"[a]n exhaustion of remedies requirement, however, is flatly *inconsistent* with a 'fork-in-the-road' provision, insofar as the first *requires* and the other *prohibits* access to domestic courts before resorting to arbitration;\" \"[i]t is therefore hardly surprising that, [\u2026] following the inclusion of Article XII(3)(d), Costa Rica dropped its earlier proposal to include an exhaustion of remedies requirement.\"362\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 136.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 138 (emphasis in original).\n\n271.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent asserts that the circumstances of the conclusion of the BIT confirm Costa Rica's pride in its legal system and its belief that its system was fully in compliance with international law concerning due process and investor rights. The Respondent notes in this regard that the memorandum accompanying Costa Rica's submission of the BIT for ratification by the legislature concluded that the \"costs of ratifying such BITs were low because they did not provide for a level of protection beyond that already existing under domestic law.\"363\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 139.\n\n(ii) *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimant denies that its claims are barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. None of the measures that it challenges in this arbitration have been the subject of a judgment of a Costa Rican court.364 The Respondent mischaracterizes Infinito's claims as an attack against the 2010 TCA Decision, but this is not Infinito's case.365 Its case is that, as a composite whole, the four measures that it challenges \"had the combined effect of stripping Infinito of all of its rights, barring it from seeking any sort of meaningful remedy, and eliminating any possibility of proceeding with the Crucitas project.\"366\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 156.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 182.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 157.\n\n273.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant alleges that:\n\na. There is no judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.367 The Claimant notes that this decision was made by an appellate court in Costa Rica and is not subject to review by Costa Rican courts. Indeed, part of Infinito's claim is based on the lack of availability of judicial recourse to address the inconsistency created by this decision. As explained further below, the Claimant denies that this decision is a judgment \"regarding\" itself for purposes of Article XII(3)(d). The Claimant also denies that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision was a judgment \"regarding\" the 2011 Administrative Decision; it was a statement by the Constitutional Chamber that it was not empowered to render a judgment regarding the 2010 TCA Decision.\n\nb. There is no judgment regarding the application of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium to the Las Crucitas Project. The court decisions to which Costa Rica refers relate to the application of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium and previous moratorium decrees to other parties and other projects. As explained below, these decisions do not fall under the scope or Article XI I(3)(d).368\n\nc. There is no judgment regarding the 2012 MINAE Resolution. Contrary to Costa Rica's contention, the 2010 TCA Decision cannot be understood to be a judgment \"regarding\" the 2012 MINAE Resolution. While the 2012 MINAE Resolution may be \"regarding\" the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the reverse is not true. But Article XII(3)(d) does not \"bar challenges to administrative measures that were adopted subsequently to judgments and that go further than what those judgments require.\"369\n\nd. Likewise, there is no judgment regarding the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision. This decision, which dismissed Industrias Infinito's unconstitutionality action on admissibility grounds, has never been the subject of any Costa Rican judgment.370\n\n*e.* Finally, the Claimant contends that there is no judgment regarding the composite impact of the individual measures.371\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 231-236.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 237.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 238.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 239.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 240.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, for a claim to be barred under Article XII(3)(d), two conditions must be satisfied: (i) there must be a measure alleged by the Claimant to be in breach of the BIT, and (ii) there must be a judgment regarding that measure.372 The Claimant interprets these conditions as follows, according to the plain meaning of the terms of Article XII(3)(d):\n\na. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) *supra,* the \"measure that is alleged to be in breach\" of the BIT must be the measure that the *Claimant* alleges is in breach of the BIT, not the measure as redefined by the Respondent. Likewise, the \"breach\" that has been alleged must be assessed, at the jurisdictional level, as pleaded by the Claimant.\n\nb. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.b(ii) *supra,* the term \"measure\" includes judgments.\n\nc. The judgment \"regarding\" the measure alleged to be in breach must be an act different from the measure. The term \"regarding\" denotes a connection between the relevant measure and the relevant judgment, which in turn requires at least two discrete entities or acts. To permit the \"judgment\" to be the same act as the \"measure\" would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the term \"regarding.\"373 As a result, a judgment cannot be \"regarding\" itself, as the Respondent maintains.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 159, 164.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 184-185.\n\n275.\n\nAccordingly, under the Claimant's interpretation, judicial measures may be challenged under the BIT, with the following limitations: (i) if a lower court judgment has been challenged by an appeal, it cannot be challenged; and (ii) if the measure is an appellate judgment, the investor may only challenge the final measure in the chain of appeals.374 In this manner, \"Costa Rican courts have the opportunity to reverse the harmful effects of lower court judgments on investments, and to remedy breaches of international law, before a dispute is submitted to arbitration. If the investment is harmed as a result of the final appellate decision, such that the harm becomes final, the investor may challenge the last judgment.\"375\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 20, 160, 165.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 165.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant adds that, if the investor's investment has been harmed by an executive, administrative, or legislative measure, the investor may challenge that measure directly under the BIT. If in turn the measure has been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican court, the investor may challenge that judgment as described in the preceding paragraph.376\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 166.\n\n277.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this interpretation \"reflects the BIT drafters' confidence in Costa Rica's judiciary.\"377 It \"facilitates a robust dispute resolution system that simultaneously respects the independence and sovereignty of the Costa Rican judiciary.\"378\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 21. *See also* C-CM Jur., \u00b6 161.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 21. *See also* C-CM Jur., \u00b6 161.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant insists that Article XII(3)(d) is not a fork-in-the-road provision. It is not designed to make investors choose between domestic and international remedies; rather, it encourages, but does not require, the exhaustion of local remedies.379\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 176.\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its interpretation is consistent with the interpretive principles of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT:\n\na. As explained above, it is consistent with the plain meaning of the terms \"alleged to be in breach\" and \"regarding.\"380\n\nb. It is consistent with the BIT as a whole in light of its context. As explained further below, there is no support in the context of Article XII(3)(d) for the exclusion of judicial measures, or requiring only a tenuous connection between the \"judgment\" and the \"measure.\" Likewise, the Claimant argues that its interpretation is consistent with the remainder of the BIT's provisions.381\n\nc. It is in line with the object and purpose of the BIT, which for the Claimant is the promotion and protection of investments, as stated in the BIT's Preamble.382 Citing *Aguas del Tunari*, the Claimant submits that \"[t]he 'primary objective' of the BIT is to create the framework, and to select [...] 'an independent and neutral forum for the resolution of investment disputes in accordance with a substantive applicable law'.\"383 Its interpretation is further in conformity with the treaty's object and purpose, because it \"preserves investors' rights to submit to international arbitration claims that substantive provisions of the BIT [\u2026] have been breached.\"384\n\nd. Its interpretation facilitates the fulfillment of the object and purpose of the BIT by allowing investors to pursue, without requiring them to exhaust, domestic remedies. The Claimant notes that the \"exhaustion of local remedies is often considered a requirement for an investor to establish that it has experienced a denial of justice at the hands of the host state.\"385 With respect to other claims, it submits that \"the pursuit of local remedies is widely accepted as a desirable, if not necessary, pre-requisite to arbitration, even in the absence of an explicit exhaustion of local remedies requirement in the relevant BIT.\"386 Citing *Generation Ukraine*, *Apotex* and *Loewen*, the Claimant submits that \"[t]o qualify as a final 'measure' under the BIT, an investor must make at least a reasonable effort to obtain local redress.\"387\n\ne. Finally, the Claimant's interpretation is supported by the available supplementary interpretative aids under Article 32 of the VLCT, in particular, by the BIT's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*. The negotiating history of the BIT shows that Costa Rica attempted to introduce an exhaustion of local remedies requirement, but Canada did not accept it. Instead, the parties reached a compromise, reflected in Article XII(3)(d), which encouraged the use of local remedies.388 Only Infinito's interpretation of this provision can be reconciled with this intended purpose.389\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 179-185; C-Rej.

In addition, according to Costa Rica, judicial decisions may never be challenged because they are judgments \"regarding\" themselves.391 Costa Rica also ignores that the \"measure\" affected by the judgment must be the one \"alleged to be in breach.\"392 Costa Rica's interpretation contradicts the plain meaning of these terms,393 as well as the context of Article XII(3)(d):\n\na. \"Read in harmony with the broader context of the BIT, the 'judgment' must be 'regarding' the application of the 'measure' to Infinito before Article XII(3)(d) will be engaged;\" \"[i]t is not enough for there to be a tenuous, immaterial connection or for the judgment to relate to aspects of the measure not directed at Infinito's investments.\"394\n\nb. Citing *Methanex,* where the tribunal was interpreting the phrase \"relating to,\" the Claimant argues that the term \"regarding\" should be \"defined with some form of logical limit, that requires proximity between the investor, measure and judgment.\"395 For a \"judgment\" to be \"regarding\" a \"measure [\u2026] alleged to be in breach,\" it must relate to the investor's allegation as to how that measure breached its rights. Accordingly, \"the judgment must relate to the application of the measure to Infinito or its investments.\"396 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he question is not whether there are any judgments relating to Infinito's claims;\" the question is \"whether there are judgments regarding the measures alleged to be in breach. \"397\n\nc. Nor can a judgment be \"regarding\" itself: as explained above, the term \"regarding\" requires a connection between two discrete entities. The Respondent cannot circumvent this requirement by artificially bifurcating judgments into written reasons and dispositive results: \"[w]hen investors challenge judicial measures, they challenge the 'obligation created by the decree of the court;' the 'measure' *is* the 'judgment.'\"398\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 169.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 168; C-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 193.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 185, 188.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 189.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 190-193, citing Exh. **CL-0148**, *Methanex Corporation v.

Jur., \u00b6 192 (emphasis in original).\n\n282.\n\nCosta Rica's interpretation would also exclude any challenge to a judicial measure, even if the claim is for denial of justice or expropriation.399 According to the Claimant, this is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning and context of Article XII(3)(d), as evidenced by other provisions of the BIT. According to Article I(i) of the BIT, a \"measure\" includes \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,\" which encompasses judicial decisions and processes, as recognized in Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that \"[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions [...],\" and by international tribunals.400 While the ordinary meaning of a term may be supplanted by a special agreed meaning, the party invoking a special meaning must meet a high burden of proof, which the Respondent has failed to meet.401 To the contrary, the list in Article I(i) of the BIT is non-exhaustive (as evidenced by the use of the word \"includes\") and already encompasses judicial measures (which are included in the categories of law, procedure, requirement and practice).402\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 169.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 188, citing Exh. **CL-0007**, International Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts*, II (2) Yearbook of the International Law Commission (2001), Art. 4; Exh. **CL-0075**, *Rumeli*, \u00b6 702; Exh. **RL-0090**, *Saipem*, \u00b6 143; Exh. **CL-0055**, *Loewen*, *Award*, \u00b6 148; Exh. **CL-0014**, *Arif*, \u00b6 334.\n\nC-Rej.

Nor could the investor challenge the court judgment.403 By insulating all judicial measures from review, Costa Rica's interpretation would render many treaty provisions meaningless, including Costa Rica's unconditional consent to arbitration (Article XII(5) of the BIT), the right to seek judicial review of an expropriatory measure (Article VIII(2) of the BIT), Costa Rica's obligation not to deny justice (Article II(2)(a) of the BIT).404 Referring to *Pope & Talbot*, the Claimant argues that \"[t]o exclude all judicial measures from the scope of the BIT would create a 'gaping loophole in international protections' against state conduct that breaches the protections of the BIT.\"405\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 171.\n\nC-CM Jur *.,* \u00b6\u00b6 194-205.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 188, citing Exh. **CL-0072**, *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 26 June 2000 (\"*Pope & Talbot II*\"), \u00b6 99.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent's interpretation would also be inconsistent with the purpose of the BIT. For the Claimant, \"[a]n interpretation that undermines the entire operative force of the treaty frustrates [its] primary objective of facilitating the dispute resolution mechanism deliberately established in the BIT.\"406 Indeed, \"[i]nstead of creating a functional framework for dispute resolution, it would render the substantive protections in the BIT ineffective by allowing Costa Rica to shield its measures from challenge under the BIT in almost every case merely by ensuring that a judgment of a Costa Rican court were adopted 'regarding' any measure that could be the subject of a challenge.\"407\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 208.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 210.\n\n285.\n\nWith respect to the applicability of supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT, the Claimant submits that tribunals may turn to them only when the ordinary meaning, context, object and purpose of a treaty provision leads to a \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\" result; not when the result is illogical, as the Respondent contends. For the Claimant, \"[t]reaty interpreters are not empowered to consider the 'logic' of a provision; rather, Article 32 of the VCLT and the principle of *effet utile* are directed towards avoiding 'manifestly absurd' results,\" *i.e.*, results that \"render[] a provision meaningless or [\u2026] 'untenable as a matter of international law.'\"408 Even then, tribunals cannot ignore the text of the provision; \"they are simply permitted to consider supplementary means of interpretation and to attempt to read treaty provisions in a way that does not render them absurd or strip them of legal effect.\"409\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 184.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 185.\n\n286.\n\nIn particular, Article 32 of the VCLT limits recourse to evidence of the parties' intentions. The Claimant submits that presumed intention is irrelevant; intention will only be relevant if it is derived from the text of the treaty or, if the text leads to ambiguity or absurdity, from acceptable supplementary means of interpretation.410 The Respondent asserts that \"objective evidence\" of the parties' intentions may be considered under appropriate circumstances, but does not define this term.411 Instead, it asks the Tribunal \"to consider its unsupported assertions of what the parties must have thought, without providing any text-based support for its position.\"412 There is no textual support in the BIT or *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* for the Respondent's interpretation of Article XII(3)(d). In particular, the Claimant makes the following submissions:\n\na. As explained above, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* show that Costa Rica insisted on a provision that would require the exhaustion of local remedies. The fact that the drafters previously discussed and removed an exhaustion of local remedies clause does not demonstrate, as Costa Rica now alleges, that Article XII(3)(d) is a fork-in-the-road clause. It is \"nonsensical\" to argue that \"the treaty drafters decided, after months of debating one possible clause, to replace it with an entirely unique clause that had the opposite effect, without any related discussion.\"413\n\nb. Nor is there any evidence in the *travaux* that the parties intended to insulate all judgments from being challenged under the BIT: had the parties intended this result, they presumably would have said so explicitly, for instance by excluding judicial measures from the definition of \"measure.\"414\n\nc. The Claimant also argues that the parties' intentions cannot be discerned from Costa Rica's pride in its judiciary. While the Claimant \"does not dispute that Costa Rica is proud of its judiciary; it challenges the impermissible leap from that pride to Costa Rica's proposed interpretation of Article XII(3)(d), which is made without evidence or justification.\"415\n\nd. The Claimant finally objects to Costa Rica's reliance on an internal memorandum that stated that certain rights enshrined in the BIT were also protected under Costa Rica's constitution.416 This evidence is not probative. Even if it were relevant (*quod non*), it provides no support for Costa Rica's argument, as it refers to the substantive content of Costa Rica's constitution, not the procedure it agreed for international arbitration.417\n\nC-Rej.

Jur., \u00b6 221.\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether Infinito's claims are barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal recalls that the relevant part of the provision reads as follows:\n\nAn investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.418\n\nExh. **C-0001**, Canada-Costa Rica BIT, Art. XII(3)(d).\n\n288.\n\nTo establish the meaning of this provision which is disputed, the Tribunal will apply the rules of interpretation contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. It will thus in good faith assess the ordinary meaning of the terms taken in their context in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT (Article 31). If the interpretation performed in application of these rules leaves the meaning \"ambiguous or obscure\" or leads to a result which is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable,\" the interpreter may resort to supplementary means of interpretation such as the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*. It may also do so to confirm the meaning emerging from the interpretation obtained based on primary means of interpretation (Article 32).\n\n289.\n\nAs noted by the Claimant, two conditions must be satisfied for Article XII(3)(d) to apply: (i) there must be a measure alleged by the claimant to be in breach of the BIT, and (ii) there must be a judgment regarding that measure.\n\n290.\n\nApplying Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal interprets the first condition (i) as meaning the measure pleaded by the Claimant to be in breach of the BIT, considering both the measure and the breach as formulated by the Claimant. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term \"alleged,\" which is used as a verb in this provision and should be considered a synonym to \"pleaded\" or \"claimed.\" It is also consistent with the Tribunal's finding at paragraph 187 *supra* that it must assess the Claimant's case as it has pleaded it. It is recalled that the Claimant has alleged that four measures breach the BIT: (i) the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges annulled Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession; (ii) the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges refused to resolve the conflict between that Chamber's decision and the 2010 TCA Decision; (iii) the 2012 MINAE Resolution, which the Claimant alleges cancelled Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession and extinguished all of its mining rights; and (iv) the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, which the Claimant alleges prevented Industrias Infinito from obtaining a new exploitation concession.\n\n291.\n\nThe measures alleged to be in breach of the BIT must also be \"measures\" within the meaning of Article I(i) of the BIT. The Tribunal has already found at Section XXXXIV.C.3.b(iii) *supra* that judicial decisions are included in Article I(i)'s definition of \"measure.\"\n\n292.\n\nAs a second condition, Article XII(3)(d) requires the existence of a judgment \"regarding\" the measure alleged to be in breach. Relying on the plain meaning and the context of the provision, the Tribunal interprets the term \"regarding\" to refer to a legally relevant connection between two elements, the \"measure\" on the one hand and the \"judgment\" on the other. In the Tribunal's view, not every legally relevant connection will suffice: the judgment must be \"about\" the measure. Stated differently, the measure must be the subject matter (or at least, part of the subject matter) of the judgment. This is consistent with the equally authentic versions of the BIT in Spanish and French. The Spanish version uses the terms \"*relativo a la medida,*\" which, means \"in relation to the measure\" (and not, as the Respondent suggests, \"related to the measure\" - the correct translation of that term would be *\"relacionado a la medida*\"). Likewise, the French version employs the words \"*au sujet de la mesure*,\" which means \"in respect of\" or \"in relation to\" the measure. In other words, the Tribunal considers that the effect of Article XII(3)(d) is to bar claims when the measure in question has already been adjudicated (*i.e.*, subject of a judgment) by a Costa Rican court.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Costa Rica's argument that a measure that is in itself a judgment can be a \"judgment\" about itself for purposes of Article XII(3)(d). As noted above, the use of the word \"regarding\" clearly requires two elements, a measure and a judgment about that measure. Nor does the Tribunal accept Costa Rica's contention that a written judgment can be distinguished from its substantive content (*i.e.* its operative part), the written part being \"regarding\" the substantive content. When a judgment is alleged to be a measure that breaches the BIT, it must be considered in its totality. The act of the State is the judgment in its entirety. While in most cases the alleged breach of international law will derive from the *dispositif*, the latter will be informed by the reasons. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that, for Article XII(3)(d) to be triggered, the measures challenged by the Claimant must have been the subject of a separate judgment by a Costa Rican court. The fact that two of the challenged measures are themselves judgments is insufficient to meet this requirement.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal interprets Article XII(3)(d) as barring claims against acts of the executive or legislative branches of the Costa Rican State (in other words, any non-judicial acts) once there has been a judgment on these acts. It also bars claims against a judicial act if there has been a separate judgment about that first judicial act. In other words, once a judgment has been rendered (be it final or not) on any State act, and that judgment has a direct connection to the investor, an investor cannot bring a claim that the State act breaches the BIT. However, the investor is not barred from alleging that the *judgment* adjudicating on the State act is a breach of the BIT. It is a different question what substantive protections are available against a judgment when the judgment is the measure alleged to be in breach, as compared to the protections available against the underlying State act, but this is a debate that belongs to the merits.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that this leads to an absurd or even illogical result. It is perfectly reasonable for Costa Rica to bar claims against a particular State measure when the measure in question has already been adjudicated by a Costa Rican court. This reflects the BIT Contracting Parties' confidence in the Costa Rican judiciary and a desire for procedural economy. However, it would be contrary to the context of the provision, as well as the object and purpose of the BIT, to exclude claims against the judgment adjudicating the measure. This could void the procedural and substantive protections which the Respondent granted to qualifying investors through the BIT of any meaning, as every measure could potentially be the subject of judicial proceedings in Costa Rica.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that this interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article XII(3)(d) taken in their context in light of the object and purpose of the BIT. It does not find that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* cast a different light.\n\n297.\n\nAfter assessing the record, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has established that no judgment by a Costa Rican court has been rendered \"regarding\" the measures which it alleges to breach the BIT. Specifically, there is no judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. This is a judgment issued by Costa Rica's highest court (the Supreme Court) acting as an appellate court, and it is not subject to review in Costa Rica. Likewise, there is no judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision. To date, there has been no judgment regarding the 2012 MINAE Resolution either. The fact that the resolution implements the 2010 TCA Decision is irrelevant for present purposes. While the 2012 MINAE Resolution may be \"regarding\" the 2010 TCA Decision, there is no judgment \"regarding\" the 2012 MINAE Resolution. Finally, while the Respondent argues that there have been judgments in Costa Rica regarding the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, none of these judgments has a significant connection to the Claimant or to the measure alleged to be in breach.\n\n298.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant's claims are not barred by Article XII(3)(d).\n\n**b. Are Infinito's Claims Time-Barred under Article XII(3)(c)?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Infinito's claims concern measures which are time-barred under the statute of limitations specified in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. Pursuant to this provision, an investor may only submit a claim to arbitration if \"not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\"419 The measures that really caused the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant occurred before the cut-off date for the statute of limitations.\n\nExh. **C-0001**, Canada-Costa Rica BIT, Art. XII(3)(c).\n\n300.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal must address three issues to determine this objection:420\n\na. First, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period.\n\nb. Second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date. The Respondent submits that the \"treaty [\u2026] requires identification of the moment when, for the first time, Infinito knew or should have known that its rights to the Crucitas project had been impaired.\"421 For the Respondent, \"[t]he triggering event is not *certainty* of such impairment;\" [n]or is it relevant whether because of later governmental action, the relevant impairment may have been magnified.\"422 In this respect, the Tribunal must also determine \"when there is an earlier measure along with a later one that confirms, implements, and/or reinstates the earlier one, which one should be considered relevant for purposes of this Clause of the Treaty.\"423 The Respondent submits that \"[t]he Tribunal must objectively determine the relevant facts for purposes of jurisdictional issues, including this one, and it need not accept blindly the Claimant's factual characterizations.\"424\n\nc. Third, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage before the cut-off date. The Respondent emphasizes that the BIT asks when the Claimant *first* acquired knowledge of having incurred loss or damage; it does not require the loss to be complete, final or irreversible.425 Relying on *Mondev* and *Grand River*, the Respondent contends that \"damage or injury may be incurred even though the amount or extent may not become known until some future time.\"426\n\nTr.

As a result, these are the actual breaches for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis, and what matters is the date on which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of these measures and of the loss or damage arising from them.\n\nTr.

The fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was suspended pending the appeal to the Administrative Chamber is irrelevant. NAFTA jurisprudence confirms that \"the limitation period under Article XII(3)(c) 'is not subject to any suspension [\u2026] prolongation or other qualification' and cannot not be tolled by the simple expedient of instituting litigation against the disputed measure.\"434\n\nR-Mem.

Press Release (18 January 2011).\n\n305.\n\nAs to the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, while the Claimant formally challenges the legislative amendment which entered into force on 10 February 2011, the Respondent argues that this measure could not have caused it any damage, because the Claimant was already precluded from obtaining new permits as a result of the 2010 Executive Moratorium, which had been in place since May 2010 and was not abrogated by the 2011 Legislative Moratorium.441\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 196; Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 117:5-118:12 (Mr. Di Rosa).\n\n306.\n\nFurther, Infinito's argument that it was not affected by the 2010 Executive Moratorium, because it was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision that the 2011 Legislative Moratorium had an impact on its investment, is factually and legally flawed. Factually, the Claimant was aware of the loss of its Concession since the date of the 2010 TCA Decision. Legally, it is irrelevant when the Claimant actually became aware of the loss of its Concession; what matters is that it should have known about the existing moratorium, which applied to Infinito from the moment of its enactment.442\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 181-182.\n\n307.\n\nIn response to the argument that the Tribunal must focus on the breaches as alleged by the Claimant, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has no right to tactically plead its case in a way designed to defeat temporal limitations established in a treaty.443 The fact that the BIT refers to an \"alleged\" breach does not mean that the Tribunal must accept the Claimant's characterization of the breaches. The word \"alleged\" is simply used to denote that a breach has not been established; it \"does not imply that, to resolve a jurisdictional issue, such as the applicability of a statute of limitations, a Tribunal may not look beyond what is 'alleged'.\"444 Investment arbitration jurisprudence confirms that it is for the Tribunal, applying an objective standard, to identify the relevant breach, and that \"if [a] claimant was harmed by a particular measure that is outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the claimant cannot overcome the jurisdictional bar merely by pretending that their [ *sic* ] challenge is targeted at a different set of measures.\"445 According to the Respondent, \"[s]ubstance must prevail over form, and tribunals must take care to distinguish between, on the one hand, good faith arguments that a treaty's temporal requirements have been satisfied, and, on the other, abusive attempts to defeat a temporal objection by means of unilateral characterizations and artful pleading.\"446 In support, the Respondent relies in particular on the following cases:\n\na. *Corona,* in which the tribunal held that \"[w]here a 'series of similar and related actions by a respondent state' is at issue, an investor cannot evade the limitations period by basing its claim on 'the most recent transgression in that series.'\"447\n\nb. *Vieira,* where the tribunal found that the dispute predated the relevant treaty because all of the claims derived from the State's denial of a fishing license application before the treaty entered into force. This was despite the claimant's argument that appeals were filed after the treaty had entered into force, and that the fact they had been denied constituted separate violations of the treaty.448\n\nc. *ST-AD,* where an attempt by a claimant to acquire jurisdiction by resubmitting an application that had been denied before it became an investor was rejected by the tribunal: \"a tactic based on the resubmission of an application that has been denied before a claimant becomes an investor after it has acquired such status is unacceptable. It creates an illusion of an event that happened when a protected investor was on the scene. But like all illusions, it is a misleading illusion.\"449\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 163-175.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 164.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 165.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 173.\n\nExh. **CL-0130**, *Corona Materials, LLC v.

The Claimant's reliance on *Tecmed* is misplaced as, contrary to the situation in that case, here the Claimant fully assessed the significance and effects of the 2010 TCA Decision as soon as it was issued.450*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy* is similarly inapposite, as here it is clear that the dispute crystallized on the date of the annulment of Infinito's 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision.451 Nor can the Claimant rely on *Apotex* and *Mondev* for the proposition that, in cases involving judicial decisions, an injury typically does not crystallize until the final decision is rendered: the question under Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT is when Infinito itself first believed that its rights had been violated and that it suffered a loss.452 Indeed, the tribunal in *Apotex* dismissed one of the claims (arising from administrative proceedings) as untimely, and held that a claimant cannot use late court proceedings to toll the earlier limitation period.453 Similarly, the *Mondev* tribunal reasoned that \"[t]he mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed when a treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct,\" a reasoning that should be applied by analogy here.454\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 184, citing Exh. **CL-0085**, *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Relying on *Rusoro*, the Respondent argues that such knowledge is sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations. In that case, the tribunal found that Rusoro's claim was barred under the relevant statute of limitations because the claimant had admitted knowledge of its loss more than three years before bringing the arbitration. In circumstances similar to those here, the tribunal concluded that \"what is required is simply knowledge that loss or damage has been caused, even if the extent and quantification are still unclear.\"457\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 179, citing Exh. **RL-0181**, *Rusoro Mining Ltd. v.

The Respondent's objections, namely that the measures the Claimant is \"really\" challenging are: (i) the 2010 TCA Decision; and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratorium, both of which occurred outside the three-year limitation period provided under Article XII(3)(c), are incorrect and should be rejected. The claims must be assessed as pleaded by the Claimant, and \"[w]hen Article XII(3)(c) is applied to the measures that Infinito alleges breached the BIT, because they resulted in the actual loss of Industrias Infinito's rights associated with the Crucitas project, it is clear that the arbitration commenced within the applicable limitation period.\"458\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 131 (emphasis in original).\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that Article XII(3)(c) bars claims only if three years have elapsed from the time at which the Claimant first acquired or should have first acquired knowledge of: (a) the alleged breach; and (b) the alleged loss or damage sustained. The Claimant acknowledges that \"[i]f actual knowledge cannot be established, constructive knowledge may be imputed to the claimant if a reasonably prudent claimant would have known of the alleged breach and resulting loss.\"459\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 248, citing Exh. **RL-0032**, *Grand River,* \u00b6 66; Exh. **CL-0089**, *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v.

This interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the provision, as required by Article 31 of the VCLT. As discussed in that same section, the word \"alleged\" is not a meaningless qualifier; it denotes that the violations to be addressed are the \"presumed or supposed violations of [the BIT] invoked by the Claimant.\"460 Thus, \"[t]he only relevant question is whether the breach, *as alleged by the claimant*, is time-barred;\" \"[e]ven if a claimant references events that are outside the tribunal's temporal jurisdiction, the claim will not be time-barred if the alleged breach itself is timely.\"461 A respondent cannot reformulate a claim to suggest that it falls outside of the limitation period.462\n\nC-Rej.

Until that time, the annulment of Industrias Infinito's rights was suspended and could still be overturned.. The 2010 TCA Decision could not terminate the process in a definitive manner, nor could it be acted upon by administrative agencies. The Administrative Chamber could also have rendered a decision on the merits without sending it back to the TCA for reconsideration.465 This was acknowledged by the 2012 MINAE Resolution cancelling the 2008 Concession, which stated that the 2010 TCA Decision had been confirmed by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and had thus become firm.466\n\nC-Rej.

Jur., \u00b6 141.\n\n318.\n\nIn any event, relying on FTI's expert report, the Claimant contends that Infinito's investments did not become substantially worthless until after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was rendered. According to the Claimant, \"Infinito's financial statements, market capitalization, management statements and public disclosure, and continuing investment in the Crucitas project after the [2010 TCA Decision] all consistently indicate that it was the Administrative Chamber's decision, not the [2010 TCA Decision], that rendered Infinito's investments substantially worthless. This is confirmed by the actions of the [G]overnment of Costa Rica in appealing the decision, and contemporaneous statements in Costa Rican media.\"470 It was thus on the date of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (30 November 2011) that Infinito first knew that the measures it alleges to have breached the BIT had caused it loss or damage.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 252.\n\n319.\n\nLikewise, the Claimant's claim regarding the open-pit mining moratorium is not time-barred. First, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium did not become applicable to Infinito until the Administrative Chamber finally annulled the 2008 Concession on 30 November 2011. Prior to that final annulment, the Concession remained valid, and Infinito was unaffected by the moratorium.471 According to the Claimant, \"[i]t is irrelevant when the moratorium was implemented, since Infinito is not alleging that the existence of the moratorium independent of its impact on Infinito breached the BIT.\"472 For the Claimant, \"[t]he breach occurred only after the moratorium became capable of affecting Infinito's rights, which could not have happened before the Administrative Chamber finally annulled Industrias Infinito's exploitation concession on November 30, 2011,\" \"[o]nly then could Infinito have known of the moratorium's impact.\"473\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 254.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 254.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 254.\n\n320.\n\nSecond, contrary to what Costa Rica suggests, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium does not merely \"duplicate\" the 2010 Executive Moratorium. According to the Claimant, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium \"subsumed\" earlier moratoriums.474 In any event, Infinito does not challenge the existence of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium in and of itself, but rather the application of that moratorium to the Las Crucitas Project. The moratorium was irrelevant until the Administrative Chamber finally annulled Industrias Infinito's 2008 Concession and other permits on 30 November 2011. As a result, \"the fact that earlier moratoriums existed is irrelevant to the question of when Infinito first learned that a breach had occurred and that it had suffered losses relating to that breach.\"475 In fact, in a May 2010 press release Infinito specifically noted that the 2010 Executive Moratorium did not apply to the Las Crucitas Project because at that time Infinito still held valid rights in the Las Crucitas area, including the 2008 Concession. Infinito had thus no reason to challenge the application of the moratorium before November 2011.476\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 255, citing CER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6\u00b6 330-331.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 255.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 142-143.\n\n321.\n\nFurther, the Claimant highlights that it is also challenging the 2012 MINAE Resolution, which it argues extinguished Infinito's remaining rights over the Las Crucitas Project; and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which declined on preliminary admissibility grounds to hear Infinito's unconstitutionality claim against the 2010 TCA Decision. The Claimant specifies that both of these measures were rendered within the three-year limitation period.477\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 256.\n\n322.\n\nThe Claimant further rejects the Respondent's legal arguments regarding the application of the BIT's statute of limitations. First, there is no merit to Costa Rica's argument that events outside the three-year limitation period cannot be relied upon in establishing a breach of the BIT. Citing *Tecmed*, the Claimant submits that \"[a] tribunal can rely on preceding events, in its analysis, if those events culminated in a breach that was itself timely.\"478 Prior events must not be confused with the measure challenged: \"while 'a dispute may presuppose the existence of some prior situation or fact [...] it does not follow that the dispute arises in regard to the situation or fact.'\"479 Circumstances that pre-date the alleged breach are not barred from the Tribunal's consideration; they \"can provide the necessary background or context for determining whether breaches occurred during the time-eligible period.\"480 Tribunals may also rely on events pre-dating a treaty's entry into force, or pre-dating the moment at which an investor actually acquired an investment, provided that the alleged breach occurred after the treaty entered into force or the investor acquired its investment.481 What matters is that the alleged breach itself is timely. Referring to *Tecmed*, the Claimant argues that \"[t]he limitation period would not run until 'the point of consummation of the conduct encompassing and giving an overarching sense to such acts.'\"482 Relying on *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy*, the Claimant submits that \"the critical date is the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop over a period of time before they finally 'crystallize' in an actual measure affecting the investor's treaty rights.\"483\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 261, citing Exh. **CL-0085**, *Tecmed*, \u00b6 68.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 258, citing Exh. **RL-0032**, *Grand River*, \u00b6 86, quoting *The Electricity Company of* *Sofia v.

According to the Claimant, \"[a]n alleged breach that renders an earlier measure final is still a distinct breach,\" and \"[t]he breach is crystallized with the measure that renders its effects final.\"484 Invoking *Apotex*, the Claimant argues that \"[j]udicial proceedings [\u2026] may form the basis of a timely claim even if they affirm the result of an earlier, time-barred measure.\"485 It adds, relying on *Mondev*, that limitation periods will begin to run only after the issuance of a court decision that finally disposes of the claimant's rights.486 As confirmed in *Corona*, only the final, crystallizing breach may be challenged, and it is that breach that must fall within the limitation period.487\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 262.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 263, citing Exh. **RL-0020,** *Apotex,* \u00b6\u00b6 317, 333-334.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 264, citing Exh. **CL-0062**, *Mondev*, \u00b6\u00b6 70,87.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 268-269.\n\n324.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's assertions, an appellate decision that affirms and renders the judgment of a lower court final can be considered a distinct measure giving rise to a standalone breach.488 The cases on which the Respondent seeks to rely are either distinguishable (*Sistem*) or do not support its case (*Apotex, Feldman, Grand River*). Indeed, in most of these cases, the measure crystallizing the breach pre-dated the tolling of the statute of limitations, and the claimant manufactured a subsequent challenge to the measure despite the fact that no further procedural rights existed under domestic law:489\n\na. In *Sistem,* the question whether an appellate decision amounted to a distinct breach of the treaty did not arise, which makes this case irrelevant to decide that issue.490\n\nb. In *Apotex,* although the tribunal declined jurisdiction over a time-barred measure because the claimant had instituted further litigation to challenge it, it assumed jurisdiction over claims arising from the final appellate court decisions themselves.491 Applying the tribunal's reasoning, a direct claim against the 2010 TCA Decision would be time-barred, but a claim based on the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision would not.492\n\nc. *Feldman* and *Grand River* are inapposite because they stand for the proposition that a limitation period cannot be suspended or prolonged, but here \"Infinito does not require any suspension or prolongation because the breaches *alleged by it* occurred within the three-year limitation period.\"493\n\nd. Contrary to the Respondent's contention, *Mondev* does not suggest that appellate decisions represent a failure to remedy previous breaches rather than new breaches. It rather stands for the proposition that, to be successfully challenged, court decisions must independently give rise to actionable breaches, which the Claimant does not dispute. In fact, the *Mondev* tribunal did assume jurisdiction over challenges to judicial measures.494\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 266, citing Exh. **CL-0075**, *Rumeli*, \u00b6\u00b6 705-706.\n\nC-Rej.

Jur., \u00b6 147, citing Exh. **CL-0062**, *Mondev,* \u00b6\u00b6 75, 87.\n\n325.\n\nHere, all of the measures challenged by Infinito constitute new and distinct breaches. All of them are positive acts by the Costa Rican Government that are distinct from the 2010 TCA Decision and do not fall outside the limitation period:495\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision upheld the 2010 TCA Decision by applying the 2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession and other project approvals, even though it had the power to reverse it, thus rendering final and irreversible the annulment of the Concession and other approvals.\n\nb. The 2012 MINAE Resolution went even further, extinguishing all of Infinito's mining rights, not only those annulled by the Administrative Chamber.\n\nc. Through the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, a different chamber of the Supreme Court refused on procedural grounds to address the 2010 TCA Decision.\n\nd. Finally, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium prevented Infinito from applying for a new concession and other approvals.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 270.\n\n326.\n\nThird, the Claimant denies that the limitation period starts from the date on which Infinito's rights were impaired, even if that impairment was not certain, as the Respondent suggests.496 This interpretation is contrary to the plain meaning of Article XII(3)(c), according to which the limitation period cannot start before the investor has knowledge of the alleged breach. This means that a breach must already have occurred, and any so-called \"impairment\" before that date is irrelevant. Relying on *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy*, the Claimant submits that \"[e]vents that may give rise to later, permanent breaches or which foreshadow potential future breaches are not breaches at all under the BIT.\"497\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 149-154.\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 152-153, relying on Exh. **CL-0158**, *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy*, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 149.\n\n327.\n\nCosta Rica's argument is also contrary to the context of Article XII(3)(c), because certain provisions of the BIT (such as expropriation) can only be triggered by irreversible State action.498 In addition, as explained in Section IV.C.4.a(ii) *supra*, when the measure is a judicial measure, Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT precludes the investor from bringing a claim against a decision that is not final. As explained by counsel for the Claimant during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:\n\nAnd the provision in XII(3)(d), which prevents a measure with respect to which there has been a subsequent Judgment, prevents us from bringing any claim with respect to the TCA decision. So, we're operating very much consistently in our submission with the provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty in respecting the particular provisions that the Parties have agreed to with respect to when a claim can properly be brought in this case.499\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 152, citing Exh. **CL-0075**, *Rumeli,* \u00b6 795, noting that a breach will crystallize only when there is \"an expropriation which ha[s] taken definite and irrevocable effect.\"\n\nTr. Day 1 (ENG), 237:11-20 (Mr. Terry).\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n328.\n\nPursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration only if \"(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\" The Respondent argues that Infinito's claims concern measures that are time-barred pursuant to this provision, and the Claimant denies this.\n\n329.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal defers the consideration of this objection to the merits. In the Tribunal's view, the analysis of this objection requires the analysis of factual and legal issues that are intertwined with the merits.\n\n330.\n\nAs noted by the Respondent, to decide this objection the Tribunal must answer three questions: (i) first, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period; (ii) second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date; and (iii) third, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage before that date.\n\n331.\n\nWith respect to the first question, the Parties agree that the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period is 6 February 2011.\n\n332.\n\nWith respect to the second question, the Tribunal has already determined that it must consider the Claimant's claim as pleaded. This means that it must assess whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the breaches *as alleged by the Claimant* before the cut-off date. The Claimant argues that all of the measures that it is challenging in this arbitration occurred after the cut-off date. However, the Respondent correctly points out that Article XII(3)(c) requires identifying the date on which the Claimant *first* acquired knowledge of the alleged breach, which in the Respondent's view requires identifying the date on which the Claimant first acquired knowledge that its rights had been impaired. In the Respondent's view, the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the impairment of its rights in the Concession with the 2010 TCA Decision. Without accepting this argument at this stage, the Tribunal considers that, to determine when the Claimant first acquired (or should have first acquired) knowledge of a specific breach, it must begin by identifying the date on which the alleged breach crystallized. This requires a substantive review of each of the measures complained of as well as of the measures that the Respondent considers lie at the heart of the Claimant's case (in particular, of the 2010 TCA Decision). This analysis is deeply intertwined with the merits, and the Tribunal will thus conduct it during the merits phase.\n\n333.\n\nThe same applies to the third question. For the Tribunal to determine when the Claimant first acquired (or should have first acquired) knowledge that it had suffered loss or damage, the Tribunal must first identify the loss or damage alleged and the breach from which that loss or damage flows. Here, the Respondent argues that the real cause of the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant are the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2010 Executive Moratorium, not the four measures identified by the Claimant. Accordingly, the Tribunal will need to assess the evidentiary record to determine the loss or damage alleged, its cause, and when the Claimant first acquired knowledge of that loss or damage. In the Tribunal's view, this inquiry will be undertaken more efficiently together with the merits, when the Tribunal will have a full view of the evidentiary record.\n\n334.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal defers this issue to the merits phase.\n\n**c. Are These Jurisdictional Requirements or Conditions for Admissibility?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent has framed its objections under Article XII of the BIT as objections to jurisdiction. The Claimant objects that, while Article XII(2) and (5) of the BIT contains Costa Rica's consent to jurisdiction, Article XII(3) (on which several of the Respondent's objections are premised) sets out the conditions for the admissibility of the claims.500 Specifically, the Claimant submits that:\n\na. In Article XII(5) of the BIT, Costa Rica consents unconditionally to submit disputes under the BIT to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article XII.501\n\nb. The Tribunal's jurisdiction *(i.e.,* \"the power of the tribunal to hear the case\") is defined by Article XII(2) of the BIT. Here, the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article XII(2) are satisfied because \"Infinito (i) is an investor as defined in Article I of the BIT, (ii) claims damages resulting from measures that arose after the BIT came into force, [and] (iii) claims damages arising out of a breach of the BIT for an investment in Costa Rica's territory.\"502\n\nc. By contrast, Article XII(3) sets out admissibility, not jurisdictional, requirements. For the Claimant, admissibility requirements relate to the \"particulars of the claim,\" as opposed to the power of the tribunal to hear the case.503 Here, \"Article XII(3) sets out admissibility requirement[s] because it provides the conditions that an investor must satisfy in order to submit a claim to arbitration.\"504 This is made clear by the opening language of Article XII(3) (\"[a]n investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if [\u2026]\"), and is supported by the fact that on its plain language Article XII(2) is not qualified by or subject to the satisfaction of Article XII(3).505\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 515-521.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 516.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 516.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 516, 519.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 519 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 516.\n\n336.\n\nAs a result, the Claimant argues that Costa Rica may not rely on Article XII(3), or any other provision of Article XII, to vary its consent to arbitration.506 According to the Claimant, the tribunal in *Churchill* rejected a similar attempt by Indonesia to import a legality requirement into the conditions for consent.507\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 518.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 517, citing Exh. **RL-0128**, *Churchill Mining Plc v.

According to Costa Rica, the requirements of Article XII(3) constitute mandatory limits to Costa Rica's consent to arbitration.510 The three-year limitation period and the bar on claims concerning measures already adjudicated by a Costa Rican court \"are not simply hurdles that Claimant must overcome to commence arbitration, such as compulsory prior litigation in municipal courts;\" \"[r]ather, the requirements of Article XII(3) are strict conditions, non-compliance with which renders Claimant's claim non-arbitrable.\"511 There is no basis to assume that these conditions can be relaxed or disregarded, or that any deficiency in that regard can be cured.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 283.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 283.\n\n339.\n\nFor the Respondent, the words \"only if\" used in Article XII(3) \"leave no doubt as to the jurisdictional nature of the provision.\"512 In addition, Costa Rica's \"unconditional consent\" to arbitration in Article XII(5) expressly states that it is given \"in accordance with the provisions of [Article XII].\" Accordingly, it must be understood that this unconditional consent is contingent upon the requirements of Article XII(3) being met.513 Citing the ICJ in the *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo* case, the Respondent submits that when consent to jurisdiction is expressed in a compromissory clause, any conditions to which such consent is subject will constitute limits to jurisdiction, and not conditions for admissibility.514 Citing the ICJ and the decision in *ICS Inspection and Control*, the Respondent argues that consent to jurisdiction must be indisputable and may not be presumed, and that the burden of proof falls on the Claimant.515\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 284.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 284.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 285, citing Exh. **RL-0150**, *Case Concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

In the Claimant's view, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that one of the requirements of Article XII(3) was not met, because those requirements go to the admissibility of the claim and not the Tribunal's jurisdiction, they could be bypassed by the MFN clause found at Article IV of the BIT.\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent has raised two objections grounded on this provision: one based on Article XII(3)(c) and another on Article XII(3)(d). The Tribunal has found that the requirement set out in Article XII(3)(d) is met, so whether this requirement is one of jurisdiction or admissibility is of no consequence. As to the Respondent's objection that the claims are time-barred under Article XII(3)(c), the Tribunal has deferred the consideration of this matter to the merits. As a result, the Tribunal will address the question of whether it is a jurisdictional or admissibility requirement during the merits phase if it becomes relevant, *i.e*., if the Tribunal considers that the requirement has not been met and Costa Rica's objection is sustained.\n\n**5.

Do the Claims Fall under the Exclusion Contained in Annex I, Section III(1)of the BIT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nAnnex I, Section III(1) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n**III. General Exceptions and Exemptions:**\n\n1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.\n\n(i) *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"the judicial, executive and administrative acts challenged in this arbitration are limited to maintenance and enforcement of preexisting environmental measures, and are therefore barred by Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT, taken together with the other jurisdictional limitations of the BIT.\"518\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 201.\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent appears to acknowledge that, as this provision requires measures to be \"otherwise consistent\" with the BIT, it could be argued that this is a matter for the merits. However, the Respondent also contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider whether measures that pre-date 6 February 2011 (*i.e*., the cut-off date for purposes of the statute of limitations) are consistent with the BIT. \"Thus, provided that such measures are motivated by environmental concerns, the language of Article III Annex I prohibits challenges to any State acts that adopt, maintain or enforce such a preexisting environmental measure.\"519\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 199.\n\n347.\n\nAs explained in previous sections, the Respondent submits that the *real* measures being challenged pre-date the cut-off date, while the measures *formally* challenged by the Claimant merely adopt, maintain or enforce these pre-existing measures. As all of these measures (pre-existing or not) were motivated by environmental concerns, the Respondent submits that they are barred by Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT.520\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 199-201.\n\n348.\n\nSpecifically, relying on Dr. Ubico's expert report, the Respondent argues that each of the acts challenged in this arbitration merely maintain and/or enforce pre-existing environmental measures:521\n\na. The 2010 TCA Decision that annulled the 2008 Concession enforced the 2002 Moratorium as well as the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, both of which were dictated by environmental concerns. In addition, the 2010 TCA Decision itself is motivated by environmental concerns, and is therefore also an environmental measure.\n\nb. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision simply maintained the 2010 TCA Decision, essentially preserving the *status quo ante*.\n\nc. The 2012 MINAE Resolution enforced the 2010 TCA Decision, without going beyond it.\n\nd. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium maintained and enforced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, which was already in force under the pre-existing Arias and Chinchilla Moratorium Decrees. According to the Respondent, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium did not go beyond the scope of these decrees.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 200; RER-Ubico 1, \u00b6 139.\n\n(ii) *The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimant denies that its claims are barred by Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT. This provision is not a defense to the Respondent's breaches of the BIT; it only applies to environmental measures that are otherwise consistent with the BIT, and it does not alter or override substantive treaty obligations. This means that the Respondent cannot invoke this provision as a defense in respect of measures that do breach the BIT. As a result, the Claimant submits that \"the provision is irrelevant to the Tribunal's determination of the merits of Infinito's claims.\"522\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 273.\n\n350.\n\nThis interpretation, so says the Claimant, is consistent with the plain meaning of the terms \"otherwise consistent with this Agreement,\" and has been confirmed by commentators and tribunals alike.523 This does not mean that the provision is ineffective or devoid of meaning, as it confirms the State's right to sanction breaches of its environmental laws in a manner that is not otherwise inconsistent with the BIT.524 By contrast, the Respondent's interpretation would render the terms \"otherwise consistent with this Agreement\" meaningless. The Claimant also notes that these terms are not present in other exceptions in Annex I, Section III.525\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 278-281, citing Exh. **CL-0195**, T.

The \"otherwise consistent with this Agreement\" language not only applies to new measures that are \"adopted,\" but also to measures that \"maintain\" or \"enforce\" an earlier measure. In any event, the limitation period is irrelevant because it only bars claims that relate to breaches or losses that became known more than three years before the claim was initiated; it does not bar claims for breaches or losses that became known within that period, even if those breaches are based on a measure that \"adopts\" or \"maintains\" an earlier measure.526\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 284-285.\n\n352.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant denies that the annulment of its Concession and other project approvals were motivated by *bona fide* environmental concerns. The evidence shows that the Claimant's rights were annulled for technical and administrative reasons.527\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 286-292.\n\n353.\n\nIn this respect, relying on *Metalclad*, the Claimant submits that the environmental measures exception contained in Article 1114 of the NAFTA (on which Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT is based) does not apply where the competent authorities of the host State have previously found the project to be environmentally sound,528 as is the case here. Indeed, the Claimant emphasizes that the Las Crucitas Project was determined to be environmentally sound by the appropriate Costa Rican authorities:\n\na. The SETENA, Costa Rica's national body charged with environmental approvals, approved the Environmental Impact Assessments for the Las Crucitas Project and declared the project environmentally viable.529\n\nb. The SINAC, the national system of conservation areas, approved Industrias Infinito's land use change permit allowing it to fell trees.530\n\nc. The SINAC, SETENA and the Attorney-General of Costa Rica defended the Las Crucitas Project's approvals before the Constitutional Chamber, arguing that they were environmentally viable and in conformity with Costa Rica's constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically-balanced environment.531\n\nd. The Constitutional Chamber (which is the court with jurisdiction over environmental protection) rendered a detailed decision \"exhaustively analyzing the Crucitas project's environmental effects and conclusively determining that the project posed no threat to the environment.\"532\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 287, citing Exh. **CL-0058**, *Metalclad*, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98; and Exh. **CL-0167**, *The United* *Mexican States v.

Specifically:533\n\na. The 2002 Moratorium could not represent a real environmental concern considering that the Government repealed it. In fact, as the Administrative Chamber recognized, had the Concession been issued two weeks later there would have been no problem with its validity.\n\nb. Further, the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to projects with acquired rights. Indeed, under the same administration that enacted the 2002 Moratorium, the SETENA approved the EIA for the project.\n\nc. In addition, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was not based on an analysis of environmental soundness. Rather, it relied on a technical analysis of the principle of conversion used to restore the project's Concession. This is confirmed by the fact that the SETENA, the SINAC and the Attorney-General all appealed the 2010 TCA Decision, underlining the project's environmental viability.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 290-291, Exh. **C-0261**, Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011); Exh. **C-0080**, Executive Decree No. 30477-MINAE (12 June 2002), Exh. **C-0247**, File No. 08-1282-1027-CA, Submissions of the State to the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court (18 January 2011).\n\n(iii) *Discussion*\n------------------\n\n355.\n\nBefore undergoing an analysis of this objection, the Tribunal must determine if this is the right moment to address it.\n\n356.\n\nWhile the Respondent seems to acknowledge that issues arising from Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT could be merits issues,534 it maintains that the matter is one of jurisdiction or possibly admissibility, or at the very least a threshold inquiry. As the Respondent explained during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:\n\nSo, you can call it jurisdictional, you can call it admissibility or anything else, but it's a threshold inquiry that disposes of the claim because if nothing in the BIT can be construed to prevent Costa Rica from doing it, then there is nothing to talk about.535\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 199.\n\nTr. Day 1 (ENG), 162:17-20 (Mr. Evseev).\n\n357.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimant's position appears to be that the issues raised by Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT are for the merits. Indeed, its primary position is that this provision is irrelevant.536 However, relying on the *Tamimi* case, it appears to acknowledge that if the issue is brought up at all, it should be dealt with at the merits stage.537\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 273.\n\nTr. Day 1 (ENG), 326:8-327:9 (Mr. Lax).\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that any objection by the Respondent based on Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT is a matter for the merits. As is obvious from its plain language quoted above, this provision sets out guidelines regarding the content of measures that may be adopted, maintained or enforced by the host State. It does not relate to the State's consent to arbitrate, nor to whether a claim can be heard or not; it relates to whether a particular measure has or has not breached the BIT. Accordingly, it cannot be deemed a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility; it must properly be regarded as a matter for the merits.\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal thus defers this question to the merits stage.\n\n**6. Can Infinito Invoke the BIT's MFN Clause?**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nAs discussed above, the Claimant argues that all of the preconditions set out in Article XII(3) of the BIT have been met.538 In the alternative, it submits that these preconditions are not applicable by operation of the MFN clause in Article IV of the BIT, and that as a result Infinito is entitled to benefit from the more favorable absence of preconditions in Costa Rica's bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and Korea.539 The Respondent denies that the Claimant can rely on the MFN clause of the BIT to circumvent the BIT's jurisdictional limitations or expand the scope of Costa Rica's consent to arbitration.540\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 231-236.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 237-244; C-CM. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 486-531; C-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 374-407.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 324-358; R-Rej. Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 278-331.\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the preconditions set out in Article XII(3)(a), (b) and (d) are met. It can thus dispense with reviewing the Claimant's alternative argument in respect of these preconditions.\n\n362.\n\nAs to the precondition set out in Article XII(3)(c) (*i.e.*, whether the claims are time-barred), the Tribunal has deferred this issue to the merits. It will thus address the Claimant's MFN argument and the Respondent's related objections at the merits stage, if necessary.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal defers its analysis of the Parties' cost submissions to the merits phase.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n364.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\na. Joins to the merits phase the Respondent's jurisdictional objections under Article XII(3)(c); under Annex I, Section III(1); and under Article IV of the BIT; as well as the determination of whether the Claimant's investment complies with Article I(g) of the BIT.\n\nb. Denies the Respondent's other preliminary objections.\n\nc. Declares that it will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings toward the merits phase by way of a procedural order to be issued after consultation with the Parties.\n\nd.

I specify that I do not disagree with the overall solution given to the case, but it is impossible for me to subscribe to some of the analyses and reasonings, especially when they involve public international law interpretation. As stated by Lao-Tseu, \u201c*le but n'est pas seulement le but, mais le chemin qui y conduit*\u201d (\u201cthe aim is not only the goal but the way to it\u201d). In a nutshell, I would have reached the same overall conclusion to the dispute, but through significantly different avenues. Although it might appear superfluous, as **I agree with the final outcome of the case**, I feel important to describe these avenues.\n\n2.\n\nMy main disagreement concerns the existence of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*: in my view, according to the statute of limitations included in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims presented by Infinito. Of course, my comments could thus have stopped at that point since, without jurisdiction, there is no need to deal with the merits. However, as the majority of the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction and dealt with the merits, I consider it as my Arbitrator's duty to point \u2013 briefly \u2013 to what I analyze as misinterpretations in the application of public international law to the interpretation of the standard of FET in the BIT between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica.\n\n**I. JURISDICTION: APPLICATION OF THE TIME BAR PROVISION IN ARTICLE XII(3)(C) BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe central jurisdictional question,1 on which this Opinion will concentrate is whether the claims of Infinito were time-barred or not.\n\nAnother objection was that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis*, because the Claimant's investment was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rica's laws as required by Article I(g) of the BIT. I will just signal here that, although there are some ambiguities in the Award on what exactly was the Claimant's investment, I agree with the approach found in \u00a7\u00a7 177 and 178 of the Award: \u201c177. The Respondent has not disputed that the Claimant owns or controls its shares in Industrias Infinito in accordance with Costa Rican law. Nor has it argued that the Claimant acquired these shares illegally, or that its ownership or control of these shares has been vitiated in any way [\u2026]. 178. There being no dispute that the Claimant has made an indirect investment in Costa Rica (*i.e.*, its shares in Industrias Infinito) in accordance with its laws, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's illega lity objection. [\u2026]\u201d\n\n4.\n\nAt the outset, it can be mentioned that there is no disagreement, between the Parties, that the cut-off date is 6 February 2011, as acknowledged in the Award:\n\nAs discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Request for Arbitration was filed on 6 February 2014. Hence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims regarding which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach and loss more than three years earlier, *i.e*. before **6 February 2011**. The Parties agree with this cut-off date.2\n\nAward, \u00a7 219. (Emphasis in the Award).\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant invokes five measures \u2013 adopted after the cut-off date \u2013 which it considers to be in breach of the BIT, as is summarized in \u00a7 224 of the Award:\n\nThe Claimant argues that the breaches of the Treaty occurred through five measures, which post-date the cut-off date [\u2026]:\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision dated 30 November 2011 [\u2026]\n\nb. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban on open-pit mining, which entered into force on 10 February 2011 [\u2026]\n\nc. The 2012 MINAET Resolution dated 9 January 2012 [\u2026]\n\nd. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision dated 19 June 2013 [\u2026]\n\ne. The reinitiation of the TCA proceedings for environmental damage in January 2019.\n\n6.\n\nIts argumentation however is centered on the main breach that has to be taken into account for the application of the statute of limitations, *i.e*., **the Administrative Chamber Decision**,3 dated 30 November 2011, that is after the cut-off date.\n\nSupreme Court, Administrative Chamber, Decision (confirming the TCA Decision), 30 November 2011, **C-261**.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the measure that allegedly deprived Infinito of its investment in violation of the BIT is the **TCA Decision**, which was rendered as an oral ruling on 24 November 2010, and a written ruling on 14 December 2010,4 that is before the cut-off date.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (cancelling exploitation concession and approvals), Judgment 4399-2010, 14 December 2010, **C-239**.\n\n8.\n\nThis Opinion will concentrate on the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, as it is, according to the Claimant, the measure that deprived Industrias Infinito of the 2008 Concession.\n\n9.\n\nIn order to go step by step, I will first define precisely the scope of the disagreement between my colleagues and myself, next consider the general approach based on law and doctrine relating to the timing of a breach, which, I believe, supports my position, before engaging in a factual approach dealing with the specific circumstances of this case, mainly scrutinizing the behavior of both Parties, over the relevant time period.\n\n**A. T****he** **S****cope of the** **D****isagreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nAs a reminder, Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT provides, in relevant part:\n\nAn investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if: [\u2026] not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor **first acquired**, or should have **first** acquired, **knowledge** of the alleged **breach** and knowledge that the investor has incurred **loss** or damage [\u2026]. (Emphasis added)\n\n11.\n\nI consider that the majority instead applied the following provision, a kind of Article XII(3)(c) bis:\n\nAn investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if: [\u2026] not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor **finally acquired**, or should have **finally** acquired, **knowledge** of the alleged **breach** and knowledge that the investor has incurred **a complete \u2013 substantial and permanent**5 **\u2013 loss** or damage.\n\nThis point was insisted upon by the majority in the analysis of expropriation, but seems to have been implicitly admitted also for the other violations.\n\n12.\n\nTo me, it is evident, as I will elaborate on below, that the first knowledge both of a breach and of a loss occurred with the TCA Decision.\n\n13.\n\nConcerning the time when the breach occurred, I really have a difficulty with the Award's approach, which has been summarized in its \u00a7 236:\n\nHence, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the first step in the analysis is to identify when a given act or omission was performed or **completed**. The second step is to assess when the Claimant **first knew of the completion of the action** or omission and of the loss caused thereby. This analysis must be conducted for each of the standards allegedly breached [\u2026]. (Emphasis added)\n\n14.\n\nI think that to look at the first knowledge of a breach and loss is in conformity with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT, as Article XII(3)(c) refers to \u201cthe date on which the investor **first acquired**, or should have first acquired, **knowledge** of the alleged **breach** and knowledge that the investor has incurred **loss** or damage.\u201d I do not really understand how first knowledge has been metamorphosed in **first knowledge of a completed breach, which disguises in fact final knowledge**, which I do not consider to be in conformity with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT of the text of Article XII(3)(c). The Article refers to the date when an investor **first** acquired knowledge of a breach and loss not when the existence of the breach and loss was **finally** ascertained and known.\n\n15.\n\nIn fact, the Award mentions numerous times6 that the Administrative Chamber Decision **confirmed** the TCA Decision. When an act confirms another act, **it means that the content of the first act has to be considered as existing since the date it was adopted**. In the same vein, the Award refers multiple times7 to a **completed act** \u2013 brought about by the Administrative Chamber Decision \u2013 to circumvent the requirement that the relevant date is the date of the **first act \u2013** the TCA Decision. The idea underlying the majority's approach must be that something was missing to the TCA Decision and that it had to be completed, *i.e.,* that an additional element was needed for the act to exist. However, the Administrative Chamber Decision **did not itself produce any new breach** of which the Claimant complains. The situation was just that **the** ***status quo*** **remained as it was** after the TCA Decision. The simplest proof of this is the fact that, even if the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision would never have been issued, the concession rights would still be null and void by virtue of the 2010 TCA Decision. The only thing that the Administrative Chamber Decision did was to **confirm an earlier breach**, or if said differently, to refuse to cure the earlier breach, that earlier breach being already known to the Claimant.\n\nAward, \u00a7\u00a7 137, 142, 224(a), 382(a), 416(a), 496, 501, 546 (two times), 565, 580, 708, 710.\n\nAward, \u00a7\u00a7 232 (4 times), 233 (2 times), 235 (two times), 236, 239, 253, 254.\n\n16.\n\nThe Award's approach, as just summarized, is based on the idea that the TCA Decision was not a breach, and on the analysis according to which the breach only occurred, as a final breach, with the Administrative Chamber Decision.\n\n17.\n\nI wonder how this analysis can be reconciled with the principle that a breach of international law occurs at the moment when the act or acts of the State cease to be in conformity with the obligations which are alleged to be violated.8 **The Award's position implies that the TCA Decision annulling the concession was in conformity with Costa Rica's international obligations, while suddenly the Administrative Chamber Decision \u2013 which did not modify the** ***status quo*** **\u2013 was not in conformity with Costa Rica's international obligations**.\n\nSee Article 12 of the ILC Articles on the International Responsibility of States (**CL-007**):  \nArticle 12. Existence of a breach of an international obligation  \nThere is a breach of an international obligation by a State when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, regardless of its origin or character.\n\n18.\n\nConcerning the time when the loss that resulted from the breach occurred, looking first at the claim of expropriation, the majority insisted that the loss has to be permanent and substantial, and that this only occurred with the Administrative Chamber Decision. The majority considered that:\n\n[T]he deprivation of the Claimant's investment only became a **permanent** loss with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. Indeed, it is only with this judgment that the 2010 TCA Decision became **final (*****firme*****)**.9\n\n[\u2026]\n\n[T]he facts on record about the financial effects of the 2010 TCA Decision show that the Claimant did not suffer a **substantial deprivation** of its investment (a requirement for an indirect expropriation to occur) until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.10\n\nAward, \u00a7 239. (Emphasis a dded)\n\nAward, \u00a7 242. (Emphasis a dded)\n\n19.\n\nHowever, it is easy to understand that, assuming there would have been no Administrative Chamber Decision, the result of the TCA Decision was exactly the same: a permanent and substantial loss. It is well known that the loss was already quite severe, after the TCA Decision, but it was also known to be **virtually substantial and permanent, it nothing changed**. The fact that the complete drop in value only materialized after the Administrative Chamber Decision is readily understandable, by the hope of Infinito to see the TCA Decision be set aside. But in the absence of such reversal, the **substantial and permanent loss was already there, inherent in the TCA Decision**.\n\n20.\n\nI would also like to deal with the argument that the TCA Decision was suspended during the cassation proceedings. A suspension does not annul the suspended judgment, **which still exists**, it has just as a consequence that it cannot provisionally be enforced.\n\n21.\n\nIn other words, I consider that **the alleged breach is the TCA Decision**. When a court annuls a concession, it is difficult for me to say that this was not a breach entailing losses. If no cassation proceedings would have been commenced, the breach would still be existing. In this case, **a cassation proceeding was commenced before the cut-off date, which is an undeniable recognition that there was a breach (and losses) before the cut-off date**, although the investor wanted to overturn it. The TCA Decision is alleged to have breached the investor's rights. As cassation proceedings were commenced, the breach still existed, until it was either confirmed (which would be a final knowledge of the breach and not a first knowledge of the breach) or overturned (which means that there is no longer a breach and therefore no necessity to apply the statute of limitations to a useless arbitration, the national courts having solved the problem).\n\n22.\n\n**The breach occurred in 2010**, before the cut-off date. The only thing that was not known is whether this breach would remain as it was or whether the national courts would remedy the breach.\n\n23.\n\nThe TCA Decision is undoubtedly the **first** step to which the other acts complained of do not add anything. They only did not cancel this **first** act. Four of the acts complained of by the Respondent are linked with the TCA Decision.\n\n24.\n\nIf the TCA Decision would not have been the first breach, the other decisions of the courts and administrative organs would not have existed. **The TCA Decision is the root of all the subsequent events**: (1) the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision upheld the 2010 TCA Decision; (2) the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision denied a separate challenge on constitutional grounds against the 2010 TCA Decision; (3) the 2012 MINAET Resolution enforced the 2010 TCA Decision in its order to cancel Industrias Infinito's concession and remove it from the Mining Registry; (4) even the reopening of the proceedings for environmental damages was linked with the TCA Decision.\n\n25.\n\nIf the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision had not been issued, the 2008 Concession, which was annulled before the cut-off date by the TCA Decision, would have remained annulled.\n\n26.\n\nSome last general remarks might be in order.\n\n27.\n\nFirst, it is well known that access to international arbitration does not require \u2013 unless it is specifically foreseen \u2013 the exhaustion of local remedies. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention is quite clear in this respect:\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\n\n28.\n\nThere is no requirement of an exhaustion of local remedies in the BIT. In deciding that the breach only occurred when the final decision of the Supreme Court was adopted, **the majority reintroduces in the arbitration process a condition of exhaustion of the local remedies that was not agreed between the Contracting Parties of the BIT**.\n\n29.\n\nSecond, the majority takes comfort with the solution to which it has arrived at, in stating the following:\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the *raison d'\u00eatre* of a statute of limitations, which is to promote legal certainty by avoiding that claimants delay bringing their claims. This being so, for the statute of limitations to start running, the claimant must be legally in a position to bring a claim. If a claim cannot be brought for legal reasons (for instance, because the claim is not ripe), it would be fundamentally unfair to find that the statute of limitations has started to run. Such a finding may entail that, in some instances, a claimant/investor would have less time to initiate its claim than the statute of limitations. In exceptional situations, that finding might even mean that the claimant/investor has no time left at all to start proceedings, which would effectively result in a denial of justice \u2013 an outcome that cannot reflect the meaning of the Treaty.11\n\nAward, \u00a7 247.\n\n30.\n\nBut, I consider this reasoning entirely circular and again based on the idea that no breach occurs before the local remedies have been exhausted, suggesting that before such exhaustion the claim is not ripe. It can also be mentioned that, in the specific case, the Claimant had until 5 February 2014 to file a claim, if my analysis is applied, which is a little more than 26 months after the Decision which the majority considers to be the breach. In other words, the fear mentioned by the majority that the finding that the first knowledge of a breach might prevent a claimant to bring a claim, if it waits for the final knowledge, does not exist in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n**B. T****he** **G****eneral** **A****pproach**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Case Law in Support of the Arbitrator's Analysis**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThere are many cases applying a similar analysis, which can be cited here, although, as often, there are also cases adopting a different point of view. The question of the cut-off date or critical date can arise in different contexts: the existence of a statute of limitations like in the present case, referring expressly to a first knowledge, the existence of a dispute before a treaty enters into force, the existence of facts pre-dating and facts post-dating the making of an investment.\n\n32.\n\nIn *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*,12 the tribunal cited with approval a submission of the United States, as *amicus curiae*, in the case of *Grand River v. USA*, relating to a similar statute of limitations, stating that \u201c[w]here a 'series of similar and related actions by a respondent state' is at issue, an investor cannot evade the limitations period by basing its claim on 'the most recent transgression in that series'.\u201d13 In that case, there was an act of the State authorities which was the refusal of a license which occurred before the cut-off date, and a refusal to reconsider this decision which occurred after the cut-off date. The tribunal clearly indicated that the refusal was the first act and the fact that it was not overturned did not change the analysis:\n\nIn this context, the Respondent's failure to reconsider the refusal to grant the license is nothing but an **implicit confirmation of its previous decision**. [\u2026]\n\n[\u2026] DR's failure to respond to the Claimant's Motion for Reconsideration was understood by the Claimant itself at that time as not producing any separate effects on its investment other than those that were already produced by the initial decision.14\n\nThe relevant article of DR-CAFTA was similar to the one in the present case:  \nArticle 10.18: Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party  \n1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant **first** acquired, or should have **first** acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage. (Emphasis a dded)\n\n*Corona Materials LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award, 31 May 2016, \u00a7 215, **CL-130**.\n\n*Corona Materials LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award, 31 May 2016, \u00a7 211-212, **CL-130**. (Emphasis added)\n\n33.\n\nIn the same way, it can be said that, in the present case, the Administrative Chamber Decision was an **explicit confirmation** of the previous Decision of the TCA.\n\n34.\n\nIn *Spence v. Costa Rica*,15 the statute of limitations had the exact same wording than in Article XII(3)(c) of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT, and the tribunal considered that the relevant date for jurisdictional purposes was the first knowledge of a breach and not the subsequent confirmation of the breach. It is worth quoting extensive extracts of the award, as it presents things quite clearly:\n\n162. The Claimants face formidable jurisdictional hurdles. On the face of it, the conduct of which they complain has deep roots in the period before the CAFTA entered into force between Costa Rica and the United States on 1 January 2009. [\u2026]\n\n163. [\u2026] If the Claimants cannot establish, to an objective standard, that they first acquired knowledge of the breaches and losses that they allege in the period after 10 June 2010, they fall at the first hurdle. To surmount this obstacle, each claimant must show, in respect of each property claim, that they have a cause of action, **a distinct and legally significant event that is capable of founding a claim in its own right**, of which they first became aware in the period after 10 June 2010. If they can establish this, a further jurisdictional question arises, namely, **whether, in the circumstances of each claim presented, that post-critical limitation date cause of action can be sufficiently detached from acts or facts that pre-date the CAFTA's entry into force on 1 January 2009 so as to be independently justiciable**, even if it may be appropriate still to have regard to pre-1 January 2009 conduct and developments for purposes of determining whether there was a subsequent breach of a CAFTA obligation.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n210. On the issue of first knowledge of the breach, if a claim is to be justiciable for purposes of CAFTA Article 10.18.1, the Tribunal considers that it must rest on a breach that gives rise to a self-standing cause of action in respect of which the claimant first acquired knowledge within the limitation period.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n213. On the issue of whether loss or damage must be crystallised, and whether the claimant must have a concrete appreciation of the quantum of that loss or damage, the Tribunal agrees with the approach adopted in *Mondev*, *Grand River*, *Clayton* and *Corona Materials* that **the limitation clause does not require full or precise knowledge of the loss or damage**. Indeed, in the Tribunal's view, the Article 10.18.1 requirement, *inter alia*, to point to the date on which the claimant *first* acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the loss or damage incurred in consequence of the breach implies that **such knowledge is triggered by the first appreciation that loss or damage will be (or has been) incurred**. It neither requires nor permits a claimant to wait and see the full extent of the loss or damage that will or may result. It is the first appreciation of loss or damage in consequence of a breach that starts the limitation clock ticking.16 (Emphasis in bold added, in italics in the original)\n\n*Aaron C.

(Emphasis a dded)\n\n35.\n\nAnother award is worth mentioning, as it deals with the existence of a loss due to a breach, just discussed in the last paragraph of the citation in *Spence*. In *Rusoro v. Venezuela*, the tribunal found that Rusoro's claim based on measures adopted in 2009 was barred under the relevant statute of limitations, because the claimant had admitted knowledge of its loss more than three years before bringing the arbitration. In circumstances similar to those here, the tribunal concluded that \u201cwhat is required is simple knowledge that loss or damage has been caused, **even if the extent and quantification are still unclear**.\u201d17\n\n*Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Awa rd, 22 August 2016, \u00a7 217, **RL-181**. (Emphasis a dded)\n\n36.\n\nAlso, in *Vieira v. Chile,*18 the tribunal found that the dispute predated the relevant treaty because all of the claims derived from the State's denial of a fishing license application before the treaty entered into force. This solution was adopted despite the claimant's argument that appeals were filed after the treaty had entered into force and that the fact they had been denied constituted separate violations of the treaty.19\n\n[\u2026] *Sostener lo contrario se traducir\u00eda en permitir que en la generalidad de los casos un demandante eluda las restricciones ratione temporis establecidas en cualquier Acuerdo de Promoci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n Rec\u00edproca de Inversiones, planteando en un momento posterior a la fecha de vigencia del correspondiente tratado una nueva reclamaci\u00f3n para luego sostener que la respuesta negativa ante dicha reclamaci\u00f3n constituye un hecho il\u00edcito que da lugar a una nueva controversia, situaci\u00f3n que este tribunal estima contraria a la intenci\u00f3n de las partes pactada en el art\u00edculo 2 del ACUERDO*.  \n[\u2026] To find the opposite would mean to allow a claimant generally to elude *ratione temporis* restrictions established in any Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments [by] submitting a new claim after the relevant treaty's entry into force in order to later argue that the denial of such claim constitutes a violation that gives rise to a new dispute, a situation which this tribunal considers would be contrary to the intention of the parties agreed in Article 2 of the Agreement.\n\nAgreement Between the Republic of Chile and the Kingdom of Spain for the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments, entered into force on 29 March 1994, Article 2(3): El Tratado \u201c[n]*o se aplicar\u00e1, sin embargo, a las controversias o reclamaciones surgidas o resueltas con anterioridad a su entrada en vigor*.\u201d [\u201cshall not apply, however, to disputes or claims arising or resolved prior to its entry into force.\u201d] (Free translation). Although this rule is different than the one at stake in the present case, the issue is the same *i.e.,* when a dispute relating to a breach arises, whether with a first decision denying a license or a subsequent decision refusing to overturn that decision.\n\n*Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/7, Award, 21 August 2007, \u00a7 274, **RL-162**.\n\n37.\n\nAlso, in *ST-AD v. Bulgaria*, some acts of the respondent occurred before the investor made its investment and some after. An attempt by a claimant to acquire jurisdiction by resubmitting an application that had been denied before it became an investor was rejected by the tribunal:\n\nIn fact, that is the only possible relevant event that happened after the critical date of May 25, 2006, when the Claimant became a protected investor under the BIT, *i.e.*, the second set aside application and its rejection by the Supreme Cassation Court [\u2026].20\n\n*ST-AD GmbH (Germany) v. Republic of Bulgaria*, PCA Case No. 2011-06, Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July 2013, \u00a7 316, **RL-075**.\n\n38.\n\nAnd the tribunal added, in order to make things perfectly clear:\n\n[A] tactic based on the resubmission of an application that has been denied before a claimant becomes an investor after it has acquired such status is unacceptable. It creates an illusion of an event that happened when a protected investor was on the scene. But like all illusions, it is a misleading illusion.21\n\n*ST-AD GmbH (Germany) v. Republic of Bulgaria*, PCA Case No. 2011-06, Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July 2013, \u00a7 317, **RL-075**.\n\n39.\n\nFinally, in *EuroGas v. Slovak Republic*,22 the same reasoning as the one presented in this Separate Opinion was presented:\n\n455. This chart illustrates the fact that the situation was exactly the same on 3 May 2005, before the BIT entered into force, and 1 August 2012, after the BIT entered into force: the mining rights that were lost by Rozmin were reassigned to another company. In other words, the mining rights were taken from Rozmin in 2005, allegedly in violation of Belmont's rights under the Canada-Slovakia BIT and international law, and several decisions of the mining authorities (not the judicial authorities) refused to restitute the rights to Rozmin. The decision of the DMO, on 30 March 2012, to reassign exclusive rights over the Mining Area to VSK Mining, and its confirmation by the MMO on 1 August 2012, **did not change Belmont's legal and factual situation**: since the reassignment of the Mining Area in 2005, it had lost its rights on the Mining Area and was not present on the site.\n\n456. Contrary to Belmont's position, the decisions of 30 March 2012 and 1 August 2012 cannot be considered the source of a new dispute; rather, they were **a refusal to resolve the ongoing dispute**, which arose from the alleged breach in 2005.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n459. The State Parties to the Canada-Slovakia BIT cannot have intended that Article 15(6) be read and applied in a way that exposes them to claims from investors that could date from more than three years before the entry into force of the treaty, just because a certain dispute was not settled and/or might give rise to a follow-up action. **Considering that the State's refusal to overturn an existing alleged breach gives rise to a new dispute would open the floodgates to a possible complete disregard of the condition** ***ratione temporis*** **of the application of a BIT.** The consequence would be that an investor could bypass the *ratione temporis* limitations of a treaty by commencing local court proceedings after the entry into force of the treaty, in respect of an old dispute. This cannot be a sensible legal result.\n\n460. The Tribunal does not accept that an investor may invoke the last event in a series of related or similar actions by the State to claim the benefit of the treaty. In the present case, the situation is clear-cut since there has not been a series of (alleged) transgressions by the Respondent, but **one (alleged) transgression whose effects have been maintained throughout domestic court proceedings and repeated decisions by the mining authorities**.

Kyrgyz Republic*,23 where the tribunal did hold that, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d the judicial taking of the claimant's hotel **took place at the date of a lower court judgment** invalidating the underlying contract. What remained was a \u201c**chance of restoration**\u201d of the taken right, later extinguished by the highest appellate instance.

The Permanent Court of International Justice has considered that, when faced with an act and a refusal to overturn the act, the relevant element for analysing jurisdiction is the initial act. In the *Phosphates in Morocco* case, it considered that, as here, the alleged breach of the Italian investor's rights by the French authorities refusing to overturn a former decision fell outside the Court's jurisdiction.24 Like Infinito in the present case, Italy argued that the \u201cviolation only became definitive\u201d when the investor sought and was refused redress by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The PCIJ denied Italy's claim on the ground that the subsequent refusal to redress the prior wrong\n\nmerely results in allowing the [allegedly] unlawful act to subsist. **It exercises no influence either on the accomplishment of the act or on the responsibility ensuing from it**.

France),* PCIJ Series A/B Fascicule No. 74, Decision on Preliminary Objections, 14 June 1938, p. 21, **RL-007**.\n\n43.\n\nThe Court held that the claim concerning the alleged breach was precluded *ratione temporis*.\n\n**2. Doctrine in Support of the Arbitrator's Analysis**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe International Law Commission, ILC, is a well-regarded actor of international law. Professor James Crawford, Special Rapporteur, ILC, discussed the situation in which there is an exhaustion of local remedies. He made it clear that two situations can occur: either the last decision is by itself a violation (for example a denial of justice), or it only confirms the initial wrongful act. In that later case, absent an additional internationally wrongful act by the local courts providing the local remedy against the breach, \u201c**the local remedy is a failed cure, not part of the illness** [\u2026].\u201d25 (Emphasis added)\n\nSecond Report on State Responsibility by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur, 1st Sess., U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/498 (1999), \u00a7 140, **RL-034**.\n\n45.\n\nProfessor Crawford added that:\n\n[T]he breach of international law occurs at the time when the treatment occurs. **The breach is not postponed to a later date when local remedies are exhausted** [\u2026].26 (Emphasis added)\n\nSecond Report on State Responsibility by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur, 1st Sess., U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/498 (1999), \u00a7 145, **RL-034**.\n\n46.\n\nOthers have adopted the same position, among them the Swiss academic, Eric Wyler.27\n\nEric Wyler, \u201c*Quelques r\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9alisation dans le temps du fait internationalement illicite*,\u201d RGDIP, vol. 95, No. 4, 1991, pp. 881\u2013914.\n\n47.\n\nThe general approach relating to the timing of a breach having been clarified, I will now examine carefully how the behavior of the Parties in the circumstances of the case should be analyzed within this framework.\n\n**C. T****he** **F****actual** **A****pproach**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nTo understand the facts and circumstances of this case, the positions of the Parties in the arbitration, but may be more importantly, the positions of the Parties at the time of the disputed events, have to be scrutinized.\n\n49.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Respondent argues that the cancelation of the 2008 Concession was enacted by the TCA Decision adopted before the cut-off date, a circumstance which deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over Infinito's claims; while the Claimant contends that the annulment was enacted by the Administrative Chamber Decision, after the cut-off date, giving thus jurisdiction to this Tribunal to deal with its claims.\n\n50.\n\nIt is my view that the Claimant assigned a role for the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, for the purpose of this arbitration, in order to be able to assert jurisdiction. I find that such a reconstruction of what happened does not fit with the facts of the case, especially with the behavior of the Parties as both the Claimant and the State authorities always considered at the time of the events \u2013 before the launch of the arbitration \u2013 that the breach was caused by the TCA Decision.\n\n51.\n\nI will now give some concrete elements to support this last statement, which I consider quite important.\n\n**1. The Summary of the Positions of the Parties in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nIn fact, the mere reading of the summaries of the positions of the Parties, as presented in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction shows that the Respondent relies \u2013 rightly \u2013 on the **first** knowledge, while the Claimant relies \u2013 wrongly \u2013 on the **final** knowledge.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent's position as summarized in the Decision on Jurisdiction is the following:\n\nThe Respondent points out that, under Article XII(3)(c), an investor '**first**' acquires knowledge of an alleged breach and loss at a particular 'date.' For the Respondent, '[s]uch knowledge cannot 'first' be acquired at multiple points in time or on a recurring basis.' Here, the **Claimant** **first** **acquired knowledge of its alleged loss or damage with the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision in December 2010**, and acknowledged this publicly in a press release dated 18 January 2011, both before the cut-off date. In that press release, the Claimant stated that it was seeking to reestablish the value of its investments and to reverse **the negative impact of the 2010 TCA Decision** on the company's share price. While the cassation proceedings could have provided hope that the Administrative Chamber would reverse the Claimant's loss, **the fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was not reversed cannot be equated to a new loss**. Moreover, Infinito was not certain that it would be able to reverse the 2010 TCA Decision, and the fact that it acknowledged that it needed to '*restor*[e] the Company's rights or value' underscores that it believed that it had already suffered a loss.28 (Emphasis added).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 304, footnotes omitted.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant's position as summarized in the Decision on Jurisdiction is the following:\n\n316. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) *supra*, the Claimant emphasizes that the 2010 TCA Decision 'is **not**the measure that Infinito is challenging because it **did not result in the** **final** **or irreversible annulment** of Industrias Infinito's exploitation concession or other project approvals.' According to the Claimant, the annulment of Industrias Infinito's exploitation concession and other rights only **became** **final**and could only be acted upon when the Administrative Chamber refused to reverse the 2010 TCA Decision on 30 November 2011. (Emphasis on 'not' in the Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, and for the rest, emphasis added)29\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 316. This has been the leitmotiv of Claimant's position. See for example, a citation of its Reply, \u00a7 472: \u201cThere is [\u2026] overwhelming fact evidence that Infinito first knew, and only could have known, that the resolutions gra nt ing IISA's key approvals had been **finally and irreversibly annulled**, and that Infinito's investment in the Crucitas project had been rendered substantially worthless, on November 30, 2011.\u201d (Emphasis added)\n\n55.\n\nIt appears clearly that the positions of the two Parties are not contradictory: the Respondent argues that the Claimant had **first knowledge** of a violation and a loss with the TCA Decision of November 2010, before the cut-off date; the Claimant does not contest this (and has indicated as much in contemporaneous documents, as will be shown later); the Claimant argues however that it had **final knowledge** of a breach and a loss only with the refusal by the Administrative Chamber Decision dated 30 November 2011, after the cut-off date, to reverse the initial breach and loss existing already in 2010.\n\n**2. At All Relevant Times Before the Arbitration, the Claimant Considered that the Breach was Committed by the TCA Decision of 2010**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Just After the TCA Decision**\n----------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nFive days after the oral ruling of the TCA, the management of Infinito acknowledged that it was a negative decision:\n\nOn November 24, 2010 the Tribunal rendered a summary ruling on the challenges raised by a number of citizens [\u2026] The verbal ruling read in court was negative and **included cancellation of the Company's exploitation concessions, cancellation of the environmental and other approvals** held by the Company's local subsidiary, Industrias Infinito SA ('IISA'). [\u2026] (Emphasis added)\n\n57.\n\nThis is a recognition, in an internal document, even before the written ruling, that the TCA had cancelled all of Infinito's rights.30\n\nSecond Quarter Report, Management's Discussion and Analysis for the Three and Six Month Periods Ended September 30, 2010, **C-637**.\n\n58.\n\nSoon after Infinito received the written ruling of the TCA, the same analysis was made public, at the beginning of 2011. The Claimant itself acknowledged, in no doubtful terms, that it had suffered a breach of its rights and a loss brought about by the TCA Decision in a press-release dated 18 January 2011, that is before the cut-off date, which is a quite clear and crucial document:\n\nThe filing of the Casaci\u00f3n seeks to overturn **the Ruling which annulled the Exploitation Concession** of the Company's Crucitas gold project.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe Company is seeking **to re-establish the security and value** of its considerable and long term investments in Costa Rica and **to reverse the negative impact that the Ruling has had** with respect to the Company's share price and the **inherent negative impact** on its investors and employees.31 (Emphasis added)\n\nInfinito Gold Ltd. Press Release, \u201cInfinito Gold Files to Annul the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo Ruling,\u201d 18 January 2011, **C-246**.\n\n59.\n\nIn this press release, the Claimant **acknowledges the annulment of the Concession**, which it considered as **a breach**, as it wanted to try to overturn it through a cassation proceeding. It also wanted to erase the loss, as the cassation procedure was launched to restore the value of its investment. When an investor starts a proceeding in order to overturn a decision, it is on the assumption that such decision is illegal, thus a breach of the law having resulted in a loss for the investor.\n\n60.\n\nAt that point in time, the breach could be analyzed both as a breach of Costa Rican law and a breach of the Treaty. An alleged expropriation indeed falls squarely among the breaches of the BIT. Nothing prevented the investor just after the TCA Decision to go to ICSID immediately. Infinito rather chose to go to the national courts. I would also like to mention that the existence of a breach is an objective fact, contrary to the existence of a dispute which implies subjective elements to be ascertained.\n\n61.\n\nThe press release also said that among the future unknown factors is \u201cwhether the negative impacts of the Ruling on the Company can be reversed by the Casaci\u00f3n [\u2026]\u201d recognizing thus clearly that it had a first **knowledge** at the time of the TCA Decision of **damage** to its investment.\n\n62.\n\nThis press release shows undoubtedly knowledge by the Claimant, and even a **public recognition of breach and damage** on its date, 18 January 2011, which is before the cut-off date, while of course also indicating a hope to be able to modify the situation.\n\n63.\n\nI consider it also an important element in the interpretation of the facts of the case that Infinito started a cassation proceeding before the cut-off date, which means that **it clearly considered that there was a breach, at that point in time**. Moreover, in a Memorandum dated 17 February 2011 \u2013 and this is quite important \u2013 Infinito indicated that, while the proceeding before the Administrative Chamber was unfolding, **it could at any time go to international arbitration**:\n\nThe Company can elect to halt the appeal process and move to international arbitration at any point in time during the process.32\n\nMemorandum from John Morgan (Infinito Gold Ltd.) to Q3 2011 Interim W/P File regarding the ruling issued by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal (17 February 2011), p. 5, **C-667**.\n\n64.\n\nWhen an investor considers resorting to international arbitration, it is because it considers that it has suffered a breach of its rights by the State, and suffered damages. In other words, on 17 February 2011, before the Administrative Chamber Decision, Infinito considered that it had suffered a breach, which could be the basis of an international claim.\n\n65.\n\nAcknowledgments by the Claimant of a breach before the Administrative Chamber Decision are numerous. I just give here another example, which is a Report on an update on Crucitas Project dated 24 June 2011:33\n\nOn November 24, 2010 the Tribunal Contencioso Adminastrativo [*sic*] (the 'Tribunal') rendered a summary ruling (the 'Ruling') on the challenges raised by a number of citizens against the relevant government agencies alleging that certain official approvals and permits received by the Company's wholly owned subsidiary in Costa Rica, Industrias Infinito SA ('IISA'), pertaining to the Crucitas gold mining project, were not issued in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**The Ruling annulled the Exploitation Concession of the Company's Crucitas gold project**. In addition, the Ruling invalidated the original approval of the environmental impact study received in December of 2005 during the Abel Pacheco presidency, the amended environmental impact study received in February of 2008, and the Presidential Decree declaring the project to be in the national interest received in October of 2008. The Ruling also states that the Company may be liable to restore certain areas at the Crucitas mine site to their original pre-tree-clearing condition.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn the Casaci\u00f3n the Company is seeking **to overturn the Ruling** [\u2026]. (Emphasis added)\n\nUpdate on Crucitas Project, 24 June 2011, **R-310**, p. 1.\n\n**b. Just After the Administrative Chamber Decision**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimant still refers to the TCA Decision as the breach, after the Administrative Chamber Decision. In a press release dated the day of the Administrative Chamber Decision, Infinito wrote the following:\n\nInfinito Gold Ltd. (the 'Company') announces that the Administrative Law Chamber of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica ('SALA I') has rendered its decision and **rejected the request for annulment** ('Casaci\u00f3n') of the sentence (the 'TCA Ruling') imposed by the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo ('TCA') on November 24, 2010, in respect of the Company's gold mining permits and the Costa Rican permitting procedures for the Crucitas gold project.\n\n**The TCA Ruling annulled the Exploitation Concession of the Company's Crucitas gold project** [\u2026].34 (Emphasis added)\n\nInfinito Gold Ltd. Press Release, \u201cSALA I Upholds Tribunal Decision,\u201d 30 November 2011, **C-262**.\n\n67.\n\nEven after the Administrative Chamber Decision of November 2011, according to the Claimant itself, the annulment of the concession, which is the act complained of, *i.e*., the breach, occurred with the TCA Decision.\n\n**3. At All Times \u2013 Before and During the Arbitration \u2013 the Costa Rican Authorities Considered that the Alleged Breach was Committed by the TCA Decision of 2010**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nAll the final steps of the proceedings against Infinito were based on the TCA Decision, not on the Administrative Chamber Decision.\n\n69.\n\nFor example, the 2012 MINAET Resolution, Cancellation of the Concession,35 indicates the following:\n\nCONSIDERING THAT\n\n1) Oral Judicial Decision No. 4399-2010 issued at 4:00 p.m. on **December 14, 2010, by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal**, section IV, determined, among other matters, to '[\u2026] set aside resolutions number 3638-2005-SETENA, number 170-2008-SETENA, number R-217-2008-MINAE, number 244-2008- SCH and Executive Decree number 34801-MINAET [\u2026].' '[\u2026] The National Mining Registry is ordered to cancel the concession for Industrias Infinito S.A. which was processed as mining file N\u00b0 2594[\u2026]'.\n\n2) The Judicial Decision of the Contentious Administrative Tribunal cited above was **confirmed** by the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, and as a result became **final**.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nWHEREAS\n\nONE: In due compliance with the sentence as required under Articles 156 section 1 and 158 of the Contentious Administrative Procedural Code, we hereby declare the cancellation of the mining exploitation concession granted to the company Industrias Infinito S.A., **which was rendered null and void** by decision N\u00b0 4399-2010 issued at 4:00 p.m. on December 14, 2010, **by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal**, section IV.\n\nTHEREFORE\n\nBy virtue of the foregoing, in due compliance with the decision in accordance with Articles 156 section 1 and 158 of the Contentious Administrative Procedural Code, we hereby declare the cancellation of the mining exploitation concession granted to the company Industrias Infinito S.A., granted by Executive Branch resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE at 3:00 p.m. on April 21, 2008, which **was rendered null and void by decision No. 4399-2010 issued at 4:00 p.m. on the December 14, 2010, by the Contentious Administrative Tribunal**, section IV. Administrative file 2594 is archived, the area is liberated from the Mining Registry. (Emphasis added)\n\nResolution No. 0037, Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications, File No. 2594, 9 January 2012, **C-268**.\n\n70.\n\nIn other words, the Costa Rican authorities themselves considered that the annulment of the concession was NOT performed by the Administrative Chamber Decision but by the TCA Decision, which has not been overturned. The Administrative Chamber's Decision is a failed attempt by Infinito to correct **a breach that had already occurred**.\n\n**D. C****onclusion**\n---------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn conclusion, I am totally convinced that all the \u201cmeasures\u201d challenged by the Claimant are nothing more than decisions not to reverse the 2010 TCA Decision and/or measures of implementation of the TCA Decision or other pre-existing measures.\n\n72.\n\nThe fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was not reversed by the Administrative Chamber Decision cannot be equated to a new breach or a new loss. It just meant that the first breach and loss which occurred before the cut-off date, were not cured. All of the other challenged measures are deeply rooted in the 2010 TCA Decision, and none of them were distinct and legally significant events. It must be reiterated that, had the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision not been issued, the Claimant's Concession would have remained annulled.\n\n73.\n\nI would therefore have concluded that jurisdiction was lacking.\n\n**II. MERITS: THE SCOPE OF THE FET STANDARD IN ARTICLE II(2)(A) OF THE BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nAs mentioned at the outset of this opinion, I will \u2013 although quite briefly \u2013 discuss the interpretation of the standard of FET made by the majority as a standard disconnected from the principles of international law. I do not consider this analysis to be in accordance with the structure of public international law, as I will explain. This misunderstanding has the double consequence that the majority of the Tribunal considered, firstly that the FET standard is an autonomous standard different from the Minimum Standard of Treatment of customary international law and secondly, that when applied to a review of courts' decisions, a finding of a violation of the autonomous FET is less demanding than denial of justice.\n\n**A. I****s** **T****he** **FET S****tandard in the** **R****elevant** **BIT** **an** **A****utonomous** **S****tandard or** **I****s** **I****T E****quivalent to** **MST?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe question raised by the Parties is a divergence concerning the scope of the FET standard of protection of foreign investors. As summarized in \u00a7 328 of the Award, \u201c[t]he Claimant argues that this provision provides for an autonomous FET standard, while the Respondent considers that it is limited to the MST under international law.\u201d\n\n76.\n\nAs always, the starting point for the interpretation of the standards of protection is the text of the BIT. Article II(2)(a) of the BIT provides that:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall accord investments of the other Contracting Party: (a) fair and equitable treatment **in accordance with principles of international law**; [\u2026] (Emphasis added)\n\n77.\n\nMy first remark is that the members of the majority **add a word** to Article II(2)(a) when they concentrate their analysis on \u201cgeneral principles\u201d of international law, while the text refers to \u201cprinciples\u201d of international law.\n\n78.\n\nI consider that a rigorous legal approach has to be based on the exact expression to be analyzed. In that sense, a distinction has to be made between \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d (*principes* ***du*** *droit international*), \u201cgeneral principles of law\u201d (*principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux* ***de*** *droit*) and \u201cgeneral principles of international law\u201d (*principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux* ***du*** *droit international*).\n\n79.\n\n**Principles of international law** can easily be understood as merely a reference to general international law. This has in fact been stated by the PCIJ in the famous *Lotus* case36 in no dubious terms:\n\n[T]he Court considers that the words 'principles of international law', as ordinarily used, can only mean international law as it is applied between all nations belonging to the community of States.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nIn these circumstances it is impossible \u2013 except in pursuance of a definite stipulation \u2013 to construe the expression 'principles of international law' otherwise than as meaning the principles which are in force between all independent nations [\u2026].37\n\n*The Case of the S.S. \u201cLotus\u201d*, Judgment, 7 September 1927, Serie A, No. 10. The Court was interpreting the following provision: \u201cSubject to the provisions of Article 16, all questions of jurisdiction shall, as between Turkey and the other contracting Powers, be **decided in accordance with the principles of international law**.\u201d *Id*., p. 16 (Emphasis a dded)\n\n*Id*., pp. 16-17. French version : \u201cOr, la Cour estime que le sens des mots 'principes **du** droit international' ne peut, selon leur usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, signifier autre chose que le droit international tel qu'il est en vigueur entre toutes les nations faisant partie de la communaut\u00e9 internationale. [\u2026] Dans ces conditions, il n'est pas possible \u2013 sauf en vertu d'un texte pr\u00e9cis \u2013 d'interpr\u00e9ter le terme 'principes du droit international' autrement que comme signifiant les principes en vigueur entre toutes les nations ind\u00e9pendantes [\u2026].\u201d\n\n80.\n\nThis interpretation is even more compelling here, as the BIT asks the Tribunal also to take into account in its analyses the \u201c**rules**\u201d of international law, as indicated in Article XII (7) entitled \u201cSettlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Contracting Party\u201d referring to the applicable law:\n\nA tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of international law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the extent that the domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or the principles of international law.\n\n81.\n\nI consider that the double reference to \u201cthe applicable rules of international law\u201d and to \u201cthe principles of international law\u201d, without elaborating more on this topic, especially on the content of the MST, is sufficient to conclude that the FET must be interpreted according to international law as applied among all nations, which is customary international law. Therefore, the FET standard is limited by the BIT to the Minimum Standard of Treatment under customary international law.\n\n82.\n\nThis is supported by Canada, in its intervention as a Non\u2013Disputing Party, as mentioned in the Award, \u00a7 322, which stated that:\n\nCanada contends that the phrase 'in accordance with principles of international law' is a reference to the MST. Pursuant to the principle of *effet utile*, **this phrase must be given meaning**. This interpretation is confirmed by the Notes of Interpretation issued under some of Canada's treaties, such as the one under the NAFTA.38 (Emphasis added)\n\nThis is in line with the uncontested interpretation in the same way of Article 1105 of NAFTA, which provides that \u201c[e]ach Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment **in accordance with international law**, including fair and equitable treatment [\u2026].\u201d NAFTA, Article 1105(1) (emphasis added). According to Canada, \u201c[t]here is no difference between the FET standard in NAFTA Article 1105(1) and Article II(2)(a) of the Canada-Costa Rica FIPA.\u201d Canada's Submission, \u00a7 22.\n\n83.\n\nAnd the meaning given to the reference of \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d by Canada in \u00a7 20 of its Non-Disputing Party Submission is the following:\n\nThe wording in Article II(2)(a) guarantees FET in accordance with the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\n\n84.\n\nThis conclusion is rejected by the majority. And in fact, the majority's analysis arrives at a conclusion that **does not give any meaning, any** ***effet utile*** **to the reference in the BIT to the principles of international law**, which are completely ignored. In other words, international law has been eliminated, although it is mentioned in the BIT. The result would have been exactly the same, in the absence of the expression \u201cin accordance with principles of international law.\u201d Moreover, even having based its analysis on the general principles of international law, the majority has not endeavored to give any content to these general principles that could be used for the interpretation of the FET standard.\n\n85.\n\nIn fact, I was at pains to understand how the conclusion of the majority was arrived at, but I think it is important to clarify, at the outset, the necessary distinctions to be made, which have been ignored by the majority. I refer to the *Dictionnaire de droit international public*,39 which clearly distinguishes the three concepts earlier mentioned.\n\n*Dictionnaire de droit international public*, dir. Jean Salmon, Bruyland, Bruxelles, 2001.\n\n86.\n\nFirst, \u201cPrinciples of international law\u201d (p. 877):\n\n*E. Dans l'expression 'principes du droit international' ensemble de propositions fondamentales du droit international.*\n\n*L'expression peut alors signifier*\n\n*(a) **ou bien l'ensemble du droit international dans ses bases essentielles***\n\n*(b)* [\u2026] *ou bien l'ensemble des principes gouvernant un type de relations: ainsi les 'principes du droit international touchant les relations amicales'.*\n\n*(c)* [\u2026] *ou bien encore les principes gouvernant un domaine particulier du droit international:*\n\n*Exemples:*\n\n[\u2026] *les principes du contentieux international*.\n\nE. [\u2026] the expression 'principles of international law' the body of fundamental propositions of international law.\n\nThe expression can thus mean\n\n**(a) either international law as a whole in its essential bases**\n\n(b) [...] or all of the principles governing a type of relationship: thus the 'principles of international law concerning the friendly relations'.\n\n(c) [\u2026] or even the principles governing a particular area of international law:\n\nExamples:\n\n[\u2026] the principles of international litigation.\n\n87.\n\nPoint a) refers in fact to the position of the PCIJ on the principles of international law in the *Lotus* case. Another example to illustrate b) or c) could of course be the international principles relating to the protection of foreign investment, among which the MST and denial of justice.\n\n88.\n\nSecond, \u201cGeneral principles of law\u201d (p. 879):\n\n*Source autonome du droit international aux termes de l'article 38 \u00a7 1 du Statut de la Cour internationale de Justice*.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Selon une doctrine majoritaire ces principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de droit sont des principes communs aux ordres juridiques internes* [\u2026] *et transposables \u00e0 l'ordre international.*\n\nAutonomous source of international law under Article 38 \u00a7 1 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nAccording to a majority of scholars, these general principles of law are principles common to internal legal orders [...] and transposable to the international order.\n\n89.\n\nIn the *Droit international public* of Dailler, Forteau and Pellet,40 some of these general principles of law are mentioned: good faith, principle of *effet utile*, principle of full reparation of damages, equality of the parties and so on.\n\n*Droit international public*, Patrick Dailler, Mathias Forteau, Alain Pellet, 8 Ed., LGDJ, 2009.\n\n90.\n\nThird, \u201cGeneral principles of international law\u201d (p. 880):\n\n*Principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du droit international*\n\n*Formulation globalisatrice des principales r\u00e8gles du droit international* ***issues du droit coutumier*** *ou du droit conventionnel*. (Emphasis added)\n\nGeneral principle of international law\n\nGlobalizing formulation of the main rules of international law which **stem from customary** or conventional law. (Emphasis added)\n\n91.\n\nSome examples are given under this rubric: the prohibition of the use of force or the principle of non-intervention, to which can be added, among others, the principle of self-determination.\n\n92.\n\nSome examples are also given by Patrick Dumberry, cited by the majority, in an article entitled \u201cThe Emergence of the Concept of 'General Principle of International Law'\u201d,41 in which he studies the concepts of burden of proof, estoppel, *res judicata* and abuse of rights. Interestingly, he also remarks that:\n\nMost tribunals seem to have a poor understanding of both the meaning and the function of general principles under international law. Awards often do not explain where the general principles they mention are emerging from (i.e. from which legal order: domestic or international?). Tribunals also rarely explain why they are referring to a given principle and which function or role it actually plays in their reasoning.42\n\nPatrick Dumberry, \u201cThe Emergence of the Concept of 'General Principle of International Law' in Investment Arbitration Case Law,\u201d Journal of International Dispute Settlement, 2020, 11, pp. 194\u2013216.\n\nPatrick Dumberry, \u201cThe Emergence of the Concept of 'General Principle of International Law' in Investment Arbitration Case Law,\u201d Journal of International Dispute Settlement, 2020, 11, p. 196.\n\n93.\n\nThis is a warning to all arbitrators.\n\n94.\n\nLet us now look at the starting premise of the majority's analysis, in \u00a7 332 of the Award:\n\nStarting first with the ordinary meaning of the terms, there is nothing in the text of the BIT that limits the FET standard to customary international law. [\u2026] the expression 'principles of international law' cannot be regarded as a reference to customary international law which is but one source of international law and is distinct from general principles.43\n\nAward, \u00a7 332.\n\n95.\n\nThis paragraph is quite problematic: the two concepts of principles of international law and general principles are used in the same sentence and seem to be considered equivalent. But more importantly, contrary to what the majority claims here, it is quite clear, as explained by the PCIJ in the *Lotus* case, that a mention of \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d is indeed a reference to customary international law.\n\n96.\n\nI conclude that the majority has erred in basing its analysis on the general principles of international law and not on the principles of international law.44\n\nSubsidia rily, I also disagree with the extensive analysis performed by the majority concerning the source of the general principles of international law, even if, as explained earlier, the latter is irrelevant and should not have been referred to at all. However, this is more an academic theoretical debate, where different analyses of the source of the general principles of international law can be made, rooted in different understandings of the structure of international law and I don't think it is necessary to enter here into this debate. I will simply point out that, in fact, what the majority ignores in its analysis is that both the principles of international law and the general principles of international law are closely linked with custom, the principles of international law being equivalent to customary international law and the general principles of international law deriving \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 from customary international law.\n\n97.\n\nHaving eliminated the reference to principles of international law, the majority concludes that the FET is an autonomous standard, whose scope is not defined in customary international law, allowing therefore the arbitral Tribunal to decide freely what are the sources of international law and what are the contours of concepts like FET or denial of justice, without any constraint coming from principles of international law, as required by the BIT, nor indeed from the general principles of international law referred to erroneously by the majority.\n\n98.\n\nI think that arbitrators have a mission to fulfil in the framework of the provision giving them jurisdiction. When they are required to interpret concepts in accordance with principles of international law, their power is limited by the content of these principles, *i.e*., by customary international law.\n\n**B. I****s** **T****he** **FET S****tandard** **W****hen** **A****pplied to** **C****ourts****' D****ecisions** **L****ess** **D****emanding T****han** **D****enial of** **J****ustice****?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nWhat I consider the same misunderstanding of the structure of public international law is at the root of my strong disagreement with the analysis of the role of denial of justice. More precisely, the majority stated the following:45\n\nCosta Rica and Canada essentially argue that, absent a denial of justice, judicial decisions interpreting domestic law cannot breach international law, and that 'claims of arbitrariness or unfairness in the context of judicial decisions must be viewed through the lens of denial of justice.' **The Tribunal agrees that this is the case under customary international law**. The question before the Tribunal is, however, whether judicial measures breach the BIT's FET standard, which the Tribunal has held not to be limited to the MST under customary international law. (Emphasis added)\n\nAward, \u00a7 357.\n\n100.\n\nIt is because the majority has considered that the principles of international law do not refer to customary international law, that it also rejected the well accepted concept of denial of justice in customary international law and therefore concluded that \u201cjudicial decisions that are arbitrary, unfair or contradict an investor's legitimate expectations may also breach the FET standard even if they do not rise to the level of a denial of justice,\u201d46 going as far as to state that a court can violate international law even if it \u201capplies domestic law correctly.\u201d47\n\nAward, \u00a7 359.\n\nAward, \u00a7 360.\n\n101.\n\nI understand that the majority agrees that if the FET were equivalent to the MST, denial of justice would be the only standard of review of national courts decisions.\n\n102.\n\nThe majority, however, considered that, as it analyzed the FET is an autonomous standard, the review of national courts' decisions by an international tribunal can go significantly beyond the denial of justice. This question is hotly debated.\n\n103.\n\nAs a first mention in this debate, it can be said that it is common ground that the interdiction of denial of justice is part of FET, even when considered as an autonomous standard. This was clearly articulated in many investment awards, for example in *Jan de Nul v. Egypt*:\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the 2002 and 1977 BITs do not comprise a specific provision regarding the miscarriage or denial of justice. It considers, however, that **the fair and equitable treatment standard encompasses the notion of denial of justice**.48 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, \u00a7 188, **RL-091**.\n\n104.\n\nIt is also not contested that a finding of denial of justice is a very demanding one. This has been articulated for example in *Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic*:\n\n**The Tribunal notes that a claim for denial of justice under international law is a demanding one**. To meet the applicable test, it will not be enough to claim that municipal law has been breached, that the decision of a national court is erroneous, that a judicial procedure was incompetently conducted, or that the actions of the judge in question were probably motivated by corruption. A denial of justice implies the failure of a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards.49 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Awa rd, 23 April 2012, 273, **RL-017**.\n\n105.\n\nThe same position was also adopted in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*:50\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment obligation may be breached if the host State's judicial system subjects an investor to denial of justice. The Parties appear to be broadly in agreement on the legal standard for a denial of justice. Both cite *Arif v. Moldova*, its basic proposition being that a denial of justice is found '*if* and *when* the judiciary breached the standard by *fundamentally* unfair proceedings and ***outrageously*** **wrong, final and binding decisions.'**\n\n**An elevated standard of proof is required for finding a denial of justice due to the gravity of a charge which condemns the State's judicial system as such**. A denial of justice claim may be asserted only after all available means offered by the State's judiciary to redress the denial of justice have been exhausted. As held by one decision, '[a] denial of justice implies the failure of a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards.' (Emphasis added)\n\n*Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7 (formerly FTR Holding SA, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay), Award, 8 July 2016, \u00a7\u00a7 498-499, **RL-222**.\n\n106.\n\nWhat is debated is whether a lesser standard of FET is also applicable when international tribunals review the judgments of national courts.\n\n107.\n\nThe problem I see with the majority's position is that it can authorize an international tribunal to review fully a national court decision and therefore to act, in fact, as a court of appeal, which is unanimously considered as beyond its powers, as even recognized by this Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, where it is stated that \u201cit is not its role to act as a court of appeal with respect to decisions of domestic courts.\u201d51\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 217. See also, *Helnan International Hotels A.S. v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. 05/19, Award, 3 July 2008, \u00a7\u00a7 106, 263, **RL-010**; *Luigiterzo Bosca v. The Republic of Lithuania*, UNCITRAL PCA Case No. 2011-05, Award, 17 May 2013, \u00a7 198, **RL-011**.\n\n108.\n\nThis is common ground, as can be illustrated by many awards, of which I give just one example, the *Helnan v. Egypt* case, where the tribunal stated:\n\nAn ICSID Tribunal **will not act as an instance to review matters of domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance**.

Thereafter, on 19 July 2016, APREFLOFAS filed its Non-Disputing Party Submission, together with exhibits NDP-0001 to NDP-0013 (\u201c**APREFLOFAS\u2019s First Submission**\u201d); and on 18 August 2016 it submitted exhibit translations designated as NDP-0014 to NDP-0020.7 In the Decision on Jurisdiction,8 the Tribunal deferred to the merits phase the issue raised by APREFLOFAS of whether the Claimant\u2019s investment complied with the legality requirement provided in Article I(g) of the BIT.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 41-50.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 135-140, 364.\n\n30.\n\nOn 27 December 2017, on instructions of the Tribunal, the ICSID Secretariat informed APREFLOFAS that in accordance with the Procedural Calendar agreed upon by the Parties, should APREFLOFAS intend to file an application to intervene as a Non-Disputing Party during the merits phase of this arbitration, it should do so no later than 19 January 2018.\n\n31.\n\nOn 19 January 2018, APREFLOFAS filed a second petition for *amicus curiae (i.e.,* non-disputing party) status (\u201c**APREFLOFAS\u2019s Second Petition**\u201d).\n\n32.\n\nOn 9 February 2018, the Parties submitted their comments to APREFLOFAS\u2019s Second Petition. The Parties\u2019 comments were accompanied by legal authorities CL-0239 to CL-02409 and RL-0182, respectively.\n\nOn 20 February 2018, the Tribunal observed that the Claimant had already submitted a legal authority numbered CL-0239, and for clarity of the record, it informed the Parties that the legal authority formerly filed as CL-0239 would be renumbered as CL-0241.\n\n33.\n\nOn 22 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on APREFLOFAS\u2019s Second Petition (\u201c**PO5**\u201d). The Tribunal (i) authorized APREFLOFAS to file a Non-Disputing Party Submission; (ii) granted it access to the Parties\u2019 pleadings on jurisdiction and the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits and an index of exhibits and legal authorities on the record, subject to confidentiality restrictions; and (iii) afforded the Parties an opportunity to present their observations on APREFLOFAS\u2019s Non-Disputing Party Submission in their submissions on the merits.\n\n34.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, pursuant to paragraph 54(a)(v) of PO5, each Party submitted its consolidated index of exhibits and legal authorities for transmission to APREFLOFAS.\n\n35.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, APREFLOFAS received the pleadings and index authorized by the Tribunal at paragraph 54(a) of PO5.\n\n36.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, APREFLOFAS filed its Second Non-Disputing Party Submission, together with exhibits NDP-0021 to NDP-0035 (\u201c**APREFLOFAS\u2019s Second Submission**\u201d). Pursuant to paragraph 54(d) of PO5, the Parties presented their observations on APREFLOFAS\u2019s Second Submission in their submissions on the merits.\n\n**2. Canada\u2019s Non-Disputing Party Application and Submission**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn 24 August 2018, Canada made an application to file a written submission as a Non-Disputing Party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) (\u201c**Canada\u2019s Application**\u201d), concerning the interpretation of the BIT. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their observations on Canada\u2019s Application by 31 August 2018.\n\n38.\n\nOn 31 August 2018, the Parties submitted their observations to Canada\u2019s Application.\n\n39.\n\nOn 18 September 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision on Canada\u2019s Application. In its ruling, the Tribunal authorized Canada to file a Non-Disputing Party Submission by 30 November 2018, limited to providing comments on the BIT provisions in dispute. The Tribunal ruled that should Canada wish to file documents together with its written submission, it could only submit documents not already on the record.\n\n40.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal\u2019s request, each Party submitted its consolidated list of exhibits and authorities to date, respectively on 18 and 21 September 2018, which were subsequently circulated to Canada on 21 September 2018.\n\n41.\n\nOn 30 November 2018, Canada filed its Non-Disputing Party Submission, together with legal authorities CAN-0001 to CAN-0022 (\u201c**Canada\u2019s Submission**\u201d).\n\n42.\n\nOn 10 December 2018, the ICSID Secretariat informed the Parties that a third party had sought access to Canada\u2019s Application, the Parties\u2019 observations to it, and Canada\u2019s Submission. The Parties were invited to provide their comments. On the same day, the Respondent provided its consent for disclosure of the requested documents. On 13 December 2018, the Claimant objected to said disclosure. Accordingly, on 17 December 2018, the ICSID Secretariat confirmed that, in light of the Parties\u2019 responses and pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 22(2), the aforementioned materials would not be published or shared by the Centre.\n\n43.\n\nOn 31 December 2018, the Respondent informed that, unless the Tribunal instructed otherwise, it intended to disclose to the public Canada\u2019s Submission on 7 January 2019. On the following day, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on this matter by 3 January 2019.\n\n44.\n\nOn 3 January 2019, the Claimant confirmed that it had no objections to the disclosure of Canada\u2019s Submission by Costa Rica, but it reserved all rights to make submissions to the Tribunal with respect to disclosure of any additional parts of the record.\n\n**D. P****re-Hearing Procedure**\n--------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nOn 14 June 2019, the Parties jointly requested an extension of time to identify the witnesses and experts to be cross-examined at the Hearing on the Merits. On 17 June 2019, the Tribunal granted the extension.\n\n46.\n\nOn 19 June 2019, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal their agreement on the list of witnesses and experts to be cross-examined at the Hearing on the Merits. The Parties further observed that they continued holding discussions to narrow down the list.\n\n47.\n\nOn 21 June 2019, the Tribunal circulated a Draft of Procedural Order No. 7 (\u201c**Draft PO7**\u201d), to serve as agenda for the Pre-Hearing Organizational Call, and invited the Parties to provide their observations thereto.\n\n48.\n\nOn 26 June 2019, the Parties submitted their joint comments to Draft PO7 and indicated their points of discord.\n\n49.\n\nOn 27 June 2019, the President of the Tribunal (by delegation of her co-arbitrators) and the Parties held a Pre-Hearing Organizational Call in preparation of the Hearing on the Merits.

The Claimant undertook to make the necessary logistical arrangements and to cover any reasonable costs associated with the conduct of the examination by videoconference.\n\n53.\n\nOn 12 July 2019, Tribunal endorsed the Parties\u2019 agreement concerning the examination of Mr. Rauguth by videoconference.\n\n54.\n\nOn 15 July 2019, the Tribunal issued further logistical and procedural directions for the examination of Mr. Rauguth by videoconference.

P****ost-Hearing Procedure**\n---------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nOn 29 July 2019, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties a summary of certain directions on Post-Hearing matters discussed at the conclusion of the Hearing on the Merits.

The proceeding was closed on 19 May 2021.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIn May 2000, the Claimant (then known as Vannessa Ventures Ltd.) acquired Industrias Infinito S.A. (\u201c**Industrias Infinito**\u201d).14 Industrias Infinito held an exploration permit for the Crucitas area which had been granted in 1993,15 the term of which had been extended to 18 September 1999.16 One of Industrias Infinito\u2019s predecessor companies had submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (\u201c**EIA**\u201d), which had been approved on 1 October 1993 by the Interdisciplinary Evaluation and Control Commission for Environmental Impact Studies (\u201c**CONEIA**\u201d) \u2014 competent body before National Technical Environmental Secretariat (\u201c**SETENA**\u201d) was created.17\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 63.\n\nAs discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, this exploration permit had been obtained by the company Vientos de Abangares, S.A., and then transferred to Placer Dome de Costa Rica, S.A., which was Industrias Infinito's previous name under other owners. *See* Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n\nC-Mem.

This included a pre-feasibility study in 1996,19 which was accompanied by several reports and reviews on the viability of the Project;20 other studies and reports addressing the environmental and socio-economic impact of the Project;21 and a feasibility study in 1999 that proved the existence of a substantial gold deposit in the Las Crucitas area.22\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Placer Dome Explorations, Cerro Crucitas Project, Pre-Feasibility Study (December 1996), Exh. **C-0040**.\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6 34; Placer Dome de Costa Rica, Report on Black Sewage (Septic Tank) Treatment System Operation and Maintenance (September 1995), Exh. **C-0026**; Placer Dome Inc., Preliminary Metallurgical Evaluation (September 1995), Exh. **C-0027**; Placer Dome Inc., Gravity Concentration/Cyanide Leaching and Gravity Centration/Flotation Tests on Three Rock Type Composites (July 1996), Exh. **C-0032**; Hay & Company Consultants Inc., Sediment Reconnaissance Survey: Cerro Crucitas Project (August 1996), Exh. **C-0033**; Placer Dome de Costa Rica, Phase 1 Assessment of Potential for Acid Rock Drainage at the Cerro Crucitas Project, Costa Rica (5 December 1996), Exh. **C-0041**; Bruce Geotechnical Consultants Inc., Cerro Crucitas-Tailing Dam Assessment Area B Tailing and Waste Rock Materials Balance (28 August 1997), Exh. **C-0043**.\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37; Annex 4 to Exploration Permit No. 7339: Socio-Economic Study (November 1998), Exh. **C-0047**; ICAPD Socio-Economic Impact Study (July 1995), Exh. **C-0025**; ICAPD Social Impact Study (December 1995), Exh. **C-0030**.\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6 38; Placer Dome, Feasibility Study (Executive Summary) (September 1999), Exh. **C-0052**.\n\n71.\n\nIn December 1999, Industrias Infinito submitted the feasibility study to the Directorate of Geology and Mines (\u201c**DGM**\u201d) and requested an exploitation concession to develop a surface gold mine at Las Crucitas.23\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 74; Placer Dome, Feasibility Study - Executive Summary (September 1999), Exh. **C-0052**; Industrias Infinito S.A., Request for Exploitation Concession (18 December 1999), Exh. **C-0053**.\n\n72.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2001, Industrias Infinito continued the exploration work and obtained an updated resource estimate.24\n\nCWS-Rauguth 1, \u00b6\u00b6 64-76.\n\n73.\n\nOn 7 June 2001, the DGM approved the feasibility study, including the socio-economic and environmental impacts of the Project.25\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 80; Resolution No. 364-2001 (7 June 2001), Exh. **C-0064**.\n\n74.\n\nOn 17 December 2001, Industrias Infinito obtained its exploitation concession, with a ten-year term subject to extensions and one renewal, allowing it to extract, process and sell the minerals from the Las Crucitas gold deposit.26 The concession became effective on 30 January 2002 (the \u201c**2002 Concession**\u201d).27 The exploitation concession specified that \u201c[t]he concession holder, prior to commencing the exploitation activities, shall obtain the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment, duly approved by the [SETENA].

On 5 June 2002, President Pacheco declared an indefinite moratorium on open-pit mining (the \u201c**2002 Moratorium**\u201d).32 It is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium operated prospectively and did not affect acquired rights.33\n\nExecutive Decree No. 30477-MINAE (5 June 2002), Exh. **C-0080**.\n\nExecutive Decree No. 30477-MINAE (5 June 2002), Exh. **C-0080**, Transitional Provision I provided: \u201cAny procedures related to the exploration and open-pit mining of gold currently pending before the [DGM] and before the [SETENA] to the date of publication hereof shall be suspended. Any rights acquired before the publication of this decree will be respected.\u201d\n\n79.\n\nOn 12 August 2002, another mining concession holder, Rio Minerales S.A., filed an *amparo* petition against the 2002 Moratorium, arguing that it violated the principles of legality, judicial certainty and non-retroactivity, as well as its vested rights and those of Industrias Infinito. On 20 August 2002, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the 2002 Moratorium did not violate the petitioner\u2019s rights and was not retroactive in light of its grandfathering provision (\u201c**2002 Constitutional Chamber Decision**\u201d).34 In its findings, the Constitutional Court expressly stated that the same applied to Industrias Infinito, as follows:35\n\n[N]o fundamental right has been violated - at least not in a direct manner-by the enactment of the Executive Decree No. 30477-MINAE of June 5th of this year. While it is true that through this decree the Executive declares a national moratorium on open-pit gold mining in the national territory for an undefined term (article 1), it is also true that in Transitional provision 1 it expressly establishes that all \u2018[...] rights acquired before the publication of this decree will be respected', therefore the objections made by the appellant lack[] substance. That means ***this decree [does not] violate rights acquired or [] juridical situations [established] in favor of [the] companies that [currently] carry out the activity subject to the indefinite moratorium, as the decree expressively provides for their protection****.* Eventually, a ***violation may result from its application, but that [has not] happened either****.* The threats to the fundamental rights that the appellant claims are no more than mere subjective fears. The fact that both the President of the Republic and the Minister of the Environment and Energy have made certain statements to the media, according to which, in the opinion of the appellant, [they] will indemnify the companies Rio Minerales S.A. and ***Industrias Infinito S.A****.,* holders of the exploitation concessions in the National Mining Registry of the Directorate of Geology and Mines, presents no threat to the companies' fundamental rights since they merely are informal declarations without any action on behalf of the Executive Power to stop these companies from the exploitation of the granted concessions. The threat must be real and imminent, meaning that there must be concrete acts by the administration that threaten a fundamental right, which is not the case here. On the contrary, ***the text of the disputed decree itself shows respect for the acquired rights of these companies, and as a result there has been no violation of its fundamental rights****.* In consequence, the present appeal is rejected, as is declared in effect.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (20 August 2002), Exh. **C-0085**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (20 August 2002), Sole Whereas (emphasis added), Exh. **C-0085**.

As a result, on that same day, Industrias Infinito appealed this decision before the MINAE.38 The MINAE agreed with Industrias Infinito, and, on 20 October 2003, ordered the SETENA to conduct a new evaluation of Industrias Infinito\u2019s application.39\n\nResolution No. 272-2003-SETENA (11 March 2003), Exh. **C-0097**.\n\nR-Mem.

It held that the 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment, because that concession was granted prior to the approval of the EIA. Specifically, the Constitutional Chamber held that, given the definition of the EIA in the Mining Code, and in line with the preventive/precautionary principle,42 \u201cit is clear that the Environmental Impact Assessment is necessary to obtain the exploitation concession.\u201d43 The Constitutional Chamber noted that the preventive (precautionary) principle in environmental matters had been incorporated into the constitutional regime through a judgment of 21 December 2001, and was reinforced by Article 34 of the Mining Code and Article 9 of the Regulation of the Mining Code.44 It also found that the Government had not previously consulted the communities that might be affected by the concession.45 The Constitutional Chamber thus held that the grant of the 2002 Concession had violated the preventive/precautionary principle and the constitutional right to a healthy and balanced environment.46 It thus annulled the 2002 Concession, *\u201ctodo sin perjuicio de lo que determine el estudio de impacto ambiental,\u201d47* which the Respondent translates as \u201cwithout prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment ***may determine****,\u201948* while the Claimant\u2019s translation is \u201cwithout prejudice to the findings of the Environmental Impact Assessment.\u201d49 The Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s translation is more accurate.\n\nThe Constitutional Chamber refers to the *\u201cprincipio de prevenci\u00f3n\",* but the translation refers to the preventive principle or precautionary principle indistinctly.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Section IV, p. 24 (PDF) (English), p. 57 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Section IV, pp. 26-27 (PDF) (English), pp. 60-61 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Section VII, pp. 30-32 (PDF) (English), pp. 64-66 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Sections V, VI and VIII, pp. 27-30, 32 (PDF) (English), pp. 61-64, 66 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Operative Part, pp. 32-33 (PDF) (English), pp. 66-67 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nR-Mem.

As a consequence, the motion filed is unfounded and should be declared as such.\n\nII.- As for determining the nature of the annulment \u2014whether absolute or relative\u2014of [the 2002 Concession] [...] these are aspects related to the validity of the administrative decree elements whose content and transcendence may not and must not be discussed or determined by this appeal as it constitutes a matter of administrative nature that exceeds the competence of this Court. However, the petitioner should keep in mind that the annulment [of the 2002 Concession] set in [the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision], is not because defects were detected in the administrative decree itself which, as it was stated, may only be declared by the competent administrative authorities or before a common judge, but because the Chamber determined that the decree was infringing the precautionary principle and constitutional right for the enjoyment of a healthy and balanced environment, as contemplated in the Political Constitution. ***The possibility of restoring the concession or the impossibility of doing so by virtue of being an absolute or relative nullity, is not part of the object of the writ of amparo, but rather is an issue that must be determined in the administrative area or in ordinary jurisdiction****.* The decision on the amparo whose clarification is requested has one singular and specific effect and objective, without being able to rule upon what decisions or actions based upon the resolution the Administration must adopt after the decision. The decision resolving the amparo, in accordance with its factual records and applicable legal rules, [does not] contemplate the determination of the absolute or relative nature of the errors or omissions contained in the concession; that determination is not within the jurisdiction of this court, since the possibility of correcting or rectifying a defect of legal transgression, or the impossibility of doing so, is an issue that must be resolved in compliance with the definitions and limits contained in ordinary legislation. The nature of these procedural defects, when applying the traditional terminology in relation to relative or absolute errors, is that they are conceptual categories whose application corresponds to the processes developed before the ordinary jurisdiction. For this reason, this motion is to be rejected in every respect.53\n\nRER-Ubico 1, \u00b6 76.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision No. 2007-7973 (7 June 2007), Exh. **C-0164**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision No. 2007-7973 (7 June 2007), Whereas I and II (emphasis added), Exh. **C-0164**.\n\n87.\n\nOn 31 October 2007, the MINAE granted Mr. Pacheco\u2019s 2002 challenge against Industrias Infinito\u2019s 2002 Concession, on the basis of the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s 2004 finding that the 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution.54\n\nResolution No. R-613-2007-MINAE (31 October 2007), Exh. **R-0079**.\n\n88.\n\nOn 1 January 2008, the new Code of Contentious Administrative Procedure, entered into force.55 This Code allowed individuals with diffuse interests to challenge the legality of administrative acts before the Contentious Administrative Tribunal (\u201c**TCA**\u201d).\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 189.\n\n89.\n\nOn 4 February 2008, the SETENA approved a revised EIA.56\n\nResolution No. 170-2008-SETENA (4 February 2008), Exh. **C-0170**.\n\n90.\n\nOn 18 March 2008, President Arias issued a decree repealing the 2002 Moratorium, which entered into force on 4 June 2008.57\n\nDecree No. 34492-MINAE (18 March 2008), Exh. **C-0172**.\n\n91.\n\nOn 21 April 2008, President Arias and the MINAE granted Industrias Infinito an exploitation concession (the \u201c**2008 Concession**\u201d or the \u201c**Concession**\u201d), using the administrative law concept of \u201cconversion\u201d *(i.e.,* the previous annulled concession is converted into a valid one).58 Industrias Infinito had requested that its 2002 Concession be cured through the concept of *saneamiento,* but the Government deemed that it was more appropriate to convert it.59 It is undisputed that a conversion does not reinstate the original concession (as would be the case with a *saneamiento),* but creates a new concession.60\n\nResolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE (21 April 2008), Exh. **C-0176**.\n\nLetter from Industrias Infinito to the DGM (30 May 2007), Exh. **C-0527**; Resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE (21 April 2008), Second Whereas, p. 19 (PDF) (English), p. 40 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0176**.\n\nCER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6 67; RER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 109, Table 5; General Law of Public Administration, Law No. 6227 (5 February 1978), Article 189, Exh. **C-0014**.\n\n92.\n\nOn 13 October 2008, President Arias designated the Crucitas Project as one of national interest.61\n\nExecutive Decree No. 34801-MINAET (13 October 2008), Exh. **C-0196**.\n\n93.\n\nOn 17 October 2008, the National System of Areas Conservation (the \u201c**SINAC**\u201d)62 authorized the logging of trees on the land of the Crucitas Project.63 Industrias Infinito commenced logging that same day.64\n\nIn Spanish: *Sistema Nacional de \u00c1reas de Conservaci\u00f3n.*\n\nResolution No. 244-2008-SCH (17 October 2008), Exh. **C-0197**.\n\nR-Mem.

Accordingly, when the Government granted Industrias Infinito the 2008 Concession, this was necessarily a new concession, which thus violated the 2002 Moratorium, then in force.85 The TCA also found that the Concession\u2019s conversion had violated the principle of non-derogability of rules (\u201c*principio de inderogabilidad singular de la norma*\u201d), pursuant to which the Government may not override a general rule through a specific act.86 Further, as discussed *infra* in Section V.C (discussing the Respondent\u2019s objection of illegality), the TCA also declared that the 2008 Concession had other legal and technical flaws, and held that Industrias Infinito had engaged in *\u201cfraude de ley.*\u201d87\n\nRER-Ubico 1 \u00b6 89, citing Contentious-Administrative Procedural Code, Law No. 8508 (28 April 2006) (\u201c**CPCA**\u201d), Article 111(1), Exh. **R-0082**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Exh. **C-0239**.

In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal used the term \u201cLegislative Moratorium.\u201d Having reviewed this law in the context of the merits, it finds the term Legislative Mining Ban more appropriate.\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 1 (amending Article 8 of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 1 (amending Article 8 of the Mining Code) (English), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 2 (adding a new Article 8 bis to the Mining Code) (English), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\n105.\n\nOn 18 January 2011, Industrias Infinito filed a request for cassation of the 2010 TCA Decision before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court, which had the effect of staying the challenged decision.95\n\nSubmissions of Industrias Infinito S.A. to the Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), File No. 08-1282-1027-CA (18 January 2011), Exh. **C-0248**.\n\n106.\n\nOn 10 February 2011, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban entered into force.96\n\nThe Parties differ as to the date on which the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban came into force. While the Respondent alleges that it was 10 February 2011 (R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 141), the Claimant states that it was 11 February 2011 (C-CM Jur., \u00b6 128, citing CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 201). In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the record suggests that the correct date is 10 February 2011: the Amendment to the Mining Code (Exh. **C-0238**) states that it becomes effective on the date of its publication, and the date of publication appears to have been 10 February 2011. In any event, this discrepancy has no impact on the Parties\u2019 arguments.\n\n107.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to declare that the 2010 TCA Decision was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s earlier decisions, in particular the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision.97\n\nRER-Ubico 1, \u00b6 112; Unconstitutionality Action, Industrias Infinito to the Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber) (11 November 2011), Exh. **C-0259**.\n\n108.\n\nOn 30 November 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court denied Industrias Infinito\u2019s cassation request, and upheld the main conclusions of the 2010 TCA Decision (the \u201c**2011 Administrative Chamber Decision**\u201d).98 In particular, it upheld the TCA\u2019s decisions on *res judicata,* non-derogability of rules, nullity of the 2002 Concession and applicability of the 2002 Moratorium.99 It did not pronounce on the TCA\u2019s findings on technical flaws and *fraude de ley.100*\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 267-286; Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas XIV-XVIII, LVI, LVIII-LIX, Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nAccording to Dr. Le\u00f3n, it did not do so because its previous holdings were sufficient to annul the relevant administrative acts.

SCOPE OF THIS DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nAs agreed by the Parties and reflected in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1, these proceedings have been bifurcated between jurisdiction and merits.\n\n120.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed all of the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections (whether they went to jurisdiction or admissibility), with the exception of the following, which were deferred to the present phase:\n\na. Whether the Claimant\u2019s investment complies with Article I(g) of the BIT (more specifically, whether it is an investment made in accordance with Costa Rican law). This objection was first raised by APREFLOFAS, but was subsequently endorsed by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial.117\n\nb. Whether the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because the claims are time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations contained in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal also deferred to the merits phase the discussion whether this objection goes to jurisdiction or admissibility, should it become relevant.118\n\nc. Whether the Claimant can invoke the Most Favored Nation (\u201c**MFN**\u201d) clause provided in Article IV of the BIT to \u201ccircumvent\u201d the jurisdictional flaws in its case. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal noted that this objection only remained relevant with respect to the time bar objection. As the Claimant invokes the MFN clause on an alternative basis, the Tribunal will address the MFN argument only if it upholds this latter objection.119\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 135-140; R-CM Merits, Section III.C.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 174, Sections IV.C.4.b and IV.C.4.c.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 360-362.\n\n121.\n\nFurther, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held that the application of Section III(1) of Annex I of the BIT was a matter of merits, not jurisdiction.120 As the Tribunal explained in that Decision, this provision \u201cdoes not relate to the State\u2019s consent to arbitrate, nor to whether a claim can be heard or not; it relates to whether a particular measure has or has not breached the BIT.\u201d121 The Tribunal will deal with this provision at the end of the merits review, if it finds that any of the claims on the merits are founded.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 358.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n122.\n\nThis Award first addresses the Respondent\u2019s remaining preliminary objections. To the extent they are dismissed, it will then address the merits of the dispute.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION / ADMISSIBILITY**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. L****aw Applicable to Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nAs was noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction, it is undisputed that (i) jurisdiction is governed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and by the BIT;122 (ii) the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is governed by the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (\u201c**VCLT**\u201d);123 and (iii) the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.124\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 118.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 119.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 120.\n\n**B. O****verview of the Parties\u2019 Positions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the following grounds:\n\na. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis,* because the Claimant\u2019s investment was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rica\u2019s laws as required by Article I(g) of the BIT. While the Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant has made an investment in Costa Rica, it argues that the 2008 Concession was obtained by fraud and misrepresentation, was grossly defective under Costa Rican law and may have been procured by corruption.125\n\nb. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* because the claims are time-barred pursuant to the three-year limitation period imposed by Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. This is because the Claimant acquired knowledge of the alleged breach and of the damage it caused when the 2010 TCA Decision was issued on 24 November 2010, *i.e.,* prior to the cut-off date of 6 February 2011.126\n\nc. Should the Tribunal find that the claims are barred under Article XII(3)(c), the Claimant cannot invoke the MFN clause to attempt to circumvent this finding by relying on a more favorable temporal limitation provision in another treaty. The Claimant has failed to show how it has suffered from less favorable treatment, and Article XII of the BIT contains jurisdictional requirements that cannot be bypassed by operation of the MFN clause. The BIT\u2019s MFN clause does not explicitly encompass dispute resolution, but the majority view is that MFN clauses do not apply to dispute settlement.127\n\nR-CM Merits, Section III.C.\n\nR-CM Merits, Section III.A.\n\nR-CM Merits, Section III.B.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are meritless:\n\na. With respect to the objections *ratione materiae and voluntatis,* the Claimant submits that its investment falls within the scope of Article I(g) of the BIT, because (i) it was valid at the time it was acquired, which is the relevant time to determine legality; (ii) any breaches of Costa Rican law were not sufficiently serious to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction, and are in any event primarily attributable to the State itself; (iii) the Respondent is estopped from arguing illegality of measures issued by its own officials; and (iv) there is no evidence whatsoever of corruption.128\n\nb. In connection with the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione temporis,* the evidence shows that the Claimant knew, and could only have known, that the Respondent breached the BIT and that Infinito had suffered damages on 30 November 2011, *i.e*., the date on which the Administrative Chamber annulled the resolutions restoring the Claimant\u2019s exploitation concession and other key permits, and on which the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban for the first time made it impossible for the Claimant to apply for another updated exploitation concession.129\n\nc. Finally, even if the Tribunal were to find that the claims are time-barred under Article XII(3)(c), the Claimant submits that Article IV(a) of the BIT (which includes an MFN clause) permits it to benefit from more favorable dispute resolution mechanisms under the Respondent\u2019s bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and the Republic of Korea that contain no temporal limitations.130\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 381.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 382.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 488-494.\n\n**C. D****oes the Claimant Own or Control an Investment in Accordance with Costa Rican Law?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nDuring the jurisdictional phase, the Respondent\u2019s position was that the evidence was insufficient to argue that \u201cthe entirety of Infinito\u2019s investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other malfeasance.\u201d131 However, in its Counter-Memorial, it alleged that \u201cfresh evidence suggesting that the Concession was indeed procured by corruption has come to light since the Hearing on Jurisdiction. Having previously reserved its rights in respect of this issue, Costa Rica now exercises those rights and objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on this basis.\u201d132\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6 337.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 296.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position during this phase has been that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s entire case because the Claimant\u2019s 2008 Concession was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law, as required under Article I(g) of the BIT. The Respondent thus argues that the Claimant\u2019s investment falls outside the scope of the BIT\u2019s protection and Costa Rica\u2019s consent to arbitration. Consequently, the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis.*133\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 297.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument is essentially the following: Article I(g) of the BIT expressly requires that the investment be owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law (a). The Claimant did not own or control an investment in accordance with Costa Rican law (b).\n\n**a. Article I(g) of the BIT Requires that the Investment Be Owned or Controlled in Accordance with Costa Rican Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nAs noted in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the BIT expressly requires that investments must be \u201cowned or controlled\u201d in accordance with Costa Rican law.134 The Respondent submits that \u201c[i]t is uncontroversial and well established in investment law that where a treaty contains a provision requiring investments to be in accordance with a host-State\u2019s laws, investments which are illegal under that law are not protected by the BIT and fall outside the scope of the State\u2019s consent to arbitration.\u201d135 Relying on *Anderson,* the Respondent further submits that, if an investment is not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law, it will not qualify as an investment under the BIT.136\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 301; Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 138, 235(iii).\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 298, citing *inter alia* *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

First, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* because the substantive protections of the BIT apply only to investments as defined under the BIT.137 Second, it also lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis,* because Costa Rica\u2019s consent to arbitration under the BIT applies only to \u201cinvestors\u201d who own or control an \u201cinvestment\u201d as defined under the BIT.138 Third, the investment falls outside the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration, since the latter only applies to a legal dispute arising out of an investment.139\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 301.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 301.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 302, relying on *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v.

The terms \u201cowned\u201d or \u201ccontrolled\u201d do not relate to a particular point in time (as opposed to the terms \u201cmade\u201d, \u201cestablished\u201d or \u201cadmitted\u201d).141 Consequently, the legality requirement applies throughout the life of an investment.142 The Respondent relies on the wording of Article I(g) of the BIT and denies that *Vannessa Ventures* and *Copper Mesa* support the Claimant\u2019s position.143\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 304.\n\nR-Rej.

The Claimant Did Not Own or Control an Investment in Accordance with Costa Rican Law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant did not own or control an investment in accordance with Costa Rican law because (i) the Claimant obtained its investment through deceitful conduct (\u201c*fraude de ley*\"); (ii) the Claimant\u2019s 2008 Concession suffered from other irredeemable legal defects; and (iii) there are indicia that the Claimant\u2019s investment was procured through corruption.\n\n***(i) The Claimant Obtained Its Investment Through Deceitful Conduct (\u201cFraude de Ley\u201d)***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, as declared by the 2010 TCA Decision and confirmed by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2008 Concession was illegally obtained through misrepresentation to Costa Rican officials, which amounted to a legal fraud *(fraude de ley)* under Costa Rican law.154 Relying on its legal expert, Dr. Le\u00f3n, the Respondent submits that a *\u201cfraude de ley\"* occurs \u201cwhen acts are carried out under the guise of lawful conduct, but are aimed at obtaining unlawful effects.\u201d155\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 311; R-Rej.

The Respondent explains that the 2008 Concession suffered from at least the following fundamental legal defects:162\n\na. The grant of the 2008 Concession was illegal due to the application of the 2002 Moratorium. The attempt to apply the principle of conversion to the concession previously held by Industrias Infinito was invalid because such concession had been annulled and declared void *ab initio* more than six years before.163\n\nb. The grant of the 2008 Concession breached the principle of non-derogability of general administrative regulations by individual, specific administrative acts.164\n\nc. The 2008 Concession and related approvals breached numerous environmental protection laws, in particular:\n\ni. The changes introduced by Industrias Infinito to the Project in December 2007, after obtaining approval of its EIA in December 2005, were significant, and would have required an additional EIA to have been carried out.165\n\nii. The mandatory technical analysis of Industrias Infinito\u2019s proposed changes to the mining Project in December 2007 were not carried out.166\n\niii. SETENA\u2019s approval of Industrias Infinito\u2019s modified EIA in February 2008 was invalid because it was based on the original EIA approval of December 2005, which had a validity of two years and thus expired in December 2007.167\n\niv. SETENA failed to hold a public hearing for the Project in accordance with the requirements of the Organic Law of the Environment, which imposes on the State an obligation to encourage public participation when actions could affect the environment.168\n\nv. Industrias Infinito\u2019s land-use permit was invalid, because it failed to consider that the area in question included protected species of tree; it incorrectly identified the species of tree in the area and it depended on the declaration of national interest in relation to the Project, which the TCA declared void.169\n\nvi. The permit for change in land use was invalid, since it was based on the 2008 Concession that was declared void.170\n\nvii. When providing its approval for the modified EIA requested by Industrias Infinito in December 2007, SETENA did not carry out the required cost-benefit analysis under Costa Rican law.171\n\nviii. When applying for the EIA approval in 2002, Industrias Infinito failed to disclose the existence of a public road in the area where the tailings pond for the mine was planned to be built. It did so again when applying for modifications to the Project in December 2007.172\n\nix. SETENA relied upon certain reports provided by Industrias Infinito that were not duly signed and stamped by the chemical engineer from the Professional Association of Chemical Engineers.173\n\nd. The decree that the Project was in the national interest was invalid, both in terms of procedure and motivation.174\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 332-333; R-Rej.

Hence, they are sufficiently serious to make the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment ineligible for the protection of the BIT.\n\n143.\n\nNor is the Respondent estopped from arguing that the Claimant\u2019s investment was illegal as a result of these deficiencies. Although the TCA held that Costa Rican authorities shared responsibility for the legal defects, Costa Rica\u2019s judiciary found that the 2008 Concession had been illegally granted and invalidated it. Relying on the actions taken by Costa Rica\u2019s judiciary as well as the commencement of criminal and disciplinary proceedings against certain Costa Rican officials involved in illegally granting the 2008 Concession, the Respondent asserts that it did not accept the defects in the Claimant\u2019s investment.175\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 354.\n\n144.\n\nWith respect to the responsibility for the defects and the Claimant\u2019s arguments that they were attributable to the Costa Rican authorities, the Respondent submits that the reference to *SPP* is inapposite*.* While that tribunal held that the complicity of the Egyptian authorities in the alleged illegality defeated the respondent\u2019s objection, the extract cited by the Claimant makes no mention of the seriousness of the illegality, and is thus irrelevant.176\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 303, referring to *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v.

The Respondent relies in particular on *Chevron,* and on *Cortec,* according to which a tribunal should \u201caccept the findings of local courts\u201d as long as there are no gross deficiencies.178\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 308-309.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent further denies that the support for the Claimant\u2019s mining project expressed by its officials now estops it from pleading illegality. That support did not amount to a representation that the 2008 Concession was exempt from judicial scrutiny. In any event, the estoppel doctrine does not mean that statements or acts of the executive can supersede court decisions, the judiciary being the ultimate arbiter of Costa Rican law pursuant to Costa Rica\u2019s Constitution.\n\n149.\n\nIn addition, Costa Rica stresses that the cases on which the Claimant relies in support of its estoppel argument, such as *Kardassopoulos* and *ADC,* were solely concerned with endorsements by the executive branch of a State and did not involve any contrary ruling from the judiciary. They are thus distinguishable. Moreover, Costa Rica considers that it cannot be estopped from asserting illegality where the Claimant itself fraudulently concealed the illegality, a rule that was confirmed in *Fraport I* and in *Arif.* Finally, for the Respondent, the issue of estoppel does not arise in respect of investments that, because of their nature and associated risks, may be made subject to special regulations, such as investments in open-pit mining.180\n\nR-Rej.

In particular, it noted that there were ongoing criminal investigations in respect of the Claimant\u2019s investment, and thus it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute.181\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 355-365.\n\n151.\n\nHowever, in its Rejoinder, the Respondent expressly withdrew this objection:\n\n[T]he investigation of possible bribery resulting from the donation by the Claimant\u2019s shareholder Ronald Mannix to former President Mr Arias\u2019 foundation has been discontinued following the decision of the Costa Rican Criminal Court that specific charges against Mr Arias (but not others) were time-barred. Accordingly, Costa Rica is no longer pursuing its jurisdictional objection on the basis of the indicia of corruption in respect of the Claimant\u2019s investment.182\n\nR-Rej.

The Assessment of Legality of an Investment Focuses on the Time When the Investment Was Acquired**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent bears the burden of proving that the Claimant breached the legality requirement under Article I(g) of the BIT. The applicable standard of proof for assertions of illegality, fraud and corruption requires clear and convincing evidence.183\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 389, relying on *Waguih,* where the tribunal held that \u201cthe applicable standard of proof is greater than the balance of probabilities but less than beyond reasonable doubt.\u201d *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v.

There Was No Illegality at the Time Infinito Initially Acquired Its Investment**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s contention that its investment was legal when it was initially made in 2000. Since there was no illegality associated with the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of Industrias Infinito in 2000, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is trying to argue that Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession was actually acquired in 2008.188 However, the Claimant argues, Industrias Infinito\u2019s 2008 Concession is the same investment as its 2002 Concession, which meets the legality requirement under Article I(g) because there were no legal defects when it was first acquired in 2001, which Costa Rica admitted at the hearing on jurisdiction. For that reason alone, this jurisdictional challenge should be dismissed.189\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 396.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 390, 396.\n\n156.\n\nAs explained by Ms. Araya, Industrias Infinito\u2019s right to an exploitation concession crystallized once it had proven the existence of an exploitable deposit while an exploration permit holder. The resolutions issued in 2001 and 2008 with respect to the concession are part of the same investment.190\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 396, citing CER-Araya 1, \u00b6\u00b6 71-120.\n\n157.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant observes that the Respondent relies on the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision to argue that the 2002 and 2008 exploitation concession resolutions are different instruments and that Industrias Infinito never owned a valid mining concession under Costa Rican law. The Claimant submits that this argument should be rejected for two reasons. First, its investments in Costa Rica are not limited to the resolutions granting the exploitation concession; as at the time the Claimant acquired Industrias Infinito, Industrias Infinito held an exploration permit granting a right under the Mining Code to obtain an exploitation concession and that right was not unlawful. Second, the argument is based on *ex post facto* declarations of invalidity by the Constitutional Chamber in 2004 and by the Administrative Chamber in 2011, based on laws that changed after the investment was made.191 The Claimant refers to *Arif*, in which the tribunal held that the State\u2019s use of a declaration by its own judiciary of the illegality of the claimant\u2019s investment under its law was formalistic in that it relied on a judicially declared invalidity that applied retrospectively to the date of the investment.192\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 397.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 398, citing *Arif,* \u00b6 374, Exh. **CL-0014**.\n\n**c. Any Subsequent Illegality Cannot Deprive the Tribunal of Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, even if the Tribunal were to consider events that post-date the investment to assess its jurisdiction, any breaches of Costa Rican law that occurred during the life of the Crucitas Project were not sufficiently serious to warrant the Tribunal declining jurisdiction. In any event, the vast majority of the illegalities identified by the TCA, on which Costa Rica relies, were attributable to the State itself and not to Infinito or Industrias Infinito. As a result, they cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction (i).193 The Claimant adds that, in any event, the Respondent is estopped from arguing that the resolution granting the exploitation concession and related approvals were illegal (ii). Finally, the Claimant maintains that there is no evidence of corruption (iii).\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 399.\n\n***(i) The Breaches of Costa Rican Law Alleged by the Respondent Do Not Meet the Illegality Standard***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, to deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction, any breaches of Costa Rican law must be serious and attributable to the Claimant. This principle is well-established in international law and was acknowledged by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction. Cases of illegality have resulted in an investor being deprived of treaty protections only in the event of corruption or forgery, fraudulent misrepresentation, and serious breaches of the host State\u2019s law.194\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 399-404.\n\n160.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this standard is not met here. There was no deceitful conduct by Industrias Infinito, and the remaining issues identified by the TCA would not have prevented the Project from proceeding.\n\n161.\n\nThe basis for the Respondent\u2019s argument of deceitful conduct are the TCA\u2019s findings that Industrias Infinito committed *fraude de ley. Fraude de ley* is a civil and administrative law concept in Costa Rica, not a criminal law one.195 According to the Claimant, none of the TCA\u2019s findings of *fraude de ley* amount to deceitful conduct by Industrias Infinito:\n\na. The TCA first found that Industrias Infinito\u2019s interpretation of its rights under the Mining Code as automatically granting it the right to an exploitation concession \u201cinsult[ed] the intelligence of this Court, violates the law, and results in a process of fraudulent abuse of law.\u201d196 For the Claimant, \u201ca legal interpretation, shared by all relevant Costa Rican authorities over a number of years, cannot possibly be construed as fraud or an intent to deceive at all, let alone one which is sufficiently serious to warrant depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\u201d197\n\nb. The second finding characterized as *fraude de ley* was based on the fact that the Administration used the mechanism of conversion to restore the exploitation concession in an attempt to avoid the 2002 Moratorium. That mechanism was chosen by President Arias and Minister Dobles on the advice of the MINAE, even though Industrias Infinito had requested a different mechanism, *i.e.* convalidation. According to the Claimant, \u201c[t]his cannot possibly be construed as deceitful conduct on the part of [Industrias Infinito], or even deceitful conduct at all.\u201d198\n\nc. The third finding of *fraude de ley* was linked to the fact that, in its modified EIA, Industrias Infinito stated that the extraction depth of the mine was meters below the surface, rather than meters above sea level. For the Claimant, there is no evidence that Industrias Infinito had any intent to deceive or mislead SETENA. Had SETENA required the information stated in a different form to properly assess it, it could have requested that information. SETENA found no adverse impacts and approved the modifications, following which Industrias Infinito presented the revision to its feasibility study to the DGM, with the increased extraction depth. In 2010, the Constitutional Chamber held that SETENA\u2019s approval of the EIA modification had been compliant with Costa Rica\u2019s constitutional guarantee of a clean and healthy environment.199\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 405-408.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), p. 82 (English), p. 82 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.

According to the Claimant, there was no basis for this finding, as the road was clearly identified in all Project drawings, as were mitigation measures.200\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 416.\n\n163.\n\nIn any event, so says the Claimant, the Administrative Chamber did not uphold the TCA\u2019s findings of *\u201cfraude de ley\"* or other allegedly deceitful conduct, and instead ruled on the narrower grounds that the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Crucitas Project.201\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 415.\n\n164.\n\nAs to the remaining \u201cirredeemable legal defects\u201d allegedly identified by the TCA, the Claimant contends that none would have prevented Industrias Infinito from proceeding with the Crucitas Project and obtaining a new resolution granting it an exploitation concession, had it not been barred by the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. Moreover, these legal defects were (with limited exceptions) attributable to the State itself.202 They included actions by President Arias and Minister Dobles, *i.e.* the issuance of the 2008 resolution granting Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession and the alleged failure to hold a public hearing, to conduct a sufficient cost-benefit analysis, and to allow the clearance of a larger area of forest than had been permitted by SETENA;203 several actions of SETENA, namely the decision not to require a full EIA to be completed in respect of the project modifications, the supposed failure to conduct sufficient analysis of the EIA modification proposal, the decision not to require a public hearing in respect of the EIA modifications, and the alleged failure to carry out a sufficient cost-benefit analysis, and SINAC\u2019s supposed failure to take into account that the area contained protected species of tree.204\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 419-421.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 421.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 421.\n\n165.\n\nInfinito further contends that these legal defects were not sufficiently serious to justify depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Mere technical defects do not meet the illegality standard, particularly where they are the result of the *ex post facto* application by the courts of laws that changed after the investment was made. The same applies to Industrias Infinito\u2019s alleged failure to disclose the existence of a public road, and reports relied on by SETENA that were not signed and stamped by a chemical engineer from the Professional Association of Chemical Engineers.205\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 420-424.\n\n***(ii) Costa Rica is Estopped from Arguing that the Resolution Granting the Exploitation Concession and Related Approvals Was Illegal***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant submits that, given its conduct during the relevant time, the Respondent is estopped from arguing that the resolution granting the exploitation concession and related approvals was illegal. From 2001 onwards, the Claimant, Industrias Infinito and the Government all proceeded on the understanding that the exploitation concession and related approvals were valid. This remained true following the enactment of the 2002 Moratorium and the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision. Costa Rican officials and courts repeatedly concluded over a decade that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Project. The doctrine of estoppel bars the Respondent from now claiming that purported technical and legal errors by Costa Rican officials should deprive the Claimant of the BIT\u2019s protection. In support, the Claimant relies on *Desert Line, ADC,* and *Arif.*206\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 425-427, citing *Desert Line Projects LLC v.

Specifically, there is no evidence that a donation was made by a principal investor in Infinito to the Fundaci\u00f3n Arias Para La Paz.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Tribunal had previously indicated that there was insufficient evidence to make out this claim. As new evidence, Costa Rica has invoked the reopening of the investigation against President Arias regarding this alleged donation, which is no proof of corruption. The Respondent and APREFLOFAS also point to criminal charges against Costa Rican officials in connection with the Crucitas Project. However, so says the Claimant, there have been no final convictions, except for the one against Minister Dobles, for *prevaricato,* which was overturned on appeal.207\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 428-434.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent objects that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione voluntatis* over the entire dispute because the Concession was not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law, as required under Article I(g) of the BIT.208\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 297.\n\n170.\n\nArticle XII of the BIT, which contains Costa Rica\u2019s offer of arbitration, refers to \u201c[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach [...].\u201d209\n\nBIT, Article XII(1), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n171.\n\nAccordingly, jurisdiction depends, *inter alia,* on the existence of a dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party. An investor is defined in Article I(h) as a natural person or an enterprise \u201cwho owns or controls an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\u201d210 An investment, in turn, is defined in Article I(g) of the BIT in the following words:211\n\n(g) \u2018investment\u2019 means any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property and any related property rights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n\n(ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in an enterprise;\n\n(iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value;\n\n(iv) goodwill;\n\n(v) intellectual property rights;\n\n(vi) rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources;\n\nbut does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.\n\n[...].\n\nBIT, Article I(h), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\nBIT, Article I(g), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is well established that, where a treaty contains a legality requirement, as is the case here, investments which are illegal are not protected and fall outside the scope of the State\u2019s consent to arbitration.212 The Respondent thus argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* because the BIT applies only to investments as defined under the BIT, *i.e.* investments that meet the legality requirement. Similarly, it asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, because the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration only covers \u201cinvestors\u201d and \u201cinvestments\u201d as defined under the BIT, which again implies legality.213\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 298, citing *inter alia* *Fraport I,* \u00b6 339, Exh. **CL-0207**; *Inceysa,* \u00b6 207, Exh. **RL-0183**; *Salini,* \u00b6 46, Exh. **RL-0184**.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 301-302.\n\n173.\n\nDepending on the content of the treaty, illegality can affect jurisdiction, admissibility or the merits of the claims. Here, the legality requirement forms part of the definition of investment. Consequently, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, to qualify as a protected investment under the BIT, the Claimant\u2019s investment must be an asset owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rica\u2019s laws. If it is not, then the Tribunal will lack jurisdiction. Indeed, the conditions for jurisdiction as defined under the BIT will not be fulfilled and, by the same token, the requirement for consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention will not be met.\n\n174.\n\nAs recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimant asserts that it owns or controls the following assets in the territory of Costa Rica: \u201c(i) its shares in Industrias Infinito; (ii) the money it invested in Industrias Infinito through intercompany loans; (iii) the exploitation concession; (iv) the pre-existing mining rights underlying the exploitation concession; (v) the other approvals for the Crucitas [P]roject; (vi) the physical assets associated with the [P]roject, including the half-built mining infrastructure; and (vii) the intangible assets associated with the [P]roject.\u201d214 At the time, the Respondent did not contest this.215 However, as APREFLOFAS had alleged that the investment had been procured by corruption, the Tribunal deferred the matter to the merits.216\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 175(b), citing C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 219.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 175(b).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 139-140.\n\n175.\n\nIn the course of the merits phase, the Respondent objected that the investment had not been made in accordance with Costa Rican law. This objection centers exclusively on whether the Claimant owned or controlled the 2008 Concession (and related approvals) in accordance with Costa Rican law. As noted above, the Respondent argues that Industrias Infinito obtained the 2008 Concession and related approvals through deceitful conduct, and that the 2008 Concession suffered from other irredeemable legal defects.217 Yet, under the terms of the Treaty, it is not on the 2008 Concession that the Tribunal must focus for purposes of establishing its jurisdiction. The 2008 Concession does not qualify as an investment of the Claimant under Article I(g) of the Treaty. Indeed, it is not an \u201casset owned or controlled [...] directly\u201d by the Claimant, as it is owned or controlled by Industrias Infinito. In other words, it is an asset owned indirectly. Yet, it does not fall within the scope of the Treaty\u2019s definition, which requires an \u201casset owned or controlled [...] indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a ***third State*** [...].\u201d218 Industrias Infinito is an enterprise incorporated in the host State and thus does not qualify as an enterprise of a third State. The same applies to the pre-existing mining rights, other approvals for the Crucitas Project, and any physical or intangible assets owned by Industrias Infinito and alleged to constitute Infinito\u2019s investments.\n\n*Supra,* Section V.C. 1. At one point, the Respondent alleged that there were indications that the 2008 Concession was procured through corruption, but it has since withdrawn that claim. *Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 150-151.\n\nBIT, Article I(g), Exh. **C-0001** (emphasis added).\n\n176.\n\nIn light of the Treaty\u2019s text, the asset that qualifies as an investment for purposes of establishing jurisdiction are the Claimant\u2019s shares in Industrias Infinito, which the Claimant owns indirectly, through Crucitas (Barbados) Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of Barbados, *i.e.*, an enterprise of a third State.219 As a result, the shares are the investment to which, according to the Treaty, the legality requirement attaches. Seen in this light, the Claimant\u2019s shares in Industrias Infinito are far from being an \u201cancillary investment,\u201d as the Respondent contends. To the contrary, it is the Claimant\u2019s main investment, without which it would have no access to jurisdiction under the Treaty.\n\nCER-FTI Consulting 1, n. 15. While the Claimant has also referred to moneys it has invested in Industrias Infinito, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to refer to these if ownership to the shares is established. In the event that these funds were still owned by Infinito and had not passed into the ownership of its subsidiary at the relevant time, the Tribunal notes that, as observed in *Inmaris,* for purposes of jurisdiction it need not examine whether each and every element of an investment meets the requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention; it \u201cneed only determine the existence of a covered investment in the transaction as a whole.\u201d *Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH and others v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2010 (\u201c***Inmaris***\"), \u00b6 92, Exh. **CL-0258**.\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent has not disputed that the Claimant owns or controls its shares in Industrias Infinito in accordance with Costa Rican law. Nor has it argued that the Claimant acquired these shares illegally, or that its ownership or control of these shares has been vitiated in any way. As to the allegations of corruption, the record is clear that they concerned \u201cmatters that happened after the initial investment was made.\u201d220 On this basis, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s allegations that the 2008 Concession and related approvals were acquired illegally or were affected by legal flaws are irrelevant for purposes of jurisdiction.\n\nTr. Jur. Day 2 (ENG), 421:5-6 (Mr. Evseev).\n\n178.\n\nThere being no dispute that the Claimant has made an indirect investment in Costa Rica *(i.e.,* its shares in Industrias Infinito) in accordance with its laws, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s illegality objection. For reasons of procedural economy, it finds it unnecessary to address the Parties\u2019 conceptual disagreements as to the temporal and subject matter scopes of the legality requirement found at Article I(g), or their arguments on estoppel. This being said, as the corruption allegations made by APREFLOFAS raise an issue of international public policy, which the Tribunal must address *ex officio*, the Tribunal will review whether the acquisition of this investment was tainted by corruption.\n\n179.\n\nAs noted above, both the Respondent and APREFLOFAS have alleged that there are indicia that the Claimant\u2019s investment was procured through corruption,221 and that consequently, the Claimant\u2019s investment \u201cfalls outside both the scope of the BIT\u2019s protections and Costa Rica\u2019s consent to arbitration.\u201d222 The Respondent has since withdrawn this objection, with the justification that \u201cthe investigation of possible bribery resulting from the donation by the Claimant\u2019s shareholder Ronald Mannix to former President Arias\u2019 foundation has been discontinued following the decision of the Costa Rican Criminal Court that specific charges against Mr Arias (but not others) were time-barred.\u201d223\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 297.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 297.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 239, fn. 404. *See also* R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 208-209.\n\n180.\n\nIn spite of this withdrawal, the Tribunal will address this corruption allegation for the reasons mentioned above. First of all, the Tribunal notes that the allegations of corruption by the Respondent and APREFLOFAS relate to the acquisition of the 2008 Concession, which was granted during President Arias\u2019s administration.224 As the Respondent admitted during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the allegations of corruption concern \u201cmatters that happened after the initial investment was made,\u201d225 which the Tribunal understands to mean that they do not relate to the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of shares in Industrias Infinito. Hence, even if the corruption allegations were well-founded, *quod non,* this would not imply that the acquisition of the shares, which is the relevant investment for present purposes, was unlawful. It would mean that later conduct of the investor was tainted, which could be a defense on the merits, but not an obstacle to jurisdiction.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 363-365; APREFLOFAS's First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 15-21; APREFLOFAS's Second Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 9-15.\n\n*See* Tr. Jur. Day 2 (ENG), 421:5-6 (Mr. Evseev).\n\n181.\n\nIn any event, there are insufficient signals in the record that the 2008 Concession was obtained through corruption. In particular, APREFLOFAS and the Respondent were relying on an investigation against former President Oscar Arias and other officials involved in the granting of the Concession226 that has been discontinued.227 While it appears that the discontinuation decision was annulled and remanded to the first court for a *de novo* assessment,228 there is no indication that the charges against President Arias can proceed. Moreover, there is no element on record accrediting APREFLOFAS\u2019s suggestion that the Arias foundation received a USD 200,000 donation from one of the Claimant\u2019s investors. When assessing the record and reaching the findings just set out, the Tribunal has taken into consideration that it is notoriously difficult to prove corruption and that, as a result, tribunals tend to focus on circumstantial evidence, relying on indicia or red flags. Even adopting such less demanding standard of proof, it cannot conclude that the 2008 Concession was procured by corruption. As a consequence, it will not revert to this issue in the context of the merits, considering that the inquiry would not be different on the merits and that it has discharged its *ex officio* duty in matters of international public policy for purposes of jurisdiction and merits here.\n\nAPREFLOFAS's First Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10-14, 19-23; Accusation and Request to Open a Trial, Criminal Court of the Treasury, File No. 08-000012-033-PE (8 November 2012), Exh. **C-0278**; Criminal Court for Treasury and Public Service, II Judicial Circuit of San Jose, Case No. 08-000011-033-PE, Trial Order (5 May 2013), Exh. **NDP-001**; Criminal Trial's Tribunal, II Judicial Circuit of San Jose, Case No. 08-00011 -033-PE, Decision No. 32-2015 (28 January 2015), Exh. **NDP-002**.\n\nR-Rej.

It will consider the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the 2008 Concession suffered from legal defects or that Industrias Infinito otherwise breached Costa Rican administrative or environmental law when assessing the merits.\n\n**D. A****re The Claims Time-Barred under Article** **XII(3)(****C****)** **of the** **BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* as the Claimant\u2019s claims are time-barred, because the Claimant had actual or constructive knowledge of (a) the alleged breaches and (b) the fact that it had incurred loss or damage, before 6 February 2011.\n\n**a. The Claimant Had Actual or Constructive Knowledge of the Alleged Breaches Prior to 6 February 2011**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the evidence shows that the alleged breaches crystallized before the cut-off date and that the Claimant acquired knowledge of such breaches when the 2010 TCA Decision was issued on 24 November 2010, before the cut-off date.229\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 201.\n\n185.\n\nTo identify when a breach crystallizes, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should apply the approach taken by other tribunals when analyzing whether a claim falls within the temporal scope of a BIT.230 More specifically, the Tribunal should assess whether the distinct measures that are alleged to be in breach of the BIT were legally significant and distinct events from measures that occurred prior to the cut-off date, or whether the measures were deeply rooted in measures or events taking place before the cut-off date and did not have any separate effect, or bring about any fundamental change in relation to those earlier measures.231 The Respondent relies on *Spence,* which found that the investors had \u201cfailed to show [.] that the breaches that they allege are independently actionable breaches, separable from the pre-entry into force conduct in which they are deeply rooted.\u201d232 It further refers to case law that demonstrates that, where a State\u2019s overall conduct has affected an investor\u2019s rights and such conduct has consisted of actions, some of which have occurred before the cut-off date and some thereafter, the tribunal will not have jurisdiction over the acts post-dating the cut-off if the relevant legal and factual situation had already crystallized before that date.233 In other words, a claimant cannot invoke the last act in a chain or series of events, on the ground that the breach crystallized then, if in reality that act was not a distinct and legally significant event and brought about no separate effect or fundamental change to the *status quo ante.*234\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 204-206.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 205.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 207, citing *Spence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz, et al. v.

Instead, these simply maintained or confirmed the *status quo ante.235* Specifically, the legal and factual situation regarding the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment had already taken definite shape - and therefore crystallized - prior to 6 February 2011, as a consequence of the following two events: (i) the 2010 TCA Decision (issued on 24 November 2010, which annulled the 2008 Concession and related project approvals); and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratoria (which became effective as of 11 May 2010, and banned open-pit mining in Costa Rica).236 Indeed, it was the 2010 TCA Decision, as opposed to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which ordered the annulment of the 2008 Concession. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did nothing other than confirm the legality of the 2010 TCA Decision - no effects or specific orders were altered.237 Likewise, it was the 2010 Executive Moratoria that banned open-pit mining in Costa Rica. The legal and factual situation underlying the Claimant\u2019s complaint in relation to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had thus already crystallized prior to the cut-off date.238\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 215; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 335.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 216.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 217.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 218.\n\n187.\n\nBy contrast, the measures on which the Claimant predicates its BIT claims had no separate effect on the *status quo ante* that had already been shaped by the previous two measures (the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2010 Executive Moratoria). Essentially, the first three of the measures invoked by the Claimant (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision; the 2012 MINAET Resolution, and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision) did nothing more than confirm or maintain the annulment of the Concession, which had already occurred with the 2010 TCA Decision in November 2010, over two months before the cut-off date of 6 February 2011. The fourth measure (the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban) replicated the prior 2010 Executive Moratoria. Hence, the legal and factual situation on which the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims are based had already crystallized with the prior 2010 Executive Moratoria and the 2010 TCA Decision.239 As a result, such measures do not constitute distinct and legally significant events, and cannot form an independent or free-standing basis for Claimant\u2019s BIT claims.240\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 220-221.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 219.\n\n188.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent contends that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was not a distinct and legally significant event that was independently actionable under the BIT241 for the following reasons:\n\na. First, it did nothing more than confirm the findings of the 2010 TCA Decision, namely that the 2008 Concession should be annulled because it breached the 2002 Moratorium.242\n\nb. Second, even if the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision had never been issued, the Concession would have remained annulled (as a result of the 2010 TCA Decision). The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision therefore had no separate effect on the Claimant\u2019s investment from the 2010 TCA Decision. The Claimant relies on the award in *Rumeli* to argue that, where judicial measures are alleged to breach a treaty, it is only the final appeal court judgment that crystallizes the breach. However, the passage cited from that case has no bearing on the issue of when a particular breach crystallizes. Furthermore, \u201cas the tribunal\u2019s decision in *ST-AD* demonstrates, in instances in which a judicial appeal is decided after the cut-off date, but the appeal and the resulting appellate judgment are deeply rooted in a judgment rejecting the same arguments prior to the cut-off date, the resulting appellate judgment will not constitute a distinct and legally significant event capable of giving rise to a separately actionable breach.\u201d243 In the same vein, the Respondent argues that \u201c[t]he status of the 2008 Concession remained the same both before and after the 2011 Administrative Chamber [Decision].\u201d244\n\nc. Third, the operative part of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision does not refer to any annulment of the 2008 Concession. By contrast, the operative part of the 2010 TCA Decision expressly contains the decision to annul Industrias Infinito\u2019s rights.245\n\nd. Fourth, many of the Claimant\u2019s arguments to show that the 2008 Concession is valid were assessed solely by the TCA and not by the Administrative Chamber, since the latter \u201cexercised procedural economy.\u201d246\n\ne. Fifth, assuming that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision had upheld the Claimant\u2019s appeal, this would not have automatically reinstated the 2008 Concession. Indeed, the issue would have been remanded to the TCA.247\n\nf. Sixth, the Claimant does not dispute that the 2010 TCA Decision annulled the 2008 Concession. Rather, the Claimant is arguing that the decision only \u201cbecame firm\u201d with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.248\n\ng. Seventh, the Claimant did not carry out any mining activities following the 2010 TCA Decision. The Respondent argues that this shows that the \u201c2008 Concession and related approvals had been annulled [...].\u201d249\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 338.\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 350.\n\n189.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent contends that the 2012 MINAET Resolution was not a distinct and legally significant event that was independently actionable under the BIT because its only purpose was to implement the express instruction contained in the 2010 TCA Decision to the Executive, such instruction being the legal and logical consequence of the TCA having declared the 2008 Concession null and void. This resolution therefore cannot form the basis of a separate breach of the BIT.250 As Dr. Le\u00f3n explains, \u201cthe annulment of a concession and its cancellation [...] have the same effect: the termination of the concession.\u201d251 Further, the Respondent argues that the Claimant and its witness have recognized that Industrias Infinito no longer had any exploration permit or pre-existing mining rights since its exploration permit had expired on 18 September 1999.252\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 228; R-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 355.\n\n190.\n\nLikewise, the Respondent argues that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision was not a distinct and legally significant event that was independently actionable under the BIT. The Respondent recalls that, in that judgment, the Constitutional Chamber determined that it could not rule on the constitutionality of the 2010 TCA Decision because the Administrative Chamber had already rendered its decision. In any event, the Respondent submits that \u201c[a]ny ruling by the Constitutional Chamber on the constitutionality of the 2010 TCA Judgment in any event would have had no effect at all on the 2010 TCA Judgment\u2019s findings in relation to the legality of the concession, since such findings (which examined the legality, and not the constitutionality, of the 2008 Concession and related measures) would fall outside the competence of the Constitutional Chamber.\u201d253 In the alternative, the Respondent argues that the 2010 TCA Decision annulled the 2008 Concession on other grounds that were not part of the Claimant\u2019s *res judicata* defense.254\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 230.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 360.\n\n191.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the fourth measure (the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which the Respondent refers to as the Legislative Moratorium) was also not a distinct and legally significant event and cannot form an independent basis for a BIT claim. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban replicated the substance of the 2010 Executive Moratoria that had been issued by the executive branch prior to the cut-off date, and that had remained in full force and effect from the time of their enactment, and past the cut-off date. The Claimant was therefore subject to precisely the same constraints both before and after the cut-off date, which means *a fortiori* that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no separate effects or impact than those generated earlier by the 2010 Executive Moratoria. In other words, the 2010 Executive Moratoria already prevented the Claimant from applying for a new concession, which is the very grievance that the Claimant now complains of in relation to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. Thus, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban did not fundamentally change or shape the legal and factual situation that existed prior to 6 February 2011; it simply recast in legislative terms a legal limitation that already existed by virtue of the 2010 Executive Moratoria255\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 234-235; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 362-366.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant\u2019s position is contrary to its contemporaneous understanding of the 2010 Executive Moratoria. The Respondent submits that in its Quarterly Report of 30 September 2010, the Claimant stated that it had registered impairment charges of USD 309,000 and USD 450,000 with respect to its \u201cproperties impacted by the mining moratorium announced by the Costa Rican Government on May 8 2010 [*i.e.*, the date of the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree].\u201d256 Hence, the legal and factual situation on which the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims are based had already crystallized with the prior 2010 Executive Moratoria and the 2010 TCA Decision.257\n\nR-Rej.

The Claimant Had Actual or Constructive Knowledge of the Loss or Damage Caused Prior to the Cut-Off Date**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant had actual or constructive knowledge of the loss or damage it had suffered with the 2010 TCA Decision, *i.e.,* before the cut-off date.258 It denies that the relevant moment for the purposes of Article XII(3)(c) is the moment at which the investor \u201c[knows] its investment became \u2018substantially worthless\u2019,\u201d as suggested by the Claimant.259 Relying on various investment arbitration decisions, the Respondent argues that \u201cit is not necessary to show that the Claimant knew, or ought to have known, the exact magnitude of the loss it suffered in order to determine when it had knowledge of loss or damage for the purposes of a temporal limitation provision.\u201d260\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 240; R-Rej.

It notes that the Claimant\u2019s share price dropped by more than 50% immediately following the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision,261 and stresses that its quantum expert found that \u201c[f]rom a financial perspective, 24 November 2010 is the correct valuation date as that is the date that activity stopped and the investment should have been impaired on Infinito\u2019s books.\u201d262 The Respondent further argues that this loss results directly from the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision, and that the subsequent measures - the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2013 Constitutional Court Decision - did not cause any additional loss or damage because they did not alter the 2010 TCA Decision.263\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 241.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 240, citing RER-Credibility 1, \u00b6\u00b6 9(i), 72.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 243.\n\n195.\n\nThe same conclusion applies with regard to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. The Respondent argues that this Ban had no \u201cadditional or different impact on the Claimant beyond that which had already been caused by the 2010 Executive Moratoria\u201d, which had imposed a ban on open-pit mining before the cut-off date.264\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 244.\n\n196.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant acquired knowledge of the loss before the cut-off date. In particular, the Claimant knew that the loss had been caused by the 2010 TCA Decision.265 According to the Respondent, the Claimant expressly recognized that the 2010 TCA Decision had deprived it of the entire value of its investment in its press release of 18 January 2011, whereby it stated that \u201c[t]he Company [*i.e*., the Claimant] is seeking to re-establish the security and value of its considerable and long-term investments in Costa Rica and to reverse the negative impact that the Ruling has had with respect to the Company\u2019s share price and the inherent negative impact on its investors and employees.\u201d266 The Respondent also points to Infinito\u2019s reports, press releases and financial statements in which it recognized the loss caused by the 2010 TCA Decision; to Mr. Rojas\u2019s confirmation that the Project was halted, and to Infinito\u2019s decision to allow the BNP\u2019s facility to lapse.267 Indeed, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s investment was worthless even before the 2010 TCA Decision, noting that various financial statements issued between 2008 and 2010 showed that Infinito\u2019s finances were already deteriorating.268\n\nR-Rej.

The Respondent infers from this fact that the Claimant was aware of the loss or damage before the cut-off date caused by the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, since the loss is the same.269\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 252.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant\u2019s arguments based on merely subjective beliefs and expectations, for instance that the Administrative Chamber would overturn the 2010 TCA Decision, are irrelevant for the purposes of the objective test required by Article XII(3)(c).270\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 379.\n\n**c. Article IV of the BIT Does Not Permit Infinito to Bypass the Requirements of Article XII(3)(c)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nFinally, the Respondent denies that the MFN clause, contained in Article IV of the BIT, permits the Claimant to bypass the requirements of Article XII(3)(c). More specifically, it argues that Article IV does not permit the Claimant to import the more favorable dispute resolution provisions in the Costa Rica-Taiwan and Costa Rica-Korea BITs, which do not contain a provision such as Article XII(3)(c).271\n\nR-CM Merits, Section III.B; R-Rej. Merits, Section III.C.\n\n200.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the BIT\u2019s MFN clause is a substantive provision and cannot be used to import provisions from other investment treaties entered into by the Respondent.272 To be able to invoke that clause, the Claimant would need to show affirmatively that the MFN obligation has not been met due to some action or omission by the Respondent, which the Claimant has not done.273\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 257-261.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 262-265.\n\n201.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that Article IV(a) of the BIT does not encompass dispute resolution.274\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 267-283.\n\n202.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that Article XII of the BIT contains jurisdictional requirements (rather than admissibility requirements), and such requirements cannot be bypassed by operation of the MFN clause.275\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 286-291.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it filed its claim in accordance with the statute of limitations provisions contained in the BIT. It argues that it first acquired knowledge of the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT and knowledge that its investment in Costa Rica had been rendered substantially worthless on 30 November 2011 (*i.e*. within the limitations period). This was the date on which the Administrative Chamber released its decision annulling the resolutions granting Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession and other key permits, and the date that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban for the first time made it impossible for the Claimant to continue with the Crucitas Project.276\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 446.\n\n**a. The Claimant First Knew that the Respondent Breached the BIT, and that It Had Suffered Damages, on 30 November 2011**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it first knew that the Respondent breached the BIT and that it suffered damages on 30 November 2011. The Claimant asserts that it did not consider the 2010 TCA Decision to be final; instead it expected that it would be able to continue to develop the Crucitas Project following the release of a favorable judgment by the Administrative Chamber.277\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 452.\n\n205.\n\nFirst, according to the Claimant, the record shows that, after the TCA released its Decision, the Claimant was \u201csurprised and frustrated, but it had every expectation that the Administrative Chamber would overturn the [2010 TCA Decision],\u201d allowing the Claimant to \u201cfinish building, and start operating, the Crucitas [P]roject.\u201d278 The Claimant points to the following facts to support this allegation:\n\na. The Claimant and its independent auditor Ernst & Young did not record an impairment charge in the Claimant\u2019s audited financial statements regarding the Claimant\u2019s mineral properties in Costa Rica after the release of the 2010 TCA Decision. The Claimant\u2019s external auditors noted in a presentation that Claimant would only have to consider impairment in the event of an adverse decision from the Administrative Chamber. The Claimant further refers to (i) internal accounting memoranda, explaining its reasoning for not recording an impairment charge; (ii) internal emails, explaining its reasoning for not recording an impairment charge; and (iii) public statements made by the Claimant\u2019s management under Canadian securities laws, confirming their view that an impairment was not warranted.279\n\nb. The Claimant asserts that it anticipated resuming construction after the Administrative Chamber overturned the 2010 TCA Decision, as demonstrated by numerous internal communications. This same expectation is also reflected in the securities filings.280\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 472.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 455-462.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 463-464.\n\n206.\n\nSecond, the Claimant understood that it was the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which had finally and irreversibly annulled the resolutions granting Industrias Infinito\u2019s key permits and rendered the Claimant\u2019s investment in Industrias Infinito substantially worthless,281 as shown by the following evidence:\n\na. Infinito recorded an impairment charge on the assets related to the Crucitas Project following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. As explained in an accounting memorandum, Infinito did not consider that the Crucitas Project was cancelled until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.282\n\nb. The Claimant relies on Mr. Peschke\u2019s witness statement in which he explains that (i) he agreed with the impairment, as well as with the accounting memorandum, and (ii) Infinito began to wind-down the Crucitas Project only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.283 For instance, Industrias Infinito undertook massive employee layoffs at that time.284\n\nc. Internal emails exchanged between 7 December 2011 and 10 January 2012 with regard to the closure of the Project confirm the Claimant\u2019s understanding that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was the judicial measure that caused a breach.285\n\nd. The Claimant\u2019s securities filings show that the Claimant was not considering its investments in the Crucitas Project to be substantially worthless and, by contrast, was expecting to carry on the Project, until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.286\n\nC-Reply Merits, Part Three, II.A.c.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 467; Memorandum from Brian Orgnero (Infinito Gold Ltd.) to Q3 2012 W/P File regarding the 31 December 2011 unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Infinito Gold Ltd.

The Challenged Measures Are All Distinct Legal Measures with Distinct Legal and Practical Effects**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant denies that the challenged measures are deeply rooted in the 2010 TCA Decision, as suggested by the Respondent.287 By contrast, the Claimant contends that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision are distinct from measures pre-dating the cut-off date and had separate legal and practical effects on the Claimant\u2019s investment in Costa Rica.288\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 484.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 484\n\n208.\n\nFirst, the Claimant does not share the Respondent\u2019s view that the breaches crystallized with the 2010 TCA Decision because the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision merely upheld the annulment of the 2008 Concession and thus did not alter the Claimant\u2019s rights.289 Relying on the decisions in *Rumeli, Apotex* and *Eli Lilly,* the Claimant submits that \u201ca lower court decision does not trigger a limitation period if appealed.\u201d290 The Claimant argues that in the present case, the 2010 TCA Decision was suspended during the appeal and was not implemented until the Administrative Chamber had rendered its Decision in 2011, namely when the decision to cancel the 2008 Concession became firm and final.291\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 477.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 480, *Apotex Inc. v.

According to the Claimant, (i) the 2012 MINAET Resolution did not implement the 2010 TCA Decision but the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and (ii) it went further than merely implementing the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. The Claimant argues in this respect that the 2012 MINAET Resolution cancelled the 2008 Concession, the related approvals and all of Industrias Infinito\u2019s remaining procedural rights in the Crucitas area, including its exploration permit and its pre-existing mining rights.293\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 484(c).\n\n211.\n\nFourth, the Claimant contends that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision is independent from the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. Indeed, the Claimant argues that it brought before the Constitutional Chamber an entirely new issue, namely the existence within the Costa Rican judicial systems of various conflicting decisions.294\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 484(d).\n\n212.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that the cases cited by the Respondent, *Spence, Corona* and *ST-AD* provide no guidance for the present case.295 According to the Claimant, the tribunals in these cases found that they lacked jurisdiction either because (i) the breach clearly occurred before the cut-off date; (ii) subsequent facts, such as the sending of a letter or the filing of a motion for reconsideration, are not sufficient to constitute a different breach than a measure that had occurred before the cut-off date; or (iii) the breaches occurred before the entry in force of the applicable BIT.296 The present case is different because Industrias Infinito filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for legitimate reasons and because that proceeding suspended the prior 2010 TCA Decision.297\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 485-487.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 486(a)-(c).\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 486(b)-(c).\n\n**c. In Any Event, Article IV of the BIT Permits Infinito to Bypass the Requirements of Article XII(3)(c)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, should the Tribunal find that the temporal condition in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT is not met, it should then conclude that Article XII(3) is not applicable by operation of Article IV of the BIT (the MFN clause).298 The Claimant\u2019s position is that Article IV of the BIT allows it to benefit from the more favorable dispute resolution provisions in the Costa Rica-Taiwan and Costa Rica-Korea BITs, which do not contain a provision such as Article XII(3)(c).299\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 486.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 488.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the purpose of Article IV is to extend \u201ctreatment\u201d with respect to the \u201cenjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition of an investment\u201d, which includes more favorable provisions of other BITs, including more favorable dispute resolution mechanisms.300\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 488-493.\n\n215.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that temporal limitations cannot be circumvented by the application of an MFN clause on the basis that they constitute jurisdictional rather than admissibility requirements, the Claimant argues that Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT sets out an admissibility requirement to submit a claim to arbitration. The Respondent gave its unconditional consent to arbitrate under Article XII(5) of the BIT. Therefore, the limitation period requirement in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT is part of the procedure which an investor must follow before it can invoke the consent to arbitrate by a State party on the basis of the Treaty.301\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 494.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n216.\n\nPursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration only if \u201c(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\u201d302 In other words, a claim is barred if the Claimant had (actual or constructive) knowledge (i) of the alleged breach and (ii) of the loss it caused, more than three years before the Request for Arbitration was filed.\n\nBIT, Article XII(3)(c), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n217.\n\nAs stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, to decide this objection \u201cthe Tribunal must answer three questions: (i) first, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period; (ii) second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date; and (iii) third, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage before that date.\u201d303\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 330.\n\n218.\n\nThe analysis deals first with the cut-off date (Section(a) *infra),* then with knowledge of breach and loss (Section (b) *in fra*) .\n\n**a. Cut-Off Date**\n-------------------\n\n219.\n\nAs discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Request for Arbitration was filed on 6 February 2014. Hence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims regarding which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach and loss more than three years earlier, *i.e.* before **6 February 2011**. The Parties agree with this cut-off date.304\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 331; *see, e.g.,* C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 233; R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 17.\n\n**b. Knowledge of Breach and Loss**\n-----------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nFor the claims to be time-barred, Article XII(3)(c) requires the Claimant to have first acquired both knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that it has incurred loss or damage, prior to the cut-off date. The Tribunal notes that the BIT refers to knowledge of the alleged *breach,* and not to knowledge of the *facts* that make up the alleged breach. In other words, the limitations period only starts to run once the breach (as a legal notion) has occurred. While a breach will necessarily have been caused by facts, as discussed below, the moment at which a breach \u201coccurs\u201d will depend on when a fact or group of facts is capable of triggering a violation of international law.\n\n221.\n\nAlthough the Treaty does not expressly say so, the loss or damage must flow from the alleged breach. This does not necessarily mean that the loss always postdates the breach. Depending on the standard breached, breach and loss can coincide. This may be the case for expropriation, where the breach will usually crystallize when the direct taking or substantial deprivation occurs. This might also be the case for claims grounded upon a breach of fair and equitable treatment, if the violation of legitimate expectations or arbitrariness is perpetrated by way of an act that causes damage. Hence, the Tribunal finds it more appropriate to address knowledge of breach and loss jointly for each alleged breach.\n\n222.\n\nWhen undertaking its analysis, the Tribunal must also bear in mind that the Treaty (i) uses the conjunction \u201cand\u201d, so knowledge of breach and loss are cumulative requirements; (ii) refers to \u201cfirst\u201d knowledge and not only knowledge; (iii) covers both actual and constructive knowledge.\n\n223.\n\nTo establish when the Claimant first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of an alleged breach, the Tribunal must start by identifying when the alleged breach occurred.\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the breaches of the Treatyoccurred through five measures, which post-date the cut-off date, and which it alleges had the following effects:\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision dated 30 November 2011,305 which confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision and rendered final and irreversible the annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change permit.\n\nb. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban on open-pit mining,306 which entered into force on 10 February 2011, and which prohibited Industrias Infinito from applying for new permits.\n\nc. The 2012 MINAET Resolution dated 9 January 2012,307 which cancelled the 2008 Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito\u2019s mining rights from the mining registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.\n\nd. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision dated 19 June 2013,308 which declined to resolve the conflict between its earlier decision upholding the constitutionality of the Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010 TCA Decision.\n\ne. The reinitiation of the TCA proceedings for environmental damage in January 2019.309\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\nResolution No. 0037, MINAET, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012), Exh. **C-0268**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (19 June 2013), Exh. **C-0283**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Resolution (14 January 2019), Exh. **C-0861**. *See*, C-Reply. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 611-614, 823(b).\n\n225.\n\nThis being so, the Claimant does not allege that each of these measures was a separate treaty breach. As recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction and confirmed in the Reply,310 the Claimant argues that \u201c[i]t is the ***combined operation*** of these four measures [...] that meant that Industrias Infinito definitively could no longer pursue the development of the Crucitas project.\u201d311\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 16 (\u201cThe combined effect of the measures adopted by Costa Rica accordingly breached four protections of the BIT.\u201d) *See also* C-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 448, 466, 473, 551, 590-592, 598, 692.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 12 (emphasis added). It should be noted that, at that time, Infinito had not yet complained about measure (e).\n\n226.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant submits that the combined result of the first four measures breached the BIT in four ways:\n\na. It expropriated its investments by definitively precluding Infinito from building and operating the Crucitas gold mine.312\n\nb. It breached Costa Rica\u2019s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment (\u201c**FET**\u201d) by violating Infinito\u2019s legitimate expectations, treating Infinito arbitrarily and inconsistently, and denying both procedural and substantive justice to Infinito.313\n\nc. It failed to grant Infinito\u2019s investments full protection and security (\u201c**FPS**\u201d).314\n\nd. It breached two substantive obligations imported into the BIT through the BIT\u2019s MFN clause from other investment treaties entered into by Costa Rica: (i) the obligation to do \u201cwhat is necessary\u201d to protect Infinito\u2019s investments, imported from the Costa Rica-France BIT, and (ii) the umbrella clause requiring the host State to \u201ccomply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,\u201d found in Costa Rica\u2019s BITs with Taiwan and Korea.315\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 13; C-Mem.

Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 348-360.\n\n227.\n\nAs to the fifth measure, the Claimant argues that it is a continuation of Costa Rica\u2019s previous FET breach.316 However, as is discussed in Section (vi) *infra,* it appears to have a separate effect.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 613.\n\n228.\n\nThe formulation of the claims suggests that the Claimant relies on a composite breach, *i.e.*, a breach by \u201ca series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful.\u201d317 While it only expressly refers to composite acts in a footnote,318 the argument is that the alleged breaches are the result of the combined effect of the various measures cited above (with the possible exception referred to in Section (vi) *infra).* A composite breach \u201coccurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.\u201d319 Accordingly, were the Tribunal to accept the Claimant\u2019s composite breach argument, it would need to determine the date on which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the action in the series which was sufficient to constitute the breach, and of the resulting loss.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, Vol. II, Part Two (2001) (\u201c**ILC Articles on State Responsibility**\u201d), Article 15(1), Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, p. 170, fn. 835 (\u201cIn cases involving a composite breach, there is no need to establish separate losses that are tied to each individual measure.\u201d)\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 15(1), Exh. **CL-0007**. The Commentary further explains that a composite act \u201coccurs\u201d at \u201cthe time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act, without it necessarily having to be the last in the series.\u201d ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 15, \u00b6 8, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\n229.\n\nHowever, the Respondent denies that the Claimant has properly pleaded a composite breach. It states that \u201c[t]he Claimant\u2019s few passing reference[s] in its Reply to \u2018combined\u2019 or \u2018composite\u2019 effect of those measures cannot be taken as a serious attempt at raising - let alone proving - a creeping violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation under Article II(2)(a).\u201d320 The Respondent also insists on the lack of reference to the fact that a \u201cbreach of an international obligation by a State through a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful require that such actions or omissions be \u2018sufficiently numerous and inter-connected to amount not merely to isolated incidents or exceptions but to a pattern or system.\u2019\u201d321\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 590, citing ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 15, \u00b6 5, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Claimant has not properly substantiated its composite breach argument. The Claimant merely makes some references to combined or composite effect. It makes no submissions on the effect of a composite breach on the time bar requirement. Be this as it may, even if the Claimant had properly pleaded a composite breach, the Tribunal can see no composite breach in the measures impugned. The Commentary to ILC Article 15 makes it clear that, to amount to a composite breach, the various acts must not separately amount to the same breach as the composite act (although they could separately amount to different breaches).322 It also clarifies that the breach cannot \u201coccur\u201d with the first of the acts in the series.323 Here, each of the measures could arguably amount separately to the same breach (an expropriation or a violation of FET), and the Claimant expressly alleges that the breach occurred with what it considers to be the first act in the series, namely, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.324 The Tribunal will thus assess the measures as simple breaches.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 15, \u00b6 9, Exh. **CL-0007** (\u201cWhile composite acts are made up of a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful, this does not exclude the possibility that every single act in the series could be wrongful in accordance with another obligation.\u201d)\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 15, \u00b6 7, Exh. **CL-0007** (\u201cA consequence of the character of a composite act is that the time when the act is accomplished cannot be the time when the first action or omission of the series takes place. It is only subsequently that the first action or omission will appear as having, as it were, inaugurated the series. Only after a series of actions or omissions takes place will the composite act be revealed, not merely as a succession of isolated acts, but as a composite act, i.e. an act defined in aggregate as wrongful.\u201d)\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, chronologically, the first act in the series is the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which entered into force on 10 February 2011; however, the Claimant has repeatedly asserted that this measure only applied to it after the notification of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision on 30 November 2011. *See, e.g.,* C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 334.\n\n231.\n\nA simple breach is a breach by an \u201cact of a State not having a continuing character.\u201d325 As the Commentary to ILC Article 14 explains, it \u201coccurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.\u201d326 The Tribunal must thus determine the point in time in which an act is capable of constituting an international wrong. The cases cited by the Respondent suggest that, where the State has taken a series of separate measures that predate and post-date the cut-off date, tribunals have focused on the event which gave rise to the breach and have refused to look at subsequent events that are not legally significant or distinct.327\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 14(1), Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 14(1), Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\n*See*, R-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 201-214, citing *Spence,* \u00b6\u00b6 146, 163, 246, Exh. **CL-0221**; *Corona,* \u00b6\u00b6 212, 215, Exh. **CL-0130**; *ST-AD,* \u00b6 332, Exh. **RL-0075**; *EuroGas*, \u00b6 455, Exh. **RL-0197**.\n\n232.\n\nThe Commentary to Article 14 provides further useful guidance. It states that \u201cthe existence and duration of a breach of an international obligation depends for the most part on the existence and content of the obligation and on the facts of the particular breach [...].\u201d328 It also notes that \u201c[i]nternationally wrongful acts usually take some time to happen,\u201d the \u201ccritical distinction\u201d being between a breach that is continuing and one which has already been completed. As to \u201cthe moment when the act is performed\u201d (point in time in which a completed act \u201coccurs\u201d), the Commentary notes that the words \u201cat the moment\u201d were \u201cintended to provide a more precise description of the time frame when a completed wrongful act is performed, without requiring that the act necessarily be completed in a single instant.\u201d329\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14\n\n, \u00b6 1, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14\n\n, \u00b6 2, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\n233.\n\nThe Commentary goes on to explain that \u201c[w]hether a wrongful act is completed or has a continuing character will depend both on the primary obligation and the circumstances of the given case.\u201d330 For instance \u201c[w]here an expropriation is carried out by legal process, with the consequence that title to the property concerned is transferred, the expropriation itself will then be a completed act. The position with a *de facto,* \u2018creeping\u2019 or disguised occupation, however, may well be different.\u201d331\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14, \u00b6 4, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14, \u00b6 4, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\n234.\n\nSignificantly for present purposes, the Commentary to Article 14 addresses the question of \u201cwhen a breach of international law occurs, as distinct from being merely apprehended or imminent.\u201d332 It notes that this question \u201ccan only be answered by reference to the particular primary rule,\u201d noting that \u201cwhere the internationally wrongful act is the occurrence of some event - *e.g.* the diversion of an international river - mere preparatory conduct is not necessarily wrongful\u201d:333\n\nPreparatory conduct does not itself amount to a breach if it does not \u2018predetermine the final decision to be taken'. Whether that is so in any given case will depend on the facts and on the content of the primary obligation. There will be questions of judgement and degree, which it is not possible to determine in advance by the use of any particular formula. The various possibilities are intended to be covered by the use of the term \u2018occurs' in paragraphs 1 and 3 of article 14.334\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14, \u00b6 13, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14, \u00b6 13, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, Commentary to Article 14, \u00b6 13, Exh. **CL-0007**.\n\n235.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal concludes that a simple act \u201coccurs\u201d when it has been \u201cperformed\u201d or \u201ccompleted\u201d; that the concept of \u201ccompletion\u201d relates to the point in time at which the act is capable of constituting a breach, which depends on the content of the primary obligation; and that a breach need not be completed in a single act.\n\n236.\n\nHence, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the first step in the analysis is to identify when a given act or omission was performed or *completed****.*** The second step is to assess when the Claimant first knew of the completion of the action or omission and of the loss caused thereby. This analysis must be conducted for each of the standards allegedly breached (Sections (i) to (vi) *infra).* The analysis that follows is adopted by a majority of the Tribunal even when this is not expressly so stated. Arbitrator Stern will set out her views in her Separate Opinion on Jurisdiction and Merits.\n\n***(i) Expropriation***\n-----------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant contends that \u201cthe substantial deprivation of Infinito\u2019s investments did not occur until after and as a result of the combined application of both the [2011] Administrative Chamber\u2019s [D]ecision and the 2011 [L]egislative [M]ining [B]an.\u201d335 The Claimant argues in this respect that it learned about the breach when the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was announced on 30 November 2011, because (i) this is the first time that it knew that the annulment of the Concession was final and irreversible; (ii) it was also the first time that it knew that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban would apply to it; and (iii) it was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision that the MINAET could implement that annulment (which it did through the 2012 MINAET Resolution). The Claimant points out that the 2010 TCA Decision was suspended while the *recurso de casaci\u00f3n* was in process.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 692 (emphasis in original). *See also* C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 472 (\u201cThere is [...] overwhelming fact evidence that Infinito first knew, and only could have known, that the resolutions granting IISA\u2019s key approvals had been finally and irreversibly annulled, and that Infinito\u2019s investment in the Crucitas project had been rendered substantially worthless, on November 30, 2011.\u201d)\n\n238.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent argues that \u201cit was the 2010 TCA Judgment and the legal defects in the 2008 Concession described therein which rendered the 2008 Concession invalid and development of the Crucitas Mining Project impossible.\u201d336 According to the Respondent, the Claimant first knew or should have known of the breach with the 2010 TCA Decision, because (i) this is the measure that declared the annulment of the Concession and other rights; (ii) all of the challenged measures are deeply rooted in the 2010 TCA Decision, and none of them were distinct and legally significant events; and (iii) had the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision not been issued, Industrias Infinito\u2019s Concession would have remained annulled.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 672. As a result, on the merits of the expropriation claim, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to prove a causal link between the challenged measures and the loss of its investment. R-Rej. Merits, Section IV.B.5.\n\n239.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that an expropriation could only have occurred with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. For an expropriation to occur, the taking or substantial deprivation must be *permanent,* or at least not ephemeral in nature. More specifically, a judicial expropriation cannot occur through a decision by a first instance court, the execution of which is stayed pending an appeal, because it lacks finality and enforceability. A judicial expropriation can only occur when a final judgment is rendered or when the time limit to appeal has expired. Here, the procedural framework of the relevant court action shows that the deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s investment only became a permanent loss with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. Indeed, it is only with this judgment that the 2010 TCA Decision became final (*firme*),337 the *casaci\u00f3n* proceedings having suspensive effect over the 2010 TCA Decision. From a legal perspective, the expropriation occurred at the time the suspension was lifted, that is, upon issuance of the cassation decision. To paraphrase the Commentary to the ILC Articles, the legal process initiated by the 2010 TCA Decision was completed with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which is when the expropriation became a completed act.\n\nResolution No. 0037, MINAET, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012), Exh. **C-0268**, Considering 2: \u201cThe Judicial Decision of the Contentious Administrative Tribunal cited above was confirmed by the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, and as a result became final.\u201d\n\n240.\n\nThat is not to say that an investor is required to exhaust local remedies before resorting to arbitration as a requirement for the admissibility of the claim. The question here is a different one: it is whether the 2010 TCA Decision was sufficiently final and enforceable to inflict harm on the Claimant and qualify as a breach as a matter of substance. Court decisions are not final and enforceable if an appellate remedy with suspensive effect is still available. The situation is generally different for administrative decisions, with the result that, \u201can expropriation occurs at the moment of the decision of an administrative authority and is not only completed with the final refusal to remedy the administrative act.\u201d338\n\nUrsula Kriebaum, Local Remedies and the Standards for the Protection of Foreign Investment, in Binder C., Kriebaum, U., Reinisch, A., Wittich, S., International Investment Law for the 21st Century, Essays in Honour of Christoph Schreuer, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 456 (referring to the PCIJ's holding in *Phosphates in Morocco,* Judgment, 1938, P.C.I.J., Series A/B,No. 74,), p. 28, as discussed in James Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, Document A/CN.4/498 and Add. 1-4 (17 March, 1 and 30 April, 19 July 1999), Exh. **RL-0034**, \u00b6 148.\n\n241.\n\nThe record further confirms that, while the 2010 TCA Decision may have initiated the legal process whereby the 2008 Concession was annulled, that annulment did not become definitive and the consequent loss of value to the Claimant\u2019s investment did not become permanent until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision on 30 November 2011. First, the evidence shows that, although the 2010 TCA Decision did cause the cessation of the works on the mine,339 the site was kept in a state that allowed the works to resume following a favorable outcome of the cassation remedy. In particular:\n\na. The quarterly report dated 30 June 2011 stated that \u201cthe Company remains in a position to restart construction activities within three to six months of a favorable SALA I [*i.e.* Administrative Chamber] ruling, recalling its employees and consultants and successfully obtaining project financing. No changes to the Company\u2019s level of preparedness have occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2011, but the Company plans to ramp up activity cautiously in the event of a positive SALA I ruling.\u201d340\n\nb. On 26 November 2010, Industrias Infinito\u2019s VP of Operations sent an email stating that Industrias Infinito \u201cwill continue with an appeal with confidence we will win\u201d and \u201cwe will carry on with the project.\u201d341\n\nc. It was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision that Industrias Infinito laid off 223 of its 243 employees.342\n\nMr. Rojas states that following the 2010 TCA Decision \u201cworks were halted and only camp, infrastructure, reforestation, security and kitchen tasks were performed.\u201d CWS-Rojas 1, \u00b6 198.\n\nManagement Discussion and Analysis for Infinito Gold Ltd. for the First Quarter ended 30 June 2011 (2011), Exh. **C-0253**.\n\nEmail from John Thomas (Industrias Infinito S.A) to Yokebec Soto regarding the appeal of the Contentious Administrative Tribunal's Decision (26 November 2010), Exh. **C-0649**.\n\nCWS-Peschke 1, \u00b6 150; \u201cGold mining company Industrias Infinito lays off 223 Costa Rican employees,\" Tico Times (15 December 2011), Exh. **C-0406**; Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors (Infinito Gold Ltd.) held at the head office of the Company (20 December 2011), Exh. **C-0689**; Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for Infinito Gold Ltd. for the Third Quarter ended 31 December 2011, Exh. **C-0407**.\n\n242.\n\nSecond, the facts on record about the financial effects of the 2010 TCA Decision show that the Claimant did not suffer a substantial deprivation of its investment (a requirement for an indirect expropriation to occur) until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. One indicator is Infinito\u2019s market capitalization: as the Claimant\u2019s financial expert, FTI, explains, while the behavior of Infinito\u2019s share price \u201cis not a reliable indication of the fair market value of the Project for the purposes of determining damages,\u201d it \u201cis illustrative of the market\u2019s perception of the magnitude of the impact of the alleged wrongful acts of the Respondent, and also provides an objective measure on the timing of when Infinito\u2019s investments in the Project became substantially worthless.\u201d343 Here, it is true that the Claimant\u2019s market capitalization dropped about 50% after the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision, from CAD 36 million to CAD 18 million on the day following the announcement of the 2010 TCA Decision (24 November 2010),344 and the Respondent\u2019s damages expert shows a drop to USD 15.4 million by 14 December 2010 (date on which the full decision was issued).345 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a drop of 50% in value does not amount to a substantial deprivation. The fact that Infinito\u2019s market capitalization remained at approximately CAD 15.8 million in the period between the two decisions, reaching a high of CAD 27 million on 11 November 2011,346 also shows that the drop could have been reverted had the outcome of the cassation remedy been favorable to Infinito.\n\nCER-FTI Consulting 2, \u00b6\u00b6 5.32-5.34.\n\nC-CM Jur. \u00b6 146; CER-FTI Consulting 2, \u00b6 5.37.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 241; RER-Credibility 1, \u00b6 150 and Table 10.1, citing Infinito Share Pricing by Capital IQ, Exh. **C-0332**; Infinito Market Cap provided by Capital IQ, Exh. **C-0331**; Infinito Gold Ltd.

Market capitalization fell from CAD 17.4 million on 29 November 2011 to CAD 6.8 million on 1 December 2011 (the day after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision), *i.e.* a further decline of approximately 61%.347 The share price fell from CAD 0.14 on 29 November 2011 to CAD 0.05 on 1 December 201 1.348 From December 2011 to the end of February 2012, the share price remained at a value of approximately 0.05.349 It then continued to decline, reaching CAD 0.01 per share in January 2013, and has remained at or close to zero ever sin ce .350\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 147; CER-FTI Consulting 2, \u00b6 5.39.\n\nInfinito Share Pricing by Capital IQ, p. 11, Exh. **C-0332**.\n\nInfinito Share Pricing by Capital IQ, pp. 11-12, Exh. **C-0332**.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 147; CER-FTI Consulting 2, \u00b6 5.40.\n\n244.\n\nOther elements in the record confirm that the Claimant did not suffer a substantial and permanent deprivation until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision:\n\na. BNP Paribas allowed its engagement letter to expire in November 2010.351 However, following the 2010 TCA Decision, Infinito continued to receive loans from its investor Exploram to finance its ongoing operations.352 The record further suggests that BNP Paribas sought to renew its engagement, but Infinito decided not to sign the letter because of the uncertainty about the timing of the cassation decision.353\n\nb. Infinito\u2019s audited financial statements suggest that the Claimant suffered no loss of asset value until after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.354\n\nc. The Claimant recorded impairment charges of USD 44.6 million in respect of the Crucitas Project following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.355 Conversely, the Claimant did not record an impairment after the TCA rendered its Decision in 2010. Both the Claimant\u2019s external auditor and FTI Consulting confirmed that the 2010 TCA Decision did not warrant recording an impairment charge for Infinito\u2019s assets.356\n\nd. Mr. Peschke emphasized on numerous occasions that the loss stemmed from the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, and that any loss flowing from the TCA Decision was reversible.357\n\nLetter from BNP Paribas to Industrias Infinito S.A., and Infinito Gold Ltd.

In any event, the Claimant could not have acquired knowledge of the loss before 30 November 2011.\n\n246.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant acquired knowledge of the alleged breach and of the loss after the cut-off date. On this basis, it concludes that the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is not time-barred under Article XII(3)(c).\n\n247.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the *raison d\u2019\u00eatre* of a statute of limitations, which is to promote legal certainty by avoiding that claimants delay bringing their claims. This being so, for the statute of limitations to start running, the claimant must be legally in a position to bring a claim. If a claim cannot be brought for legal reasons (for instance, because the claim is not ripe), it would be fundamentally unfair to find that the statute of limitations has started to run. Such a finding may entail that, in some instances, a claimant/investor would have less time to initiate its claim than the statute of limitations. In exceptional situations, that finding might even mean that the claimant/investor has no time left at all to start proceedings, which would effectively result in a denial of justice - an outcome that cannot reflect the meaning of the Treaty. The fact that this situation does not arise in the circumstances of this dispute is no answer to the issue of principle.\n\n***(ii) Fair and Equitable Treatment***\n---------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \u201cCosta Rica has breached the FET standard based on the composite effect of all of the challenged measures, and in particular the actions (and omissions) of the [L]egislature and [E]xecutive before and after the [2011 Administrative Chamber Decision].\u201d358 For the Claimant, the challenged measures violated the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations; failed to treat Infinito\u2019s investment in a consistent, predictable manner; were arbitrary and served no rational purpose; and amount to a denial of justice.359\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 551. *See also,* C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 592 (\u201cInfinito's [FET] claim is based on the composite effect of the four challenged measures: the 2011 Administrative Chamber's decision which annulled the resolutions granting the exploitation concession and other key permits; the 2011 legislative mining ban that prevented IISA from seeking the restoration of its exploitation concession and other permits; the 2012 MINAE resolution that invalidated IISA's remaining rights in the administrative process; and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber decision that failed to address the Contentious TCA's violation of constitutional *cosa juzgada* and *erga omnes* decisions. The combined result of these four measures was that, despite the years of Government encouragement of investment in mining, the rights contained in the Mining Code and the many steps different organs of the Government took to advance the Crucitas project, IISA was left without any rights, or any opportunity to fix the defects identified by the Administrative Chamber and obtain new rights.\")\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 290-344; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 590.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses first whether the Claimant\u2019s FET claim (other than denial of justice) is time-barred (a) and then whether the denial of justice claim is time-barred (b). For purposes of the present jurisdictional inquiry, the Tribunal has assumed that a judicial measure can breach the FET standard beyond a denial of justice, a matter which is disputed360 and is addressed in Section VI.C.1.d(iii) *infra.* The present analysis in no way purports to prejudge this matter, which is properly for the merits.\n\nR-Reply Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 203-208; R-CM Merits, \u00b6 401.\n\n*a. FET (Other than Denial of Justice)*\n---------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its \u201clegitimate expectation was that it would be allowed to proceed through the legal framework established by the Mining Code in order to build and operate the Crucitas project.\u201d361 This expectation was frustrated by the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision,362 and the prohibition set forth in the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution to apply for new permits.363 The Claimant also argues that these measures breached its legitimate expectation to be treated in a consistent and predictable manner.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 500.\n\nC-Mem.

The annulment of its pre-existing mining rights served no rational purpose and was thus an arbitrary measure.366\n\nC-Mem. Merits \u00b6\u00b6 335-336; C-CM Jur., \u00b6 350; C-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 286.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 599.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 336.\n\n252.\n\nThe FET claim thus has two elements, one related to the possibility to operate the Crucitas Project, which was frustrated by the 2008 Concession\u2019s annulment, and another premised on the impossibility to reinitiate the process after the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban.\n\n253.\n\nIn respect of the first element, the alleged FET breach appears to have been completed at the time when Industrias Infinito lost the 2008 Concession, which the Tribunal has determined above occurred with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.367 As a result, the claim that legitimate expectations were deceived by the annulment of the 2008 Concession is not time-barred.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 239-241.\n\n254.\n\nAs to the opportunity to apply for new permits, the FET breach appears to have been completed with the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, both of which prevented Industrias Infinito from fixing the defects in its current rights and obtaining new mining rights.\n\n255.\n\nThe 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was enacted before the cut-off date, but it entered into force thereafter (on 10 February 2011), and the Claimant could not have known that it applied to the Crucitas Project until 30 November 2011. However, Industrias Infinito was already precluded from obtaining new permits as a result of the 2010 Executive Moratoria, which had been in place since May 2010 and which were not abrogated by the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. That said, the Claimant submits that the effects of the Ban, which was permanent, were more preclusive than those of the Moratoria, which were temporary. More specifically, it alleges that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban cancelled all pending proceedings and prohibited the renewal or extension of all exploitation concessions in perpetuity, whereas the prior Moratoria only suspended the proceedings.368\n\nTr. Merits Day 1 (ENG), 45:20-46:4 (Mr. Terry).\n\n256.\n\nThe terms used by the 2010 Executive Moratoria and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban are indeed different. Both the Arias and Chinchilla Moratoria declared a national moratorium for an indefinite time on open-pit mining, which applied to all exploration and exploitation activities that used cyanide and mercury.369 By contrast, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban \u201cprohibited\u201d mining exploitation in areas declared national parks, biological reserves, forest reserves and state refuges of wildlife, and declared certain mining reserve zones.370 It also limited mining in any mining reserves to \u201ccooperatives of workers for the development of mining in a small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use (*coligallero*) from communities surrounding the exploitation sites, based on the amount of affiliates of such cooperatives.\u201d371 It explicitly added a new provision to the Mining Code stating that \u201c[p]ermits or concessions shall not be granted for the exploration and exploitation activities of open-pit mining of metallic minerals on national territory,\u201d and \u201cestablished as an exception that only exploration permits for scientific and investigatory purposes shall be granted.\u201d372 As a result, the Tribunal finds that the effects of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban are not identical to those of the 2010 Executive Moratoria, and are in principle capable of triggering a separate FET breach. Accordingly, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, to the extent that the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations claim is related to the opportunity to apply for new permits, it is not time-barred.\n\nArticle 1 of the Arias Moratorium provided that \u201c[a] national moratorium for an indefinite term is declared for the activity of open pit metallic gold mining in the national territory. This is understood as exploration, exploitation and processing using cyanide or mercury in the work to recover the mineral.\u201d Decree No. 35982-MINAET (29 April 2010), Article 1, Exh. **R-0032** (English). In turn, Article 1 of the Chinchilla Moratorium amended Article 1 of the Arias Moratorium to say \u201c[a] national moratorium is declared for an undefined term for the metallic gold mining activity in the national territory. This is understood as the exploration, exploitation, and benefitting from the materials extracted using cyanide or mercury.\u201d Executive Decree No. 36019-MINAE (8 May 2010), Article 1, Exh. **C-0229** (English).\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 1 (amending Article 8 of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238** (English).\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 1 (amending Article 8 of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238** (English).\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 2 (adding a new Article 8 bis to the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238** (English).\n\n257.\n\nThe 2012 MINAET Resolution which post-dates the cut-off implemented the annulment of the 2008 Concession and declared the Crucitas area free of mining rights. It is a mere administrative implementation of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. As such, it must follow the fate of the claim pertaining to that decision which, as discussed above, is not time-barred.373\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 253.\n\n258.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s FET claim is not time-barred.\n\n*b. Denial of Justice*\n----------------------\n\n259.\n\nAt the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant clarified that its case on denial of justice was \u201cstructural\u201d: it is premised on the Costa Rican judicial system\u2019s failure to provide a mechanism to solve contradictions between the various chambers of the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional *cosa juzgada.374* The claim is \u201cnot about the failure to afford a due process,\u201d nor \u201cabout the decisions themselves being arbitrary.\u201d375 The Claimant\u2019s submission is that the TCA first refused to uphold the constitutional *cosa juzgada* deriving from the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision (the decision which had declared the Crucitas Project constitutional from an environmental perspective), and the Administrative Chamber did the same by denying the cassation request.376 In other words, the Costa Rican judicial system offers no mechanism to ensure consistency, as was confirmed by the Constitutional Chamber itself when it dismissed the Claimant\u2019s action to declare the 2010 TCA Decision unconstitutional on admissibility grounds (through the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision).\n\nTr. Merits Day 4 (ENG), 995:9-996:10, 1163:6-1164:19, 1165:8-21 (Ms. Seers).\n\nTr. Merits Day 4 (ENG), 1164:2-4 (Ms. Seers).\n\nTr. Merits Day 4 (ENG), 1164:4-9 (Ms. Seers).\n\n260.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal considers that this claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. Even if the initial failure to uphold constitutional *cosa juzgada* arises from the 2010 TCA Decision, a denial of justice cannot occur until a decision has been rendered by the highest court. The exhaustion of local remedies rule is a substantive component of the denial of justice breach.377 Because a denial of justice points to a systemic flaw in the State\u2019s administration of justice, there can be no denial of justice until the system had a full opportunity to correct itself.378 Accordingly, the alleged denial of justice could have occurred at the earliest with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, *i.e.* after the cut-off date.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Z. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge University Press, 2009), \u00b6 59, Exh. **CL-0200** (noting that, in cases of denial of justice, \u201cthe local remedies rule is a ***substantive*** requirement for liability rather than a ***procedural*** precondition for the presentation of claims to an international court or tribunal.\") (Emphasis in original).\n\n*See*, *e.g.,* J. Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 108, Exh. **CL-0205** (\u201cIn the particular case of denial of justice, however, claims will not succeed unless the victim has indeed exhausted municipal remedies, or unless there is an explicit waiver of a type yet to be invented. (An *ad hoc compromis* might do.) This is neither a paradox nor an aberration, for it is in the very nature of the delict that a state is judged by the final product - or at least a ***sufficiently*** final product - of its administration of justice. A denial of justice is not consummated by the decision of a court of first instance. Having sought to rely on national justice, the foreigner cannot complain that its operations have been delictual until he has given it scope to operate, including by the agency of its ordinary corrective functions.\") (Emphasis in original).\n\n***(iii) Full Protection and Security***\n----------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s full protection and security claim is premised on Costa Rica\u2019s alleged failure to provide *legal* security to its investments. The Claimant\u2019s latest formulation of its arguments appears to have two main components. First, \u201cCosta Rica failed to create a legal system that protected IISA\u2019s mining rights and provided a process for Infinito to uphold its rights,\u201d in particular because \u201c[t]he Administrative Chamber [Decision] failed to follow constitutional *cosa juzgada*, creating irreconcilable decisions between the Administrative and Constitutional Chambers.\u201d379 This component is thus virtually identical to the Claimant\u2019s denial of justice argument.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 644.\n\n262.\n\nThe second element of the submission is that the Costa Rican executive branch \u201cfailed to rectify the situation\u201d after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.380 Rather than protecting the Claimant\u2019s investment, the MINAET chose to implement the decision, and even went beyond what was legally required. With the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Government not only cancelled Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession but also its pre-existing mining rights. According to the Claimant, \u201cCosta Rica\u2019s executive branch had a duty not only to refrain from acting negligently, as it did, but to take actions to correct unacceptable behavior.\u201d381 It adds that \u201c[b]eyond the executive branch\u2019s own errors in granting IISA\u2019s permits and approvals, it failed to adopt a mechanism to address the inconsistencies in its legal system and thereby correct the untenable legal situation in which Infinito found itself.\u201d382\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 647.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 647.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 647.\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the FPS claim is not time-barred. First, to the extent that it is premised on Costa Rica\u2019s failure to provide a system that prevents judicial inconsistency among the various decisions of the judiciary, the alleged FPS breach could only have occurred on the date of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, or alternatively with the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, both of which post-date the cut-off date. While it is true that the original inconsistency can be traced to the 2010 TCA Decision (which is the one which originally purportedly failed to uphold *cosa juzgada constitucional),* the claim is directed to the functioning of the judicial system, which must be viewed as a whole, including the decision of the highest court.\n\n264.\n\nSecond, insofar as it relates to the 2012 MINAET Resolution, or to the Executive\u2019s failure to redress the situation or otherwise protect Infinito\u2019s investment after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, any such omission would have occurred after the cut-off date.\n\n265.\n\nAccordingly, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the FPS claim is not time-barred.\n\n***(iv) Obligation to Do \u201cWhat is Necessary\u201d to Protect Infinito's Investments***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThrough the MFN clause of the BIT, the Claimant has invoked the more favorable FET standard found at Article 3 of the Costa Rica-France BIT, which includes the obligation to \u201cdo what is necessary so that the exercise of the right so recognized [*i.e.* FET] is not impaired either in law or in fact.\u201d383\n\nAgreement Between the Government of Costa Rica and the Government of the French Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed 8 March 1984(\u201c**Costa Rica-France BIT**\u201d), Article 3, Exh. **CL-0005**; as translated into English in C-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 352.\n\n267.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, to comply with this standard, after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision \u201cCosta Rica should have taken positive steps to protect Infinito\u2019s investments, and in particular to protect the exploitation concession and the other project approvals.\u201d384 Such steps could have included (i) granting Industrias Infinito a new exploitation concession and new Project approvals not tainted by the supposed defect identified by the Administrative Chamber; (ii) repealing the new moratorium on open-pit mining, or ensuring that the new moratorium did not apply to Industrias Infinito; or (iii) ensuring that there was a mechanism in place to address the inconsistencies between the decisions of the different chambers of the Supreme Court.385\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 353.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 353.\n\n268.\n\nIn short, the claim relates to acts that the Respondent should have performed following the cancellation of the 2008 Concession by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which post-dates the cut-off. Hence, according to the majority of the Tribunal, this claim is not time-barred.\n\n***(v) Umbrella Clause***\n-------------------------\n\n269.\n\nAgain through the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause, the Claimant further invokes the umbrella clause requiring the host State to \u201ccomply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,\u201d found in Costa Rica\u2019s BITs with Taiwan and Korea.386\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 356, citing Agreement Between the Republic of Costa Rica and the Republic of China on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed 25 March 1999 (\u201c**Costa Rica-Taiwan BIT**\u201d), Article 3(2), Exh. **CL-0002**; Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Korea and the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 11 August 2000(\u201c**Costa Rica-Korea BIT**\u201d), Article 10(3), Exh. **CL-0001** (\u201cEither Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\u201d)\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that, by annulling the 2008 Concession, Costa Rica failed to comply with its obligations under the Concession, specifically to grant Industrias Infinito the exclusive right to exploit, extract and sell gold, silver, copper and associated minerals from the Crucitas Project.387\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 355, 360.\n\n271.\n\nThis claim is thus linked to the loss of the 2008 Concession. As such, it can be deemed to follow the fate of the expropriation or FET claims insofar as the latter deal with the annulment of the concession. As a result, this claim is not time-barred.\n\n***(vi) Fifth Measure***\n------------------------\n\n272.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant challenged a fifth measure: the reinitiation by the TCA of the proceedings to quantify the costs due by Industrias Infinito and others to remedy the environmental damage and return the Crucitas site to its pre-Project state.388\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 823(b).\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the 2015 TCA Damages Decision ordered Industrias Infinito, the Government and SINAC to bear the costs of restoring the Crucitas site to its pre-Project condition.389 This decision was overturned by the Administrative Chamber and remanded to the TCA in December 2017, where it sat inactive until January 2019, when the TCA reinitiated these proceedings.390 The Claimant argues that \u201c[t]he continuation of this proceeding continues Costa Rica\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable standard, and any damages and costs (including defence costs) associated with this proceeding are further damages to Infinito resulting from that breach.\u201d391\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 612; Contentious Administrative Tribunal Decision No. 1438-2015, File No. 08-001282-1027-CA-6 (24 November 2015), Exh. **C-305**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Resolution (14 January 2019), Exh. **C-0861**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 613. Consequently, Infinito requests \u201ca declaration that Costa Rica is liable to indemnify Infinito for any amounts Infinito or IISA are required to pay as a result of, or in connection with, this late-blooming proceeding.\" *Ibid.*\n\n274.\n\nThe facts invoked differ from the measures challenged under the other heads of claim. The previous four measures are linked to Industrias Infinito\u2019s loss of the 2008 Concession and relate to its inability to pursue it. This measure, however, relates to damages that Industrias Infinito might be required to pay as a result of its use of the site, which damages Infinito deems arbitrary given alleged environmental damage suffered by the site after Industrias Infinito left it. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that this claim pertains to a distinct FET violation, occurring if at all in 2019, that is after the cut-off date. As a consequence, this claim is not time-barred.\n\n275.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over this claim. First, it submits that the claim is premature and falls outside of Costa Rica\u2019s consent to arbitrate. It argues in this respect that the Claimant has failed to fulfil the jurisdictional requirements under Article XII(1) in respect of loss or damage, and has likewise failed to establish a *prima facie* case of breach.392 This is essentially because there is no decision ordering the Claimant to pay damages, as a result of which the Respondent also contends that the claim \u201cis premature, manifestly without legal merit and should be rejected.\u201d393 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection relates to the fact that the claim is premature and is thus properly a defense on the merits, which is addressed in Section VI.C.2.c(ii)c *infra.* Indeed, the question is not whether the Tribunal has the authority to hear the claim; the question is whether the claim is ripe enough to be heard. Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to comply with the amicable settlement, notice and waiver requirements under Article XII of the BIT.394 The Tribunal cannot agree: the provisions on amicable settlement and waiver set out at Article XII of the BIT relate to the dispute as a whole; not to its individual claims. While the fifth measure arises from subsequent facts, it forms part of the overall dispute related to the failure of the Crucitas Project and the economic consequences of this failure on the Claimant. The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant was required to provide notice of this claim, attempt to settle it or waive its rights to litigate it separately from the other claims that form part of this dispute.\n\nR-Rej.

Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n276.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the claims are not time-barred.\n\n277.\n\nIt derives from this conclusion that the Tribunal can dispense with examining whether the MFN clause may disable the statute of limitations under Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. Indeed, the Claimant submitted its MFN arguments in the event that the preconditions of Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT were not met.395 The Tribunal has found in the foregoing sections and in the Decision on Jurisdiction that all of the pre-conditions of Article XII(3) are met, including its time bar provisions, with the result that the Claimant\u2019s MFN arguments have become moot.396 For the same reason the Tribunal can dispense with determining whether the Respondent\u2019s time bar objection goes to jurisdiction or admissibility, as this question arose only if the Respondent prevailed on this objection and in the context of the applicability of the BIT\u2019s MFN clause.397\n\nC-CM.

L****aw Applicable to the Merits**\n---------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nPursuant to Article XII(7) of the BIT, \u201c[a] tribunal established under [Article XII] shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of international law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the extent that the domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or the principles of international law.\u201d398\n\nBIT, Article XII(7), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n279.\n\nAccordingly, the primary source of law for this Tribunal is the BIT itself, which must be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT. Other sources of law may also be applicable, as may be the case with Costa Rican domestic law, provided it is not inconsistent with the BIT or principles of international law. As Article XII(7) of the BIT does not allocate matters to specific sources of law, it is for the Tribunal to determine when an issue is subject to the BIT, other rules of international law or domestic law.\n\n280.\n\nWhen applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The maxim *jura novit curia* - or better, *jura novit arbiter-* allows the Tribunal to apply the law of its own motion, provided always that it seeks the Parties\u2019 views if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.399\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, \u00b6 295 (\u201c[...] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte,* rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\u201d). *See also* Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Federal Republic of Germany v.

O****verview of the Parties\u2019 Positions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Overview of the Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent has breached four of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n282.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argues that Costa Rica failed to grant Infinito and its investments FET in accordance with Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. According to the Claimant, this provision provides for an autonomous standard that goes beyond the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law (\u201c**MST**\u201d). More specifically, the Claimant advances that the Respondent (i) breached the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations that \u201cit would be allowed to follow the procedure set out under the Mining Code [...] to obtain permits for, and ultimately build and operate, the Crucitas project\u2019 and was arbitrary and inconsistent in the treatment of its investment;400 (ii) committed a procedural denial of justice by refusing to provide Infinito with a mechanism to address the inconsistencies between the Costa Rican court decisions on the validity of the Concession; and (iii) committed a substantive denial of justice by retroactively applying to the Crucitas Project the 2002 Moratorium on open-pit mining activities.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 17.\n\n283.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the Respondent did not grant to its investments FPS within the meaning of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT. Indeed, for the Claimant, the Respondent failed to take the necessary steps to ensure the legal security and protection of its investments and thereby prevent the repudiation of its mining rights.\n\n284.\n\nThird, the Claimant submits that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investments. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (which upheld the annulment of the exploitation concession and other project approvals), the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban directly expropriated the Claimant\u2019s Concession and other key approvals, as well as its mining rights. Through the combination of these measures, the Respondent indirectly expropriated all of the Claimant\u2019s investments.\n\n285.\n\nFourth, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent breached its substantive obligations imported through the BIT\u2019s MFN clause (i) to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d to protect Infinito\u2019s investments, and (ii) to comply with its legal obligations.\n\n**2. Overview of the Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it has breached any of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n287.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the FET standard provided in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the MST. The consequences of this limitation are twofold: (i) legitimate expectations are not protected under the BIT, and (ii) the fair and equitable treatment that a State must grant with regard to judicial measures is limited to denial of justice. According to the Respondent, the Claimant had in any event no legitimate expectations, and Costa Rica did not commit a denial of justice.\n\n288.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant mischaracterizes the FPS standard provided in Article II(2)(b), which does not extend to legal security. In the alternative, Costa Rica contends that the Claimant cannot reasonably expect the Government to disregard the judicial decisions rendered by its domestic courts. By contrast, the Respondent argues that its executive branch did what it could to protect Infinito\u2019s investments by defending the legality of the Concession in the proceedings before Costa Rican courts.\n\n289.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that no expropriation could have taken place. Indeed, Industrias Infinito\u2019s mining rights (in particular, the exploitation concession) had been cancelled *ab initio* in accordance with Costa Rican law. As a result, the Claimant held no rights capable of being expropriated. In the alternative, the Respondent is of the view that judicial measures cannot constitute an expropriation unless the investor establishes that it suffered a denial of justice. The Respondent further contends that the alleged expropriatory measures were adopted in accordance with the police powers doctrine to enforce underlying measures aimed at protecting the environment against open-pit mining activities.\n\n290.\n\nFourth, the Respondent argues that the MFN standard does not grant the Claimant the right to import substantive protections from other investment treaties signed by Costa Rica. In the alternative, the Respondent asserts that (i) it complied with the alleged obligation to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d and (ii) that it has neither assumed nor breached any specific obligation.\n\n291.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that Section III(1) of Annex I to the BIT relieves it of liability even if the Tribunal were to find that the challenged measures infringed the BIT.\n\n**C. F****air and Equitable** **T****reatment**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the applicable FET standard under the BIT (1), before reviewing whether the standard has been breached (2).\n\n**1. The FET Standard**\n-----------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize the Parties\u2019 positions (a-b) as well as the Non-Disputing Party Submission filed by Canada (c), before engaging in its analysis (d).\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT requires the Respondent to grant to its investments fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of international law.401 Relying on *El Paso,* it submits that Article II(2)(a) \u201censures basically that the foreign investor is not unjustly treated, with due regard to all surrounding circumstances,\u201d and that \u201cFET is a means to guarantee justice to foreign investors.\u201d402 More specifically, the standard is intended to protect the Claimant\u2019s investment against various categories of harmful treatment, including measures which (i) breach its legitimate expectations; (ii) lack legal basis or transparency; (iii) are adopted without any legitimate purpose and are thus arbitrary; (iv) amount to a denial of justice; and (v) are inconsistent with the good faith principle.403\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 292.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 293, citing *El Paso Energy International Company v.

Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 294-303.\n\n295.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s contentions, the Claimant submits that the FET standard articulated in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is not limited to the MST (i). In any event, it argues that the MST offers the same level of protection as the autonomous FET standard (ii).\n\n***(i) The FET Standard in Article II(2)(a) Is Not Limited to the MST***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nInfinito submits that the FET standard enshrined in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is not limited to the MST under customary international law.404 It first argues that the ordinary meaning of Article II(2)(a) does not limit the FET standard to the MST, as it does not refer to the MST or to customary international law.405 As several investment tribunals have held,406 the reference to \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d does not restrict Article II(2)(a) to the MST under customary law.407 Relying on *Vivendi II,* the Claimant notes that there is \u201cno basis for equating principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment.\u201d408 By contrast, the decisions cited by the Respondent are irrelevant because they do not explain why the expression \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d should be understood to be an implicit reference to MST.409\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 502-503.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 504-506.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 507, citing *Total S.A. v.

Article 1105 of the NAFTA refers explicitly to the MST, and the NAFTA Free Trade Commission\u2019s binding Notes of Interpretation, removed any doubt by confirming that Article 1105 only covers the MST.411 By contrast, the Treaty does not refer to the MST and there are no binding guidelines on its interpretation which would support the Respondent\u2019s reading of Article II(2)(a).412\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 509-511.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 514, citing NAFTA Free Trade Commission Interpretation of NAFTA Chapter 11, 31 July 2011, Exh. **RL-0097**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 514.\n\n298.\n\nThird, so the Claimant says, none of the documents on which Costa Rica relies are part of the context of the Treaty within the meaning Article 31(2) of the VCLT, as they are not the BIT\u2019s text, preamble or annexes, nor do they constitute agreements or instruments related to the BIT.413 Costa Rica did not identify any subsequent agreements between the BIT\u2019s Contracting States or practice in the application of the BIT.414 Canada\u2019s submissions in unrelated disputes which the Respondent invokes do not bind the Contracting States and do not reflect their intention at the time of signing of the BIT.415\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 516.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 517.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 518-519.\n\n299.\n\nFourth, Infinito contends that it is not necessary to use supplementary means of interpretation within the meaning of Article 32 of the VCLT because the Treaty\u2019s language is clear. Relying on the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimant submits that supplementary means of interpretation can only be used when \u201cthe interpretation [...] leaves the meaning \u2018ambiguous or obscure\u2019 or leads to a result which is \u2018manifestly absurd or unreasonable\u2019 or to confirm the interpretation that emerged.\u201d416\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 520, citing Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 288.\n\n300.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant submits that Costa Rica has provided no evidence that could qualify as a supplementary means of interpretation within the meaning of Article 32 of the VCLT. For the Claimant, Article 32 \u201climits \u2018supplementary means of interpretation\u2019 to evidence that provides insight into the negotiations and events leading up to the signing of the BIT [...].\u201d417 However, the Respondent has not pointed to anything in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* that supports its restrictive interpretation of Article II(2)(a). Rather, the evidence submitted by the Respondent (which includes academic writings, statements by Infinito and unilateral statements by Costa Rican officials) does not qualify as supplementary means of interpretation because it is subsequent to the signing of the BIT and does not establish the Contracting States\u2019 intent.418\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 522.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 523-526.\n\n***(ii) The Content of the FET Standard Is the Same Under the Autonomous Standard or the MST***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nInfinito submits that the content of the MST and of the autonomous FET standard is virtually the same.419 Relying on *Rusoro,* it alleges that \u201cthe [MST] has developed and today is indistinguishable from the FET standard and grants investors an equivalent level of protection as the latter.\u201d420 In the same vein, the tribunal in *Waste Management II* held that the MST offers the same level of protection as the autonomous standard.421\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 523, 528-530.\n\nC-Reply Merits. \u00b6 530, citing *Rusoro,* \u00b6 520, Exh. **RL-0181**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 531, citing *Waste Management Inc. v.

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n***(i) The FET Standard Is Limited to the MST***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nFor the Respondent, the legal standard under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is the MST under customary international law. The reference in Article II(2)(a) to the \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d means that the standard is tied to the MST.437\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 366-368.\n\n306.\n\nAccording to Costa Rica, its position is consistent with the rules of interpretation provided in Article 31 of the VCLT. Indeed, reading Article II(2)(a) in light of the ordinary meaning of the terms and of its context shows that it excludes the application of an autonomous standard .438 The Contracting States would not have defined the FET standard by reference to the \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d if they intended to provide for an autonomous standard.439 The Claimant\u2019s contrary view cannot be reconciled with the fundamental treaty interpretation principle of *effet utile* or effectiveness.440\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 368; R-Rej.

For instance, in *UPS, Chemtura* and *ADF*, the tribunals rejected the investors\u2019 attempt to import allegedly broader FET standards provided in other treaties, including the Canada-Costa Rica BIT, through the MFN clause provided in the NAFTA. More specifically, these tribunals held that the FET clauses invoked by the investors offered the same substantive protection as the FET clause in the NAFTA, namely the MST.441 In addition, *Koch, Rusoro* and *OI* concluded that the reference to \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d or \u201cinternational law\u201d in a FET clause meant a limitation to the MST under customary international law.442\n\nR-Rej.

To the contrary, when the BIT was signed, no arbitral decision had been rendered on an autonomous FET standard offering more extensive protection than what is required under the MST.450 In other words, the Contracting States could not have intended to grant an autonomous FET standard while the debate from which this standard arose had not even started.451 Second*,* Canada\u2019s treaty practice confirms that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the standard of treatment under customary international law.452\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 381.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 381.\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 519.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondent denies that its interpretation conflicts with the principle that a State is internationally responsible for the conduct of all of its organs equally. Article 4 of the ILC Articles (on which the Claimant relies for this argument) refers to the principle of attribution, under which the conduct of any organ of the State must be regarded as an act of that State. While the Respondent acknowledges that it is internationally responsible for the conduct of all of its organs, including its courts, attribution is only one component of State responsibility. While a decision from a judicial court is an act of the State for purposes of Article 4, it may not necessarily constitute a breach of international law.473\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 525.\n\n320.\n\nIn sum, Costa Rica maintains that the FET and MST standards are not identical.

Canada contends that the phrase \u201cin accordance with principles of international law\u201d is a reference to the MST. Pursuant to the principle of *effet utile*, this phrase must be given meaning. This interpretation is confirmed by the Notes of Interpretation issued under some of Canada\u2019s treaties, such as the one under the NAFTA.476\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.\n\n323.\n\nAccording to Canada, \u201c[t]here is no difference between the FET standard in NAFTA Article 1105(1) and Article II(2)(a) of the Canada-Costa Rica FIPA.\u201d477 Canada has consistently expressed the position that its post-NAFTA FIPAs, including the Canada-Costa Rica FIPA, are based on the NAFTA. Canada also argues that, \u201cin clarifying and reaffirming the meaning of the provisions, the Notes of Interpretation under Canada\u2019s other treaties do not amend or alter the substantive obligation.\u201d478 As a result, \u201ctribunals have rejected attempts to distinguish NAFTA Article 1105(1) from the FET obligations in Canada\u2019s post-NAFTA FIPAs, including Article II(2)(a) of the Canada-Costa Rica FIPA.\u201d479\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 22, citing *Chemtura,* \u00b6\u00b6 235-236, Exh. **CL-0025**; *UPS* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 182-284, **RL-0227**; *ADF,* \u00b6 194, Exh. **RL-0014.**\n\n324.\n\nCanada further opines that \u201cthe disputing party alleging the existence of a rule of customary international law has the burden of proving it,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his high threshold for proving a breach of FET in accordance with customary international law is what distinguishes the obligation in Article II(2)(a) from the autonomous FET standard.\u201d480 In order to establish the content of the FET standard under customary international law, the investor must provide proof of State practice and *opinio juris, i.e.,* \u201cevidence of consistent and general practice amongst States that is supported by a conviction by States that such practice is legally required by them under international law.\u201d481 For this purpose, the investor must point to the actions of States, not to decisions of arbitral tribunals. Citing *Glamis Gold* and *Cargill,* Canada submits that \u201c[p]ast arbitral decisions are only relevant to the extent that they include an examination of State practice and *opinio juris*;\u201d482 \u201carbitral decisions that apply an autonomous standard provide no guidance inasmuch as the entire method of reasoning does not bear on an inquiry into custom.\u201d483\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 23.\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 24.\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 25, referring to *Glamis Gold,* \u00b6\u00b6 605-607, Exh. **RL-0105**. *See also,* *Cargill, Inc. v.

It does not allow tribunals to second-guess Government policy and decision-making, because \u201cinternational law generally grants a high level of deference to States with respect to their domestic policy choices and balancing of public interest and individual rights.\u201d484\n\nb. It does not protect an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. According to Canada, \u201c[t]he mere failure to fulfil a commitment does not, without more, fall below the customary international law standard of treatment.\u201d485\n\nc. Denial of justice is the only basis upon which judgments of a domestic court may violate the FET standard under customary international law. Canada\u2019s \u201cconsistently held position\u201d is that (i) absent a denial of justice, judicial measures cannot breach the MST, and (ii) \u201cclaims of arbitrariness or unfairness in the context of judicial decisions must be viewed through the lens of denial of justice.\u201d486 For a denial of justice to occur, there must be a very serious failure in the administration of justice. The erroneous application of the law is not sufficient; there must be manifest injustice or gross unfairness. According to Canada, \u201c[t]his rule stems from the recognition of the independence of the judiciary and the great deference afforded to domestic courts acting in their *bona fide* role of adjudication and interpretation of a State\u2019s domestic law.\u201d487\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal will first determine whether the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the MST under customary international law (i). It will then set out the content of the FET standard under Article II(2)(a) (ii). The Tribunal will then address the question whether judicial decisions may breach the FET standard only through a denial of justice (iii). This Section sets out the analysis and conclusions of the majority of the Tribunal, even when it is not expressly so stated. Arbitrator Stern will develop her views in her Separate Opinion on Jurisdiction and Merits.\n\n***(i) Is the Protection Afforded by Article II(2)(a) Limited to the MST?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the BIT provides that \u201c[e]ach Contracting Party shall accord investments of the other Contracting Party: (a) fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of international law; [...].\u201d488\n\nBIT, Article II(2)(a), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimant argues that this provision provides for an autonomous FET standard, while the Respondent considers that it is limited to the MST under international law.\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent has pointed to several awards in which the tribunals have held that the reference to \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d or to \u201cinternational law\u201d is equivalent to \u201ccustomary international law.\u201d489 In turn, the Claimant has referred to other awards that have reached the contrary conclusion.490 While these decisions may provide guidance, the Tribunal must conduct its own interpretation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT in accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation set out in the VCLT.\n\n*Koch,* \u00b6 8.44, Exh. **RL-0200** (\u201cThe FET and FPS standards in this Treaty are prefaced with the express qualification: \u2018in accordance the rules and principles of international law.' In the Tribunal's view, this additional express wording is conclusive in confirming the meaning of the FET and FPS standards as the duties imposed by customary international law and in precluding an independent or autonomous meaning\u201d); *Rusoro,* \u00b6 520, Exh. **RL-0181** (\u201c[As] the BIT qualifies Venezuela's commitment to accord FET (and FPS) treatment \u2018in accordance with the principles of international law', the rule is referring to the CIM [or customary international minimum] Standard\u201d); *OI*, \u00b6 482, Exh. **CAN-0006** (\u201c[I]t is not true that the Treaty with the United Kingdom offers superior treatment to the minimum customary standard, since in reality it only offers protected investors FET \u2018in accordance with international law.' The Treaty therefore does not guarantee FET in abstract, but rather only as recognized by international law. And the level of protection that international law offers and ensures to foreign nationals is precisely what is known as the minimum customary standard.\u201d)\n\n*Vivendi II,* \u00b6\u00b6 7.4.5-7.4.7, Exh. **CL-0029** (\u201cDealing first with Respondent's argument that the fair and equitable treatment is limited to and to be weighed against the so-called minimum standard of treatment under international law, the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for such a limitation and that such an interpretation runs counter to the ordinary meaning of the text of Article 3. Article 3 refers to fair and equitable treatment in conformity with the principles of international law, and not to the minimum standard of treatment. [...] The Tribunal sees no basis for equating principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment. First, the reference to principles of international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard alone. Second, the wording of Article 3 requires that the fair and equitable treatment conform to the principles of international law, but the requirement for conformity can just as readily set a floor as a ceiling on the Treaty's fair and equitable treatment standard. Third, the language of the provision suggests that one should also look to contemporary principles of international law, not only to principles from almost a century ago.\u201d); *Total,* \u00b6 125, Exh. **CL-0088** (\u201c[...] the phrase \u2018fair and equitable in conformity with the principles of international law' cannot be read as \u2018treatment required by the minimum standard of treatment of aliens/investors under international law.'\u201d); *Crystallex*, \u00b6 530, Exh. **CL-0131** (\u201c[T]he Tribunal begins with the examination of the formulation \u2018in accordance with the principles of international law', which is found in Article II(2) of the Treaty [...]. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the FET standard embodied in the Treaty cannot - by virtue of that formulation or otherwise - be equated to the \u2018international minimum standard of treatment' under customary international law, but rather constitutes an autonomous treaty standard. Unlike treaties such as NAFTA, which expressly incorporate the minimum standard of treatment, the Canada-Venezuela BIT nowhere refers to such minimum standard.\u201d); *EDF*, \u00b6 1001, Exh. **CL-0034** (\u201cArticle 3 nowhere mentions \u2018minimum standard' as such, but rather speaks simply of principles of international law. The treaty thus invites consideration of a wider range of principles related to fairness and equity.\u201d)\n\n330.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the text of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is very similar to that of NAFTA Article 1105(1), which provides that \u201c[e]ach Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment ***in accordance with international law,*** including fair and equitable treatment [...].\u201d491 Yet, Article 1105 is expressly entitled \u201cMinimum Standard of Treatment,\u201d a reference that is absent from Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. Moreover, in their Notes of Interpretation issued in 2001. the NAFTA Contracting States clarified that Article 1105(1) prescribes the \u201ccustomary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party\u201d and that \u201c[t]he concepts of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\u201d492 No such note of interpretation has been issued by the Contracting Parties to the BIT.\n\nNAFTA, Article 1105(1) (emphasis added).\n\nNAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter Eleven Provisions, 31 July 2001, Section B(1)-(2), Exh. **RL-0097**.\n\n331.\n\nApplying the general rule of interpretation set out in Article 31 of the VCLT,493 the majority of the Tribunal cannot conclude that the content of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the MST under customary international law.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (27 January 1980) (\u201c**VCLT**\u201d), Article 31, Exh. **CL-0198**. Article 31 provides:  \n\u201cArticle 31. GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION  \n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.  \n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:  \n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;  \n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.  \n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:  \n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;  \n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;  \n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.  \n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\u201d\n\n332.\n\nStarting first with the ordinary meaning of the terms, there is nothing in the text of the BIT that limits the FET standard to *customary* international law. Article II(2)(a) provides that the Contracting Parties are required to accord to investments fair and equitable treatment \u201cin accordance with principles of international law.\u201d The words \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d could be understood as a reference to the general principles of law cited in Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute (\u201c**GPL**\u201d). It is now widely accepted that GPL include both general principles that emanate from domestic laws (*foro domestico)* and are then transposed to international law after an appropriate distillation process, as well as general principles of international law that have emerged directly on the international plane.494 Alternatively, the reference to \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d could designate the various sources of international law set out in Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute.495 By contrast, the expression \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d cannot be regarded as a reference to customary international law, which is but one source of international law and is distinct from general principles. That understanding would imply adding limiting language to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT that the provision does not contain. As noted by the *Vivendi II* tribunal, \u201cthe reference to principles of international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard alone.\u201d496\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation of its understanding for instance in Special Rapporteur V\u00e1zquez-Berm\u00fadez, First Report on General Principles of Law by Special Rapporteur, International Law Commission Seventy-first Session (Geneva, 29 April - 7 June and 8 July - 9 August 2019) (\u201c**First Report on GPL**\u201d), \u00b6 22 (\u201cAmong the categories of general principles of law that may fall under Article 38, paragraph 1 (c), of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, two appear to stand out: (a) general principles of law derived from national legal systems; and (b) general principles of law formed within the international legal system.\u201d); Draft conclusion 3 (\u201cGeneral principles of law comprise those: (a) derived from national legal systems; (b) formed within the international legal system\u201d); and in Patrick Dumberry, A Guide to General Principles of Law in International Investment Arbitration (Oxford University Press 2020) (\u201c**Dumberry, A Guide to GPL**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 1.27; 1.44-1.53.\n\nArticle 38(1) of the ICJ Statute provides:  \n\u201cThe Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:  \na. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;  \nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;  \nc. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;  \nd. subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\"\n\n*Vivendi II,* \u00b6 7.4.7, Exh. **CL-0029**.\n\n333.\n\nMore specifically, GPL (including both principles arising from domestic laws and general principles of international law) are a source of international law distinct from custom.497 For a rule of customary international law to emerge, it requires uniform and consistent State practice and the acceptance of this practice as law *(opinio juris).498* By contrast, GPL are a more flexible concept; they may emerge in a number of ways (including from treaties, case law of international courts and tribunals, and custom499) and require \u201crecognition\u201d from States,500 rather than acceptance as law.501\n\nDumberry, A Guide to GPL, \u00b6\u00b6 1.14-1.15.\n\nSpecial Rapporteur V\u00e1zquez-Berm\u00fadez, First Report on GPL, \u00b6 164; A Guide to GPL, \u00b6\u00b6 1.14-1.15.\n\nDumberry, A Guide to GPL, \u00b6\u00b6 1.49; 1.52.\n\nToday there is wide agreement that there is no need to attribute any particular meaning to the term \u201ccivilized\" in Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute. Special Rapporteur V\u00e1zquez-Berm\u00fadez, First Report on GPL, \u00b6\u00b6 178, 185-187.\n\nSpecial Rapporteur V\u00e1zquez-Berm\u00fadez, First Report on GPL, \u00b6\u00b6 163-175.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, in accordance with their ordinary meaning, the terms used by Article II(2)(a) cannot be interpreted as a reference to customary international law in general or to the MST in particular.\n\n335.\n\nThere is likewise nothing in the context of the provision that would lead to restricting the FET standard to the MST. Neither the text of other provisions of the BIT, nor its preamble or annexes, limit the FET standard to customary international law. To the contrary, when chosing the applicable law, the Contracting Parties to the BIT made a distinction between \u201crules of international law\u201d and \u201cprinciples of international law\u201d, which distinction is unhelpful to decide whether Article II(2)(a) refers to customary international law only or to international law in its entirety.\n\n336.\n\nNor is there \u201cany agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty,\u201d or \u201cany instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty\u201d502 establishing that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT must be interpreted as limiting the FET standard to the MST under customary international law.\n\nVCLT, Article 31(2), Exh. **CL-0198**.\n\n337.\n\nArticle 31(3) of the VCLT further provides that the interpreter must take into account, together with the context, \u201c(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; [and] (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\u201d503 The Respondent argues in this respect that both Costa Rica and Canada have confirmed in this arbitration that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT is limited to the MST, and that this constitutes a \u201csubsequent agreement between the parties\u201d pursuant to Article 31(3) of the VCLT that demonstrates the intent of the Treaty\u2019s Contracting States. According to the Respondent, Article 31(3) of the VCLT does not require any formal agreement in \u201ctreaty form\u201d to be effective.504\n\nVCLT, Article 31(3), Exh. **CL-0198**.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 475-477.\n\n338.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Costa Rica\u2019s and Canada\u2019s concurrent positions in this arbitration do not amount to an agreement within the meaning of Article 31(3) of the VCLT. As Roberts explains, agreements on treaty interpretation \u201cneed not be in binding or treaty form but must demonstrate that the parties intended their understanding to constitute an agreed basis for interpretation.\u201d505 Oppenheim\u2019s International Law also notes that the parties to a treaty \u201cmay in some other way and before, during, or after the conclusion of the treaty, agree upon the interpretation of a term, either informally (and executing the treaty accordingly) or by a more formal procedure, as by an interpretative declaration or protocol or a supplementary treaty.\u201d506 Yet, the Contracting Parties must have *agreed* to a particular interpretation. This requires a joint manifestation of consent from the Contracting Parties, or at least an offer and acceptance, evidencing their common intention that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT reflects the MST under customary international law.\n\nA.

The submissions made by Costa Rica and Canada in this arbitration reflect legal arguments put forward in the context of this dispute to advance their respective interests. Although they happen to coincide, they do not reflect an *agreement* as just described over the interpretation of the BIT. Even if the Tribunal could infer an \u201cagreement\u201d from the Contracting States\u2019 submissions, *quod non,* this agreement would postdate the commencement of this arbitration and the Tribunal could not take it into consideration in favour of one litigant to the detriment of the other without incurring the risk of breaching the latter\u2019s due process rights.\n\n340.\n\nFinally, Article 31(4) of the VCLT requires the interpreter to give a treaty term \u201c[a] special meaning [...] if it is established that the parties so intended.\u201d507 The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not met its burden of proving that the Contracting Parties intended the terms \u201cfair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of international law\u201d to mean \u201cthe minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\u201d\n\nVCLT, Article 31(4), Exh. **CL-0198**.\n\n341.\n\nThe Respondent and Canada also rely on the principle of effectiveness or *effet utile,* which the Respondent argues is \u201cbroadly accepted as a fundamental principle of treaty interpretation.\u201d508 They argue that, if the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT were correct, the terms \u201cin accordance with principles of international law\u201d would be rendered meaningless.509 The Tribunal cannot agree. When determining the protection owed under Article II(2)(a), the Tribunal must be guided by international law (be it GPL or sources of international law in general) as opposed to subjective notions of fairness and equity. The BIT was signed in 1998, before any meaningful debate on the meaning of FET had taken place and before the *Mondev* tribunal famously clarified that a tribunal \u201cmay not simply adopt its own idiosyncratic standard of what is \u2018fair\u2019 or \u2018equitable\u2019, without reference to established sources of law.\u201d510\n\nR-Rej.

Indeed a tribunal faced with such language may not go beyond what the sources of international law dictate the scope and meaning of FET to be. It requires a review of the sources to ascertain whether a specific claim that a State\u2019s conduct breaches fair and equitable treatment is justified. General principles of law derived from national legal systems may prove useful in analysing the scope of the relevant FET obligations (Schill, 2010). The process of discerning such principles can be laborious, but it will advance the understanding of the FET content.\n\nFair and Equitable Treatment, UNCTAD Series on International Investment Agreements II, 2012, pp. 22-23 (p. 41, PDF), Exh. **RL-0266**.\n\n343.\n\nIt is true that the Respondent has pointed to various sources which suggest that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT should be given the same interpretation as NAFTA 1105, and that it was the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention that Article I I(2)(a) of the BIT referred to the MST. The Tribunal cannot give weight to these sources because they do not qualify as means of interpretation under the general rule of Article 31 of the VCLT, nor is there reason to resort to supplementary interpretation means as the application of Article 31 does not result in a meaning that is \u201cambiguous or obscure\u201d or \u201cmanifestly absurd or unreasonable.\u201d Even if the Tribunal were inclined to use supplementary means to \u201cconfirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31,\u201d the sources invoked by Costa Rica would not constitute such means as they do not relate to \u201cthe preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\u201d\n\n344.\n\nThe Respondent first refers to \u201cexpress statements by Canada\u201d which would confirm that the BIT is based on the NAFTA.512 However, these statements are arguments made by Canada in *UPS v. Canada* arguing that foreign investment protection agreements were based on the NAFTA.513 Similarly, the Respondent alleges that, like Canada, Costa Rica \u201chas consistently held that the fair and equitable treatment obligation under its investment protection treaties does not establish an autonomous standard.\u201d514 In support, the Respondent points to its defense in pleadings in arbitration proceedings.515 These sources reflect Canada\u2019s and Costa Rica\u2019s litigation posture, and do not qualify as means of treaty interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT. More specifically, none of these cases was based on the Treaty and thus these statements cannot establish a \u201cpractice in the application of the treaty\u201d within the meaning of Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 370.\n\n*UPS* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 1011, Exh. **RL-0172**.\n\nR-Rej.

Finally, they are not supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT, as they do not serve to establish the intent of the Contracting States.\n\nFor the list of writings by commentators the Respondent refers to *see supra* fn. 444.\n\n346.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal can give no weight to the Claimant\u2019s regulatory filings with the United States authorities, in which Infinito stated that the FIPAs such as the BIT were \u201cbased on the investment protection standards of the NAFTA investment chapter.\u201d517 Statements made by an investor who is not a party to the Treaty do not qualify as means of interpretation under the VCLT.\n\n2007 Annual Report, Form 20-F, Infinito Gold Ltd., before the Unites States Securities and Exchange Commission, for the Fiscal Year ended in 31 March 2007, p. 28, Exh. **R-0045**.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent has also submitted two documents which purportedly evidence its understanding of Article II(2)(a) at the time when the BIT was concluded.

While this suggests a unit within the Legislative Assembly, its exact status is unclear. Indeed, the Respondent characterizes this document as \u201creport submitted to Costa Rica's legislature in July 1998 for the ratification of the BIT [...].\u201d R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 464.\n\n349.\n\nEven accepting that the BIT was drafted on the basis of Canada\u2019s model FIPA, which in turn was based on or inspired by NAFTA Chapter 11, this does not necessarily mean that it offers investors identical protections as the NAFTA. Faced with a treaty provision, the Tribunal must interpret it in accordance with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT, in particular its text and context; it cannot dispense with doing so simply because a provision might have been inspired by another treaty.\n\n350.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal thus concludes that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT provides for an autonomous FET standard and is not limited to the MST under customary international law.\n\n***(ii) Content of the FET Standard***\n--------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nTo ascertain the content of the FET standard, the Tribunal must again start by assessing the ordinary meaning of the words. However, the ordinary meaning of \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d is of limited assistance.523 These notions can \u201conly be defined by terms of almost equal vagueness,\u201d524 such as \u201cjust\u201d, \u201ceven-handed\u201d, \u201cunbiased\u201d, and \u201clegitimate.\u201d525 The tribunal in *S.D. Myers* for instance stated that, unfair and inequitable treatment means \u201ctreat[ment] in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.\u201d526 As noted in *Saluka,* \u201c[t]his is probably as far as one can get by looking at the \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 of the terms of Article 3.1 of the T reaty.\u201d527\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S. C. European Food S.A, S. C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013 (\"***Micula***\"), \u00b6 504, Exh. **CL-0060**.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006 (\u201c***Saluka***\u201d), \u00b6 297, Exh. **CL-0077**.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v.

Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 November 2000 (\u201c***SD Myers***\")*,* \u00b6 263, Exh. **CL-0078**.\n\n*Saluka,* \u00b6 297, Exh. **CL-0077**.\n\n352.\n\nThat being said, while the terms \u201cfair and equitable\u201d are vague, they \u201care susceptible of specification through judicial practice and do in fact have sufficient legal content to allow the case to be decided on the basis of law,\u201d528 and more specifically on the basis of principles of international law as mandated by Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. Indeed, in elucidating the content of the autonomous FET standard, investment tribunals have extracted a number of inherent components, which are implicitly if not expressly derived from GPL and have been reflected in the decisions of international tribunals. For instance, the tribunal in *Rumeli* held that:\n\nThe parties rightly agree that the fair and equitable treatment standard encompasses inter alia the following concrete principles: - the State must act in a transparent manner; - the State is obliged to act in good faith; - the State\u2019s conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or lacking in due process; - the State must respect procedural propriety and due process. The case law also confirms that to comply with the standard, the State must respect the investor\u2019s reasonable and legitimate expectations.529\n\n*Saluka*, \u00b6 284, Exh. **CL-0077**; *see also* *MTD*, \u00b6 113, Exh. **CL-0063**; *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006 (\u201c***Azurix****\u201d),* \u00b6 360, Exh. **CL-0018**; *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award, 6 February 2007 (\u201c***Siemens***\u201d), \u00b6 290, Exh. **CL-0081**.\n\n*Rumeli,* \u00b6 609, Exh. **CL-0075**.\n\n353.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Lemire* identified the following components of the FET standard:\n\n[W]hether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework; - whether the State made specific representations to the investor; - whether due process has been denied to the investor; - whether there is an absence of transparency in the leg al procedure or in the actions of the State; - whether there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad faith conduct by the host State; - whether any of the actions of the State can be labeled as arbitrary, discriminatory or inconsistent.530\n\n*Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010 (\u201c***Lemire***\u201d), \u00b6 284, Exh. **CL-0051**.\n\n354.\n\nIn the same vein, the *Electrabel* tribunal described the content of the FET standard as follows:\n\n[T]he obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment comprises several elements, including an obligation to act transparently and with due process; and to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or from frustrating the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework adversely affecting its investment.531\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012 (\"***Electrabel***\"), \u00b6 7.74, Exh. **RL-0126**.\n\n355.\n\nWhile formulations may vary across awards, a consensus emerges as to the core components of FET, which encompass the protection of legitimate expectations, the protection against conduct that is arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and lacking in good faith, and the principles of due process and transparency. FET also includes a protection against denial of justice.\n\n***(iii) Can Judicial Measures Breach the FET Standard Outside of a Denial of Justice?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThree of the measures challenged by the Claimant - the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision and the TCA Damages Proceeding - are judicial measures. The Respondent and Canada submit that judicial measures can only engage the State\u2019s international responsibility if they amount to a denial of justice. The Claimant challenges this position, arguing that neither the BIT nor the ILC Articles on State Responsibility preclude international State responsibility for acts of judicial organs that do not qualify as a denial of justice.\n\n357.\n\nCosta Rica and Canada essentially argue that, absent a denial of justice, judicial decisions interpreting domestic law cannot breach international law, and that \u201cclaims of arbitrariness or unfairness in the context of judicial decisions must be viewed through the lens of denial of justice.\u201d532 The Tribunal agrees that this is the case under customary international law. The question before the Tribunal is, however, whether judicial measures breach the BIT\u2019s FET standard, which the Tribunal has held not to be limited to the MST under customary international law.\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 31.\n\n358.\n\nTo discharge its mandate, which is to determine whether Costa Rica has breached the BIT, the Tribunal must assess whether the State\u2019s conduct is contrary to the obligations that Costa Rica assumed under the BIT. Judicial measures \u201cemanat[e] from an organ of the State in just the same way as a law promulgated by the legislature or a decision taken by the executive.\u201d533 The BIT does not distinguish between the acts of different Government branches. When Costa Rica committed itself to treating the Claimant\u2019s investments fairly and equitably, it did not exclude the acts of the judiciary from this obligation.534 Nor did it specify that breaches of the FET standard were limited to instances of denial of justice or other forms of manifest arbitrariness or lack of due process.\n\n*Azinian*, \u00b6 98, Exh. **CL-0017**.\n\n*See, e.g.*, *Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Excerpts of Award, 22 June 2010 (\u201c***Liman***\u201d), \u00b6 268, Exh. **CL-0054** (\u201cThe Tribunal does see merit in Claimants\u2019 argument that the two standards are not synonymous with regard to acts of courts because this would introduce a distinction between acts of courts and acts of other State entities for which no support is provided by the ECT\u2019). *See also* H. Gharavi, *Discord Over Judicial Expropriation,* ICSID Review, Vol. 33, No. 2 (2018), p. 353; J. Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 71, 98, Exh. **CL-0205**.\n\n359.\n\nIn the majority of the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no principled reason to limit the State\u2019s responsibility for judicial decisions to instances of denial of justice. Holding otherwise would mean that part of the State\u2019s activity would not trigger liability even though it would be contrary to the standards protected under the investment treaty. While the Tribunal agrees that domestic courts must be given deference in the application of domestic law, this does not mean that their decisions are immune from scrutiny at the international level. As noted by the tribunal in *Sistem*, court decisions may deprive investors of their property rights \u201cjust as surely as if the State had expropriated [them] by decree.\u201d535 In the same vein, judicial decisions that are arbitrary, unfair or contradict an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations may also breach the FET standard even if they do not rise to the level of a denial of justice.536\n\n*Sistem M\u00fchendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u015e. v. Kyrgyz Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009, (\"***Sistem***\u201d), \u00b6 118, Exh. **CL-0082**. *See also,* *Rumeli,* \u00b6 702, Exh. **CL-0075** (finding that \u201ca taking by the judicial arm of the State may also amount to an expropriation\").\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Arif,* \u00b6\u00b6 445, 454, 547, Exh. **CL-0014**; *Frontier Petroleum,* \u00b6\u00b6 284, 525, Exh. **CL-0039.**\n\n360.\n\nCrucially, the question before investment tribunals is not whether the domestic court misapplied its own domestic law. The question is whether, in its application of domestic law, the court has breached *international* law, and more specifically, the standards of protection contained in the relevant treaty.537 In the words of the *Azinian* tribunal, \u201c[w]hat must be shown is that the court decision itself constitutes a violation of the treaty.\u201d538 This can happen if the court misapplies domestic law, but also when it applies domestic law correctly, if it leads to a result that is incompatible with international law. In the latter case, it could be said that it is the underlying law which breaches the treaty. However, if the court is the first State organ to apply that law to the investor, it is the court decision which perpetrates the breach of the treaty.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 217 (holding that \u201cit is the Tribunal's duty to verify if the measures complained of have breached the BIT.\")\n\n*Azinian,* \u00b6 99, Exh. **CL-0017**.\n\n361.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal thus concludes that denial of justice is only one of the ways in which judicial decisions may breach the BIT. Even if a decision does not amount to a denial of justice, it may violate other treaty standards (such as FET or expropriation), provided the requirements for these breaches are met.\n\n362.\n\nIt is true that there are authorities putting forward a contrary view. For these authors539 and tribunals,540 the main reason for restricting the responsibility for judicial acts to denial of justice appears to lie in the nature of the court function and, as the Respondent\u2019s put it, in \u201cthe recognition of the judiciary\u2019s independence and the great deference afforded to domestic courts acting in their bona fide role of adjudication and interpretation of a State\u2019s domestic law.\u201d541 That deference seems linked to the courts\u2019 decision making-process, which resolves complex legal questions and involves a choice among plausible options.542 While these considerations certainly justify restrant when international tribunals consider the local courts\u2019 application of *domestic* law, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, they cannot be an obstacle to adjudicating on breaches of *international* law.543\n\n*See, e.g.,* G. Fitzmaurice, *The Meaning of the Term \u2018Denial of Justice,\u2019* 13 Brit. Y.B Int'l L. (1932) 93, p. 110, Exh. **CAN-0013** (\u201c[t]he rule may be stated that the merely erroneous or unjust decision of a court, even though it may involve what amounts to a miscarriage of justice, is not a denial of justice, and, moreover, does not involve the responsibility of the state.\"); C.

They only have to consider whether they constitute a violation of international law, and in particular whether they amount to a denial of justice\u201d *(**Swisslion,* \u00b6 264, Exh. **RL-0112**), a statement that does not limit liability for judicial acts to cases of denials of justice.\n\nR-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 224; *see also* Z. Douglas, *International Responsibility for Domestic Adjudication: Denial of Justice Reconstructed,* International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 63, No.4 (2014), pp. 6-7, 28, Exh. **RL-0109**.\n\n*See* in particular J. Brierly, *The Law of Nations* (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), p. 287, **CAN-0012**; Z. Douglas, *International Responsibility for Domestic Adjudication: Denial of Justice Reconstructed, International and Comparative Law Quarterly*, Vol. 63, No.4 (2014), pp. 10-11, Exh. **RL-0109**.\n\nThis is so in respect of breaches of rules in investment treaties as well as treaties in other areas of the law, *e.g.* the breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights *(Case Concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo),* ICJ Judgment, 30 November 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 75-82, Exh. **RL-0015**).\n\n363.\n\nThis being so, the conclusion of the Tribunal\u2019s majority is supported by numerous scholars and investment tribunals. Paulsson submits that \u201c[a] national court\u2019s breach of other [non-procedural] rules of international law, or of treaties, is not a denial of justice, but a direct violation of the relevant obligation imputable to the state like any acts or omissions by its agents.\u201d544 Similarly, Gharavi argues that \u201c[t]he acts or measures of the judiciary can [...] be found in violation of the FET standard irrespective of a finding of a denial of justice.\u201d545\n\nPaulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 98, Exh. **CL-0205**. *See also* B. Demirkol, *Judicial Acts and Investment Treaty Arbitration* (Cambridge University Press, 2017), p. 24, for whom \u201c[t]he current approach accepts that wrongful acts other than denial of justice can be committed in the exercise of judicial function.\u201d\n\nH. Gharavi, *Discord Over Judicial Expropriation,* ICSID Review, Vol. 33, No. 2 (2018), p. 355.\n\n364.\n\nThis position is not limited to contemporary authorities. Former ICJ President Eduardo Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga considered that denial of justice was not the only cause of action that could give rise to international responsibility for acts of the judiciary:\n\n[I]n the present century State responsibility for acts of judicial organs came to be recognized. Although independent of the Government, the judiciary is not independent of the State: the judgment given by a judicial authority emanates from an organ of the State in just the same way as a law promulgated by the legislature or a decision taken by the executive.\n\n***The responsibility of the State for acts of judicial authorities may result from three different types of judicial decision****.*\n\n***The first is a decision of a municipal court clearly incompatible with a rule of international law****.*\n\nThe second is what it known traditionally as a \u2018denial of justice.'\n\nThe third occurs when, in certain exceptional and well-defined circumstances, a State is responsible for a judicial decision contrary to municipal law.546\n\nE. J. de Ar\u00e9chaga, *International Law in the Past Third of a Century*, 159-1 Recueil des cours (General Course in Public International Law, The Hague, 1978), quoted in *Azinian,* \u00b6 98, Exh. **CL-0017** (emphasis added).\n\n365.\n\nInternational courts and tribunals have also accepted that a judicial decision may amount to a treaty breach in the absence of a denial of justice. Most tribunals have addressed this from the perspective of expropriation. For instance, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal admitted that \u201cit is well established in international law that the decision of a court in fact depriving an owner of the use of his property may amount to an expropriation of such property [...].\u201d547 Further, in *Karkey,* the tribunal held that \u201can international tribunal may decide not to defer to an arbitrary judicial decision which is, as such, incompatible with international law.\u201d548 It ultimately found that the Supreme Court judgment which had declared the relevant contract to be void *ab initio* was arbitrary and amounted to an expropriation of the investor\u2019s contractual rights.549 In *Saipem,* the tribunal held that the Bangladeshi courts had expropriated the claimant\u2019s right to an ICC award because they had \u201cexercised their supervisory jurisdiction for an end which was different from that for which it was instituted and thus violated the internationally accepted principle of prohibition of abuse of rights.\u201d550\n\n*Oil Field of Texas, Inc. v.

In *Tatneft,* the tribunal assessed the decisions of the Ukrainian domestic courts against the broader FET standard, noting that \u201c[t]he discussion about whether these various decisions amounted to a denial of justice is immaterial because what this Tribunal has to determine in the end is whether they were manifestly unfair and unreasonable.\u201d551 It also noted that \u201c[a] predictable, consistent and stable legal framework is a FET requirement which ought to be safeguarded in its integrity irrespective of which organ of the State might compromise its availability as is well recognized under international law in the context of attribution of wrongful acts.\u201d552 Similarly, the tribunal in *Eli Lilly* was \u201cunwilling to shut the door\" on claims based on judicial measures not amounting to a denial of justice, such as when court decisions are manifestly arbitrary or blatantly unfair.553 The Tribunal in *Frontier Petroleum* likewise assessed a decision of the Czech courts against the broader FET standard.554 Finally, the tribunal in *Arif* accepted the possibility that a judicial decision that frustrated the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations could amount to a breach of FET.555\n\n*OAO Tatneft v. Ukraine,* UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits, 29 July 2014 (\u201c***Tafnet*****\"**)*,* \u00b6\u00b6 394-395, 405, Exh. **RL-0212**.\n\n*Tafnet,* \u00b6 407, Exh. **RL-0212**.\n\n*Eli Lilly,* \u00b6 223, Exh. **CL-0266** (\u201c[I]t is evident that there are distinctions to be made between conduct that may amount to a denial (or gross denial) of justice and other conduct that may also be sufficiently egregious and shocking, such as manifest arbitrariness or blatant unfairness. It is also apparent, in the Tribunal's view, that concepts of manifest arbitrariness and blatant unfairness are capable, as a matter of hypothesis, of attaching to the conduct or decisions of courts. It follows, in the Tribunal's view, that a claimed breach of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment requirement of NAFTA Article 1105(1) may be properly a basis for a claim under NAFTA Article 1105 notwithstanding that it is not cast in denial of justice terms. As noted above, the conduct of the judiciary will in principle be attributable to the State by reference to uncontroversial principles of State responsibility. As a matter of principle, therefore, having regard to the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, the Tribunal is unwilling to shut the door to the possibility that judicial conduct characterized other than as a denial of justice may engage a respondent's obligations under NAFTA Article 1105, within the standard articulated in the award in Glamis.\u201d)\n\n*Frontier Petroleum,* \u00b6 525, Exh. **CL-0039** (\u201c[T]he Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument that this Tribunal does not have the power to review the decision of a national court's conception of the public policy exception under the New York Convention. The Tribunal's role under this claim is to determine whether the refusal of the Czech courts to recognise and enforce the Final Award in full violates Article III(1) of the BIT. In order to answer this question, the Tribunal must ask whether the Czech courts' refusal amounts to an abuse of rights contrary to the international principle of good faith, i.e. was the interpretation given by the Czech courts to the public policy exception in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention made in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner or did it otherwise amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\u201d)\n\n*Arif,* \u00b6 555(g), Exh. **CL-0014**.\n\n367.\n\nThe authorities cited above corroborate the Tribunal\u2019s majority conclusion that Costa Rica may incur international responsibility as a result of the decisions of its courts even in the absence of a denial of justice. The existence of such responsibility will depend on whether the requirements of the various treaty standards, such as FET or expropriation, are met.\n\n**2. Did the Respondent Breach the FET Standard?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a.

In 1997, the President even went so far as to declare that mining was an industry of national convenience.558\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 563.\n\n370.\n\nAccording to Infinito, Costa Rica created a clear legal framework for investments in mining. Under the terms of the Mining Code, the first step in acquiring the right to a mining project is to obtain an exploration permit. If the exploration permit holder successfully proves the existence of a mineral deposit, it is entitled - as of right - to an exploitation concession.559 Once an exploitation concession is granted, it may only be annulled or cancelled on very limited grounds set out in the Mining Code and under a set procedure.560\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 23, Exh. **C-0015** (\u201cAn exploration permit holder shall be specially entitled to the following: [...] (b) Receive one or more exploitation concessions if [it] demonstrate[s] that one or more commercially viable mineral substances deposits exist and are located within the perimeter zone specified in their exploration permit\"), and Article 26 (\u201cDuring the term of an exploration permit and up to sixty days after the expiration of the term or its extension, the holder shall be entitled to obtain an exploitation concession, provided that [it] ha[s] fulfilled [its] obligations and the requirements of this Law and its regulations.\")\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 564.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimant submits further that its expectation that the Crucitas Project would be allowed to proceed arose directly from the Government\u2019s conduct. Costa Rica confirmed this expectation by treating Industrias Infinito consistently with its legislative scheme: after it had proved the existence of gold deposits at Crucitas, Industrias Infinito was granted an exploitation concession by the President of Costa Rica for a period of ten years.561 Costa Rica continued to advance the Crucitas Project, including when the Project encountered obstacles.562\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 308.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 573.\n\n372.\n\nHaving obtained an exploitation concession, the Claimant argues that it expected to be allowed to build and operate the Crucitas mine, and to sell the gold and other minerals from the mine, provided that it received the required environmental approvals. At the time when it invested in Costa Rica, it never envisaged that this right could or would be taken away by a moratorium on open-pit gold mining.563\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 308.\n\n373.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it was not concerned that the Crucitas Project would be affected by President Pacheco\u2019s 2002 Moratorium, because that Moratorium exempted from its application projects with acquired rights.564 It adds that it would not have invested in the Project if its right to an exploitation concession and such concession itself could be revoked at any time. This expectation was reinforced by Costa Rica\u2019s Political Constitution, which declares that \u201c[n]o law shall have retroactive effect in prejudice to any person, or to his acquired patrimonial rights or to any consolidated legal situations.\u201d565 It was equally strengthened by unambiguous representations by the Government. The Claimant stresses in particular that in 2002 Minister of the Environment Rodr\u00edguez assured it that the 2002 Moratorium would not apply to the Crucitas Project, which was also confirmed by the 2002 Constitutional Chamber Decision.566\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 571.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 571-572, citing Political Constitution of the Republic of Costa Rica, Article 34, Exh. **C-0013** (English).\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 572.\n\n374.\n\nInfinito thus continued to invest in the Crucitas Project, on the understanding that the exploitation concession was valid and the 2002 Moratorium did not apply. It could not have expected, so it says, that through a complex series of judicial decisions and Government action and inaction, Costa Rica would end up retroactively applying the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, \u201cnine years after it was decreed and three years after it was repealed.\u201d567\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 572.\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that its expectation was bolstered by the Government\u2019s continued acts in support of the Crucitas Project, even after the Constitutional Chamber annulled the resolution granting Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession in 2004. For the Claimant, these actions in favor of the Crucitas Project included the following:568\n\na. The acknowledgment by President Pacheco and his Minister of the Environment of the legality of the Crucitas Project and the obligation to allow it to proceed following the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision.\n\nb. SETENA\u2019s review of Industrias Infinito\u2019s EIA, spanning 22 months, which included discussions with Industrias Infinito\u2019s representatives, visits to the site, and the largest public hearing in Costa Rica\u2019s history.\n\nc. SETENA\u2019s approval of the EIA for the Project in 2005 and its declaration that the Project was environmentally viable.\n\nd. The Constitutional Chamber\u2019s 2007 clarification that it only required approval of the EIA to precede the grant of an exploitation concession. While that clarification left it to the Minister of the Environment to define both the legal mechanism and the manner in which the exploitation concession could be granted or restored to Industrias Infinito, it did not suggest that the exploitation concession could not be restored.\n\ne. SETENA\u2019s review of the EIA modifications and its declaration that the modified Project was environmentally viable in February 2008.\n\nf. President Arias\u2019 decision to repeal the 2002 Moratorium in March 2008, as part of a decree safeguarding the mining environment in Costa Rica.\n\ng. President Arias\u2019 and Minister Dobles\u2019 decision to restore Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession in April 2008.\n\nh. President Arias\u2019 and Minister Dobles\u2019 executive decree issued in October 2008 declaring the Crucitas Project in the public interest and of national convenience.\n\ni. Minister Dobles\u2019 appearance before the Costa Rican Legislative Assembly explaining the benefits of the Project, and noting that the Project had been approved in accordance with Costa Rican law, including environmental laws. He made no suggestion that the 2002 Moratorium might have applied to render the exploitation concession or the declaration of public interest and national convenience invalid.\n\nj. The grant by SINAC of a land use change permit in October 2008, which was the last permit required before construction of the mine could be completed.\n\nk. The 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which concluded that the Project was environmentally sound, in compliance with Article 50 of the Political Constitution and that the exploitation concession and other Project approvals were constitutional and lawful.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 575.\n\n376.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant submits that \u201cfollowing the 2004 Constitutional Chamber decision, all relevant organs of the Government of Costa Rica - SETENA, SINAC, DGM, MINAE, the Minister of the Environment and Energy, the President of Costa Rica and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, among others - worked to advance the Crucitas project through the administrative process.\u201d569\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 576.\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that it relied on the Government to apply Costa Rican law correctly, and indeed, that it was entitled to rely on the validity of the Government\u2019s own acts through the Costa Rican law principle of legitimate expectations (*confianza leg\u00edtima)* and the Government\u2019s obligation to direct the administrative process *(impulso de oficio).* Infinito could not have known that the 2002 Moratorium \u201csecretly applied\u201d to the Project, when the Government itself considered that it did not apply.570\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 578.\n\n378.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s submission that its expectations were objectively reasonable, which \u201cmust be assessed through contemporaneous understanding ***at the time the investment was made****,* not hindsight reinterpretation.\u201d571 Applying this test, it was reasonable to expect that:\n\na. Infinito would be entitled to proceed in accordance with the administrative process under the Mining Code.\n\nb. The Government would apply Costa Rican law correctly and grant Industrias Infinito valid permits.\n\nc. If there were issues to be resolved, Industrias Infinito would have an opportunity to remedy those deficiencies, especially if they were the result of Government errors.572\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 580 (emphasis in original).\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 581.\n\n379.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that Infinito could have no expectation that the judiciary would not declare the exploitation concession invalid, the Claimant clarifies that its expectation was not that the judiciary would not find fault with a \u201cmanifestly illegal\u201d act; it was that the Government would apply its own law correctly, would treat Infinito in accordance with the Mining Code, and that its approvals would not be rendered invalid years later on the basis of the 2002 Moratorium when multiple arms of the Government had assured Infinito that such Moratorium was not applicable.573\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 582-583.\n\n380.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the Government is liable for granting defective permits, a defect which Infinito only discovered with the 2010 TCA Decision.574 The Claimant stresses that it was the Arias administration which selected the *conversi\u00f3n* mechanism, although Industrias Infinito had requested it to carry out a \u201cconvalidation\u201d proceeding.575\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 585-586.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 240; Tr. Merits Day 1 (ENG), 35:17-21 (Mr. Terry).\n\n381.\n\nFor the Claimant, whether or not the Administrative Chamber properly applied Costa Rican law or properly annulled the resolution granting the exploitation concession is not determinative of Costa Rica\u2019s FET obligation. Relying on *Arif* and *SPP,* the Claimant submits that the Respondent cannot rely on its own internal law to justify an internationally wrongful act, and thus cannot point to the judiciary\u2019s decisions to avoid international responsibility.576\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 587-588; *Arif,* \u00b6 547(c), Exh. **CL-0014**; *SPP*, \u00b6 83, Exh. **CL-0249**.\n\n382.\n\nInfinito claims that, through the following measures, the Respondent frustrated its legitimate expectations and treated it in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner:\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which partially confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, \u201cthereby rendering final and irreversible the annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change permit.\u201d577\n\nb. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which declined to resolve the conflict between its earlier decision upholding the constitutionality of the Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010 TCA Decision.578\n\nc. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which prohibited open-pit mining indefinitely save for those holding exploitation concessions, and thus prevented Industrias Infinito from applying for new permits.579\n\nd. The 2012 MINAET Resolution, which cancelled the 2008 Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito\u2019s mining rights from the mining registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.580\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(a); Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(b); Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (19 June 2013), Exh. **C-0283**.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(d); C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 599; Amendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 56(c); Resolution No. 0037, MINAET, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012), Exh. **C-0268**. Infinito also refers to this as the 2012 DGM Resolution.\n\n383.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the \u201ccombined effect\u2019 of these measures violated the FET standard,581 with the result that Industrias Infinito was \u201cleft without any rights, or any opportunity to fix the defects identified by the Administrative Chamber and obtain new rights.\u201d582\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 590.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 592.\n\n384.\n\nFor the Claimant, it is crucial to emphasize that \u201cthe fate of the Crucitas Project was enabled by the decision of the Administrative Chamber, but the end result was the choice of the Government of Costa Rica.\u201d583 As a consequence, \u201cthe end result was the Government\u2019s policy choice\u201d which \u201cwas not preordained or required, and was inconsistent with the Government\u2019s preceding conduct.\u201d584\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 593.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 593.\n\n385.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimant makes the following submissions with respect to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision:\n\na. Before the 2010 TCA Decision, there was never any suggestion that the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Project. Hence, its application in the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision breached the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations that the Crucitas Project would proceed in conformity with the Mining Code and that the Government would act consistently, transparently and in accordance with its own law correctly.585\n\nb. Costa Rica\u2019s argument that it was evident that the 2002 Moratorium applied since 2004 relies on hindsight and is not credible considering the Government\u2019s conduct between 2004 and 2010.586\n\nc. Had the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Crucitas Project in 2002, it would have violated Costa Rica\u2019s FET obligation, as it would have eviscerated the legal framework upon which Infinito was induced to invest. The Administrative Chamber\u2019s application of the 2002 Moratorium nine years later is no less a breach.587\n\nd. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision applied the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project even though that Moratorium had been repealed by the Government in March 2008. The application of the 2002 Moratorium to the Project served no rational purpose and was thus arbitrary and in breach of the FET standard.588\n\ne. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision also breaches FET for failing to treat Infinito consistently and in a predictable manner. The Administrative Chamber applied the 2002 Moratorium years after Infinito made a substantial investment and contradicted various decisions of the Constitutional Chamber and specific commitments of other arms of the State.589\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 594.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 595.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 596.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 335.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 597.\n\n386.\n\nFollowing the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the Claimant alleges that Costa Rica\u2019s FET breach culminated through the combined effect of such Decision, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, and the Chinchilla Government\u2019s inaction.590 Costa Rica simply \u201cwash[ed] its hands\u201d of the Crucitas Project.591 In this context, Infinito submits that Article IV of the BIT allows the Tribunal to import the standard found in the Costa Rica-France BIT that requires the State to do \u201cwhat is necessary\u201d to protect Infinito\u2019s investments. However, Costa Rica did nothing to address the unfair manner in which Infinito was treated.592\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 598.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 598.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 598, 600, fn. 1082.\n\n387.\n\nWith respect to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the Claimant emphasizes that, contrary to previous moratoria, the Ban was permanent, it cancelled all pending proceedings (rather than suspending them), and prohibited the renewal or extension of all exploitation concessions in perpetuity.593 The Claimant characterizes the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban as an \u201cunprecedented change in the applicable legal framework\" that violated its legitimate expectations.594 It also submits that the choice to change the regime previously enshrined in the Mining Code by prohibiting the grant of any further exploitation concessions was arbitrary, capricious, and lacked transparency.595\n\nTr. Merits Day 1 (ENG), 45:20-46:4 (Mr. Terry).\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 599.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 601.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that there was no rational purpose for applying the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban to the Crucitas Project. There is no evidence, so says the Claimant, that the Crucitas Project threatened the environment or biodiversity. To the contrary, the Project had obtained all environmental permits and was found to be environmentally sound by the Constitutional Chamber.596\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 604.\n\n389.\n\nAs to the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Claimant asserts that it went beyond what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber and cancelled all of Industrias Infinito\u2019s pre-existing mining rights, striking them from the Mining Registry. The Claimant speculates that \u201c[t]his was likely done pursuant to the terms of the 2011 [L]egislative [M]ining [B]an, which unlike prior moratoria, required that all administrative processes under the Mining Code without a valid exploitation concession be archived.\u201d597 The Claimant also contends that this cancellation served no rational purpose and was thus arbitrary.598\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 600.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 336.\n\n390.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that Costa Rica did transform the legal and business environment of the investment.599 When Infinito purchased Industrias Infinito in 2000, it relied on the Government\u2019s support for mining investment and on the Mining Code.600 Starting with the 2002 Moratorium, Costa Rica eviscerated the legal framework under the Mining Code that formed the basis of Infinito\u2019s investment, through changes to laws and judicial decisions. In 2011, the Administrative Chamber annulled the resolutions granting Infinito\u2019s key permits and approvals on novel grounds.601\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 607-610.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 607.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 609.\n\n391.\n\nInfinito, so it says, was then prevented from remedying any of the defects identified by the Administrative Chamber by the operation of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. The Claimant emphasizes that \u201c[i]t is impossible to see these changes as anything other than a complete repudiation of the statutory scheme underlying Infinito\u2019s investment that made it impossible for the Crucitas [P]roject to proceed.\u201d602\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 610.\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that Costa Rica\u2019s unfair and inequitable treatment towards its investments has not stopped with the measures challenged in this arbitration.603 It recalls that, in 2015, the TCA ordered Industrias Infinito, SINAC and the Government to pay to return the Crucitas site to its pre-project state.604 This decision, which was contrary to the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s conclusion that Industrias Infinito\u2019s activities posed no environmental risk, was overturned by the Administrative Chamber and remitted back to the TCA in December 2017.605\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 611-614.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 612.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 612.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant stresses that, two weeks before the filing of the Reply, Costa Rica re-initiated this dormant proceeding.606 For the Claimant, \u201c[t]he continuation of this proceeding continues Costa Rica\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable standard, and any damages and costs (including defence costs) associated with this proceeding are further damages to Infinito resulting from that breach.\u201d607 Indeed, a reasonable court could not hold Industrias Infinito liable to pay to return the site to its pre-project state, given that the site has been harmed by illegal mining and hurricane Otto in 2016.608\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 611.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 613.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 611.\n\n394.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests \u201ca declaration that Costa Rica is liable to indemnify Infinito for any amounts Infinito or [Industrias Infinito] are required to pay as a result of, or in connection with, this late-blooming proceeding.\u201d609\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 613.\n\n***(ii) Costa Rica Denied Infinito Justice***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s further submission that Costa Rica committed a denial of justice by failing to provide a legal system capable of protecting its investments. More specifically, it argues that Infinito was denied procedural and substantive justice.610\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 615-616.\n\n396.\n\nFirst, Infinito complains about a procedural denial of justice, which in its words \u201cis caused by systemic issues with the operation of a justice system \u2018as a whole\u2019,\u201d611 that is \u201cnot by the \u2018aberrant decision by a lower official,\u2019 but rather from the lack of a \u2018reasonably available national mechanism to correct the challenged action,\u2019 when appellate proceedings are \u2018dysfunctional,\u2019 or because \u2018a failure of a judicial system [...] is not capable of being rectified by existing remedies\u2019.\u201d612\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 397.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 397, citing *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

The Costa Rican court system failed, because it resulted in two fundamentally inconsistent decisions from two different Chambers of the same Supreme Court.613 The Administrative Chamber failed to respect the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decisions, which had *res judicata* and *erga omnes* effects, and Costa Rica\u2019s judicial system provided no mechanism to resolve this conflict.614\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 342-343.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 344.\n\n398.\n\nMore particularly, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is inconsistent with previous decisions of the Constitutional Chamber declaring that Industrias Infinito obtained the Concession in compliance with Costa Rican law:\n\na. In 2002, the Constitutional Chamber held that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project.615\n\nb. In 2004, the Constitutional Chamber held that the Crucitas Project could proceed through the EIA approval process.616\n\nc. In 2007, the Constitutional Chamber determined that it only required approval of the EIA in order for the Concession to be granted to Industrias Infinito.617\n\nd. In 2010, the Constitutional Chamber upheld the Concession and the related approvals on the ground that the Project was constitutional and lawful.618\n\nC-Mem.

Merits, \u00b6 342, citing Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Exh. **C-0225**.\n\n399.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the emergence of such conflict between decisions of the Supreme Court was enabled by the creation of the TCA in 2008.619 Prior to the TCA\u2019s creation, persons with diffuse interests could only challenge the constitutionality of administrative acts before the Constitutional Chamber. Thereafter, they could also proceed before administrative courts. The Claimant accepts that it was able to seek a declaration from the Constitutional Chamber that the 2010 TCA Decision was unconstitutional. However, when the Administrative Chamber upheld the 2010 TCA Decision, the Constitutional Chamber rejected that action as inadmissible.620 At that stage, there was no mechanism to resolve the conflict between the Constitutional Chamber and the Administrative Chamber\u2019s confirmation of the 2010 TCA Decision.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 402.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 344.\n\n400.\n\nRelying on *Dan Cake,* the Claimant asserts that \u201c[t]he absence of any reasonably available further recourse against the Court order is such that, in the circumstances of this case, the breakdown must be treated as \u2018systemic\u2019.\u201d621\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 398, citing *Dan Cake S.A. v.

Indeed, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision annulled the Concession despite the fact that (i) the Costa Rican Constitution prohibits the retroactive application of laws, (ii) the 2002 Moratorium expressly provided that it did not apply to any right acquired before its publication, (iii) the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the Concession on a relative (rather than an absolute) basis and \u201cwithout prejudice to the findings of the Environmental Impact Study,\u201d and (iv) the Constitutional Chamber declared in several decisions that the Crucitas Project complied with Costa Rican law.623\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 403; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 628.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 408, 410.\n\n402.\n\nThe Claimant explains that any \u201cinappropriate and egregious\u201d misapplication of Costa Rican law amounts to a denial of justice.624 It also submits that the retroactive application of laws can constitute a denial of justice, particularly when the new law amounts to a repudiation of the pre-existing legal framework. Invoking *Bilcon,* the Claimant argues that \u201cbreaches of the international minimum standard might arise in some special circumstances \u2014 such as changes in a legal or policy framework that have retroactive effect, are not proceeded by reasonable notice, are aimed or applied in a discriminatory basis or are contrary to earlier specific assurances by state authorities that the regulatory framework would not be altered to the detriment of the investor.\u201d625 In the same vein, the tribunal in *ATA* held that the retroactive application of Jordan\u2019s arbitration law by local courts violated the State\u2019s international obligations towards the investor.626\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 408.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 405, citing *Clayton &* *Bilcon,* \u00b6 572, Exh. **CL-0172**.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 407, citing *ATA*, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126, 128, Exh. **CL-0016**.\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there has been no breach of legitimate expectations (i), nor have Costa Rica\u2019s actions otherwise breached FET (ii). It further contends that there has been no denial of justice (iii).\n\n***(i) There Was No Breach of Legitimate Expectations***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even if legitimate expectations were protected by Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, Costa Rica has not breached any of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. The Respondent\u2019s argument is essentially that the Claimant\u2019s expectations were neither legitimate nor reasonable (a);627 and the challenged measures did not breach any of the Claimant\u2019s expectations (b).628\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 527.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 532.\n\n*a. The Claimant\u2019s Expectations Were Neither Legitimate Nor Reasonable*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe Respondent submits that neither the legal framework established by the Mining Code at the time of the Claimant\u2019s investment nor the Government\u2019s support for investment in the mining sector amount to specific assurances or promises to the investor that could constitute the basis for any legitimate expectation.629 To the extent that the Claimant relies on statements by Government officials, these statements (i) were not directly addressed to the Claimant or to Industrias Infinito; (ii) were not specific; and (iii) did not relate to the Crucitas Mining Project.630\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 547.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 535.\n\n406.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s alleged expectation that it would obtain an exploitation concession and be able to operate the Crucitas Project, the Respondent argues that the Claimant is misrepresenting the Mining Code.631 First, an exploration permit holder is not automatically entitled to obtain an exploitation concession, as expressly confirmed by the TCA.632 Second, Article 61 of the Mining Code does not provide an exhaustive list of the grounds to cancel or invalid a concession.633 Third, relying on the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence and on Dr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s expert report, the Respondent stresses that the approval of the EIA is a pre-condition for obtaining an exploitation concession since 1993.634\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 536.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 545, citing *Micula,* \u00b6 666, Exh. **CL-0060**.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 536-537, citing RER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 69, Table 3; RER-Ubico 1, \u00b6 67.\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that Costa Rica\u2019s conduct bolstered the Claimant\u2019s expectation to carry out the Crucitas Project. Infinito \u201ccould and should have been aware that in a rule of law State such as Costa Rica, permits and concession licenses granted by the executive branch must be in accordance with the law and are not shielded or immune from legal challenge from third parties.\u201d638\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 548.\n\n409.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Costa Rica has never stated or suggested that the 2002 Moratorium would not apply to the Project. First, the Claimant\u2019s argument that Minister of the Environment Rodr\u00edguez represented in 2002 that the 2002 Moratorium would not apply to the Crucitas Project is not supported by any evidence. In any event, the Minister could not have made any statement at such time with respect to the 2008 Concession.639 Second, the *amparo* requests filed before the Constitutional Chamber did not involve the Claimant but unrelated companies and the decision did not \u201cverify, analyse or validate the process by which Industrias Infinito obtained the [2002] concession or the legality thereof.\u201d640 The Respondent further denies that the 2010 TCA Decision applied the 2002 Moratorium retroactively to the Concession, since the Claimant had no vested right following the annulment *ab initio* of the 2002 Concession.641\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 549.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 550-551, citing RER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6 113.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 552.\n\n410.\n\nFurther, the Respondent denies that the Claimant\u2019s alleged expectations would have been bolstered by the Government\u2019s continued acts to advance the Crucitas Project even when the Project encountered hurdles. The Respondent argues that \u201cthe Executive never represented to the Claimant - nor is the Claimant alleging that it did -that (i) the mining concession was exempt from the law or from judicial scrutiny, and (ii) that the judiciary would confirm the legality or rubber stamp the measures adopted by the Executive, including the 2008 Concession.\u201d642\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 555.\n\n411.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot rely on the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s judgments from 2007 and 2010 as a basis to its expectation that the 2008 Concession was valid. The Constitutional Chamber declared in its decisions that the Administrative Chamber was the only competent court to rule on the legality of administrative acts such as the 2008 Concession. Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that \u201cthere is no court judgment or other pronouncement from any Costa Rican Court that the Claimant can invoke that would have given rise to a legitimate expectation.\u201d643\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 556.\n\n412.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the Costa Rican legal concepts of *confianza leg\u00edtima* and *impulso de oficio* is not material in the present case. The first principle requires the applicant to have acted in good faith, which is not the case here since the Claimant misled the Costa Rican administration to obtain the 2008 Concession. In turn, the *impulso de oficio* concept is not a guarantee or insurance policy. The Claimant could not expect under this concept that the Executive\u2019s decisions would be free from any legal defect.644\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 560-561.\n\n413.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimant\u2019s expectations were not objectively reasonable, for the following reasons:\n\na. First, the 2008 Concession was clearly not valid.645 As a result, the Claimant \u201ccould not reasonably expect, either at the time that it made its investment or at any other time, that the Concession and related permits would be immune from judicial review and not subject to annulment.\u201d646\n\nb. Second, the Claimant could not reasonably have expected that the 2008 Concession would be exempt from defects and judicial review, since it had already had a similar experience with its 2002 Concession, which the Constitutional Chamber annulled in 2004.647\n\nc. Third, the Claimant could not reasonably have expected the Executive to ignore the rulings of the Costa Rican courts; it could only have expected that the Executive would defend the legality of Industrias Infinito\u2019s rights in the administrative proceedings. The Claimant does not dispute that the Executive did so.648\n\nd. Fourth, the Respondent recalls that, even during the Arias\u2019 administration, there was fierce opposition to open-pit mining and legal challenges to Industrias Infinito\u2019s Concession.649\n\ne. Finally, the Respondent stresses that the Claimant misled the Costa Rican administration and thus cannot invoke the *confianza leg\u00edtima* principle.650\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 563.\n\nR-Rej.

The Respondent\u2019s Measures Did Not Breach Any Legitimate Expectation*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Respondent submits that none of the four measures challenged by the Claimant, analyzed either individually or together, violated the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations.\n\n415.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not frustrate the Claimant\u2019s expectation that the Crucitas Project would be allowed to proceed through the administrative process set out under the Mining Code.651 The Respondent further emphasizes that \u201c[i]f the Costa Rican courts annul a permit or concession because it contradicts Costa Rican law, as they did in this case, this cannot be considered as an inconsistent treatment in breach of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations\u201d and that \u201c[t]his merely reflects the proper operation of an independent judiciary.\u201d652\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 572.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 579.\n\n416.\n\nSecond, the Respondent claims that a measure can only breach an investor's legitimate expectations, if it has transformed the legal and business environment existing at the time of the investment.653 According to the Respondent, none of the challenged measures had the effect of transforming the legal and business environment in which the investment was made:\n\na. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision only confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision,654 and did not reinterpret the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, as the Claimant asserts. The Constitutional Chamber annulled the 2002 Concession because it was unconstitutional, but did not rule on the legality of the Concession, since issues of compliance with administrative law fall outside its jurisdiction.655\n\nb. The 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on the Claimant, since the 2010 Executive Moratoria already prevented Industrias Infinito from acquiring new mining rights.656\n\nc. The 2012 MINAET Resolution simply implemented the orders of the 2010 TCA Decision.657\n\nd. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision simply rejected Industrias Infinito\u2019s constitutionality challenge on procedural grounds.658\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 395; R-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 597.\n\n***(ii) The Challenged Measures are not Arbitrary, Unreasonable, or Otherwise Contrary to FET***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of the challenged measures have otherwise breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n418.\n\nStarting with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the Respondent argues that it did not treat the Claimant in an arbitrary, unreasonable, grossly unfair, unjust, discriminatory or disproportionate manner.659 The TCA applied the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito on the basis of an in-depth, reasonable and fair analysis and objective assessment of all the evidence relating to the legality of the Concession.660 More specifically, the TCA found that Industrias Infinito lost any right related to the Crucitas Project as a result of the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision which annulled the 2002 Concession, and thus that it had no \u201cacquired right\u201d within the meaning of the grandfathering provision provided in the 2002 Moratorium.661 The Respondent further contends that the Claimant \u201ccould and should have expected that the 2002 Moratorium would apply the moment that the 2002 concession was annulled.\u201d662 For the Respondent, the fact that the Claimant sought to overturn the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision and requested a confirmation that the annulment of the 2002 Concession was only relative shows that it was aware of the impact of the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision on its rights.663\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 574.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 574.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 573. *See also, id.*, \u00b6 182.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 575.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 575.\n\n419.\n\nFurther, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not treat the Claimant\u2019s investments in an inconsistent and unpredictable manner, as this judgment is consistent with the earlier decisions of the Constitutional Chamber dealing with the Concession.664 Indeed, the Constitutional Chamber stated that it had no jurisdiction over the legality of a mining project and made no ruling on the issues brought before the administrative courts.665\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 578.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 578.\n\n420.\n\nAs to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (which the Respondent refers to as the \u201cLegislative Moratorium\u201d), it did not specifically target the Crucitas Project, but reflected the Government\u2019s intent to prohibit an activity it deemed harmful for the environment.666 In any event, it did not have any impact on the Claimant because the 2002 Moratorium and the 2010 Executive Moratoria had already prohibited open-pit mining from 2002 to 2010.667\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 582.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 581.\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban prevented Industrias Infinito\u2019s from obtaining a new concession after the 2008 Concession was annulled, because the company had already lost its right to obtain a concession when the Ban entered into force.668 Indeed, Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploration permit and the purported \u201cpre-existing mining rights\u201d relating to it expired in September 1999. The Claimant is thus incorrect when it argues that, because its mining rights reverted to the status prior to the annulment of the 2008 Concession, it could have requested a new concession to exploit the Crucitas mine absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. Industrias Infinito no longer held any valid or pre-existing mining rights when the 2008 Concession was annulled in November 2010.669\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 584, citing C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 601.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 584.\n\n422.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s contentions, the application of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and its implementation through the 2012 MINAET Resolution were premised on a rational purpose. The challenges filed against Industrias Infinito\u2019s concessions as well as the bans on open-pit mining were all motivated by environmental concerns. In any event, the Respondent submits that \u201cCosta Rica is not required to prove in this proceeding that the Claimant\u2019s project would have caused harm; what Costa Rica has to demonstrate is that Costa Rican Courts applied the laws and regulations correctly.\u201d670\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 587.\n\n423.\n\nThe Respondent also advances that the 2012 MINAET Resolution was not contrary to FET. The Claimant could not expect the MINAET to ignore the 2010 TCA Decision and 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision by refusing to cancel the Concession and extinguish the related mining rights. The executive branch made its best efforts within the limits of its powers, namely it actively supported Industrias Infinito through the legal proceedings before the Costa Rican courts.671\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 583, 586.\n\n424.\n\nWith regard to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, the Respondent argues that the Claimant \u201chas not even attempted to explain how [this decision] allegedly breached the fair and equitable treatment standard\u201d and that \u201c[n]either the Claimant nor its Costa Rican legal experts have claimed that the 2013 Constitutional Chamber [Decision] was wrong as a matter of Costa Rican law, let alone that it constitutes denial of justice under international law, or even that it is grossly or manifestly arbitrary or unfair.\u201d672 The Claimant \u201ccannot allege any procedural impropriety, legal unreasonableness or arbitrariness on the part of the Constitutional Chamber\u201d when it issued that decision. In any event, the premise of the claim against this judgment - that the 2010 TCA Decision contradicted earlier findings by the Constitutional Chamber - is flawed, because there was no such contradiction.673\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 588.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 588.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, even taken together, the challenged measures did not breach Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. For Costa Rica, the Claimant has failed to argue or prove a creeping violation of the FET standard through a composite breach.674 In particular, it has failed to show that \u201cthe relevant measures constitute a pattern or system seeking an intended purpose.\u201d675\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 590.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 590.\n\n426.\n\nFinally, with respect to the fifth measure challenged by the Claimant, the Respondent denies that the reopening of the TCA Damages Proceeding amounts to a breach of FET. As there is to date no judicial measure requiring Industrias Infinito to pay any compensation, the Claimant\u2019s claim is premature and manifestly without legal merit.676 The Respondent notes that the Claimant\u2019s new claim arises from a remand notice related to the TCA Damages Proceeding. However, the Claimant has not alleged that it has suffered loss or damage as a result of the remand notice. The Respondent argues that \u201c[t]he Claimant is not arguing that the mere initiation of the TCA Damages Proceeding constitutes an internationally wrongful act;\u201d \u201c[i]t is attempting to bring a claim for potential losses even though such losses may never arise.\u201d677 In the Respondent\u2019s submission, \u201c[t]he Tribunal cannot determine at present whether a future judicial decision by a Costa Rican court will constitute a breach Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.\u201d678\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 598-601.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 599.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 599.\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent further denies that the present case can be compared to *Chevron II,* in which the tribunal granted the investor declaratory relief similar to the one sought here. This is because in *Chevron II,* the relief related to a judicial decision for damages that had already been issued against it.679\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 600, citing *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v.

The threshold for determining a denial of justice is high and goes far beyond the mere misapplication of domestic law.680 Relying on *Azinian* and *Pantechniki,* the Respondent submits that \u201c[a] denial of justice could be pleaded if the relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue delay, or if they administer justice in a seriously inadequate way\u201d681 and that \u201cthe error must be of a kind which no \u2018competent judge could reasonably have made.\u2019\u201d682\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 462.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 462, citing *Azinian,* \u00b6\u00b6 102-103, Exh. **CL-0017**.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 463 citing *Pantechniki S.A.

Merits, \u00b6 603.\n\n430.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet this test. There has been neither a procedural (i) nor a substantive denial of justice (ii).\n\n*a. There Has Been No Procedural Denial of Justice*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n431.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there has been no procedural denial of justice. More specifically, it denies that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is inconsistent with the decisions issued by the Constitutional Chamber in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2010, or that the Costa Rican judicial system failed to resolve that alleged inconsistency.\n\na. First, there is no inconsistency with the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s decisions in April and August of 2010, because the Constitutional Chamber did not rule on the legality of the Crucitas Project; it limited itself to ruling on its constitutionality. Indeed, \u201cthe Constitutional Chamber itself acknowledged in its decisions of April and August 2010 [that] it did not have competence to rule definitively on the legality of the [P]roject, since this was a matter which would fall within the competence of the Administrative branch of the judiciary.\u201d685 As a result, the Claimant\u2019s arguments that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision breached the *res judicata* principle and rendered a decision that was inconsistent with the 2010 Constitutional Chamber decisions is baseless.686 Industrias Infinito had already raised these arguments when it challenged the 2010 TCA Decision, and the Administrative Chamber expressly rejected them in its 2011 Decision.687\n\nb. Second, there is no inconsistency with the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, because the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision assessed the legality of the 2008 Concession, while the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the 2002 Concession.688\n\nc. Third, there is no inconsistency with the 2002 Constitutional Chamber Decision, because the Constitutional Chamber did not pronounce on the legality of the 2002 Concession or on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium.689\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 467; R-Rej.

In the cases at issue, both the Administrative Chamber and the Constitutional Chamber addressed the issue of their competence and concluded that there was no conflict between their rulings in relation to the Crucitas Project because \u201c[e]ach Chamber ruled on the basis of its separate jurisdiction, and explicitly recognized and respected the other Chamber\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d691 Further, the Respondent stresses that the Claimant raised these arguments before the Costa Rican courts, which rejected them.692\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 470.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 470, citing the Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Exh. **C-0225**, and the Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 470.\n\n433.\n\nFinally, the Respondent denies that Costa Rica should be liable because the Claimant\u2019s challenge before the Constitutional Chamber was rendered moot when the Administrative Chamber issued its decision. The Respondent argues that \u201c[b]y initiating its constitutional review petition only 19 days before the 2011 Administrative Chamber [Decision] was rendered, Industrias Infinito itself made it impossible for the Constitutional Chamber from addressing the petition on the merits.\u201d693\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 471.\n\n*b. There Has Been No Substantive Denial of Justice*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that there has been no substantive denial of justice. In particular, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not retroactively apply the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, as the Claimant maintains.694 The Supreme Court merely upheld the 2010 TCA Decision, which found that the 2008 Concession had been granted in breach of the 2002 Moratorium.695 The Administrative Chamber did not apply the 2002 Moratorium retroactively, since it was in effect when the 2008 Concession was granted.696\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 473; R-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 608.\n\n435.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not shown any illegitimate conduct on the part of the Costa Rican courts that would amount to a denial of justice.697 In particular, the Claimant has made no allegations of corruption, improper influence or bias by any of the judges that rendered these decisions.698 Accordingly, \u201cthe Claimant\u2019s claims amount to a mere disagreement by the Claimant with Costa Rican domestic court decisions, and their application of domestic law to the facts.\u201d699 Relying on the Tribunal\u2019s finding that \u201cit is not its role to act as a court of appeal with respect to decisions of domestic courts,\u201d700 the Respondent concludes that the Claimant\u2019s arguments do not meet the high threshold to establish the existence of a denial of justice.701\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 475.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 475.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 474.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 217.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 474.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal will assess whether the Respondent denied Infinito justice (i) or otherwise treated Infinito unfairly and inequitably, including by deceiving legitimate expectations, and by treatment that was arbitrary or inconsistent (ii).\n\n***(i) Did the Respondent Deny Justice to the Claimant?***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a. The Standard for Denial of Justice*\n---------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nWhile the BIT does not expressly refer to the concept of denial of justice, the Parties agree - and rightly so - that it is comprised in the FET standard provided in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.702 The authorities are unanimous in that a denial of justice amounts to a breach of fair and equitable treatment.703\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 301; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 615; R-CM Merits, \u00b6 401; R-Rej.

Dolzer and C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 142.\n\n438.\n\nDifferent authors endorse varying definitions of denial of justice. Some submit that a denial of justice can be procedural (when it relates to lack of access to justice or breaches of due process) or substantive (when it involves a manifestly unfair judgment or the malicious misapplication of the law).704 For Brownlie,705 for instance, the best guide to defining the concept of denial of justice is the Harvard Research Draft, which provides:706\n\nDenial of justice exists when there is a denial, unwarranted delay or obstruction of access to courts, gross deficiency in the administration of judicial or remedial process, failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice, or a manifestly unjust judgment. An error of a national court which does not produce manifest injustice is not a denial of justice.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, R. Jennings and A. Watts, *Oppenheim\u2019s International Law* (9th ed., Oxford University Press, 1992), Vol. I, pp. 543-544 cited in C. Greenwood, *State Responsibility for the Decisions of National Courts,* in M. Fitzmaurice and D. Sarooshi (eds.) *Issues of State Responsibility before International Judicial Institutions,* (Oxford, 2004), p. 61, Exh. **CAN-0011** (\u201cIf the courts or other appropriate tribunals of a State refuse to entertain proceedings for the redress of injury suffered by an alien, or if the proceedings are subject to undue delay, or if there are serious inadequacies in the administration of justice, or if there occurs an obvious or malicious act of misapplication of the law by the courts which is injurious enough to a foreign State or its nationals, there will be a \u2018denial of justice' for which the State is responsible[\u2026]\u201d)\n\nI.

Suppl. 1929), p. 173.\n\n439.\n\nFor others, like Paulsson, \u201c[d]enial of justice is always procedural,\u201d because its objective is to ensure that foreigners are afforded \u201cprocedural fairness\u201d as measured by an international standard.707 Accordingly, a host State commits a denial of justice if it \u201cadministers justice to aliens in a fundamentally unfair manner.\u201d708 Complaints against the substance of a decision may amount to other breaches of the treaty, but are not denials of justice.709\n\nJ.

Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 98, Exh. **CL-0205**.\n\n440.\n\nFor Douglas, the better view lies somewhere in between: while he agrees that denials of justice are essentially procedural, he argues that a theory of procedural fairness must be linked to substantive rights and outcomes, as the purpose of the judicial system is to decide cases and generate good outcomes.710\n\nZ. Douglas, *International Responsibility for Domestic Adjudication: Denial of Justice Reconstructed, International and Comparative Law Quarterly,* Vol. 63, No.4 (2014), pp. 4, 18, Exh. **RL-0109**.\n\n441.\n\nA review of investment arbitration decisions shows similar fluctuations. Some tribunals have considered that a denial of justice involves a failure of procedure and have accepted that a manifestly unfair outcome may be indicative of a procedural failure. For instance, the *Loewen* tribunal defined denial of justice as a \u201c[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.\u201d711 Citing Fitzmaurice and de Visscher, *Pantechniki* articulated this point further:\n\nThe general rule is that \u2018mere error in the interpretation of the national law does not per se involve responsibility.\u2019 Wrongful application of the law may nonetheless provide \u2018elements of proof of a denial of justice.\u2019 But that requires an extreme test: the error must be of a kind which no \u2018competent judge could reasonably have made.\u2019 Such a finding would mean that the state had not provided even a minimally adequate justice system.712\n\n*Loewen,* \u00b6 132, Exh. **CL-0055**.\n\n*Pantechniki,* \u00b6 94, Exh. **RL-0027**, citing G. Fitzmaurice, *The Meaning of the Term \u2018Denial of Justice,\u2019* BYIL (1932) 93, p. 111, fn. 1, and p. 114; and C. de Visscher, *Le d\u00e9ni de justice en droit international* 34 *Recueil des cours* (1935) 370, p. 376.\n\n442.\n\nThe *Liman* tribunal endorsed a similar view:\n\n[T]he Tribunal concludes that Respondent can only be held liable for denial of justice if Claimants are able to prove that the court system fundamentally failed. Such failure is mainly to be held established in cases of major procedural errors such as lack of due process. The substantive outcome of a case can be relevant as an indication of lack of due process and thus can be considered as an element to prove denial of justice.713\n\n*See also* Liman*,* \u00b6 279, Exh. **CL-0054**.\n\n443.\n\nOther tribunals have favored a broader view in which a denial of justice may also be caused by the substance of the judgment, along the lines of the Harvard Research Draft quoted above. For instance, the tribunal in *Azinian* held that \u201c[a] denial of justice could be pleaded if the relevant courts refuse to entertain a suit, if they subject it to undue delay, or if they administer justice in a seriously inadequate way\u201d and noted that, in addition, \u201c[t]here is a fourth type of denial of justice, namely the clear and malicious misapplication of the law.\u201d714 More recently, the tribunal in *Iberdrola* summed up the concept of denial of justice as follows:\n\n[U]nder international law a denial of justice could constitute: (i) the unjustified refusal of a tribunal to hear a matter within its competence or any other State action having the effect of preventing access to justice; (ii) undue delay in the administration of justice; and (iii) the decisions or actions of State bodies that are evidently arbitrary, unfair, idiosyncratic or delayed.715\n\n*Azinian,* \u00b6\u00b6 102, 103, Exh. **CL-0017**.\n\n*Iberdrola,* \u00b6 432, Exh. **RL-0024**.\n\n444.\n\nIn these latter cases, the tribunals have insisted that the substantive unfairness of the decision must be egregious. For the *Azinian* tribunal, the evidence for the domestic court\u2019s finding must be \u201cso insubstantial, or so bereft of a basis in law\u201d as to conclude that \u201cthe judgments were in effect arbitrary or malicious.\u201d716 The *Iberdrola* tribunal added that \u201cdenial of justice is not a mere error in interpretation of local law, but an error that no merely competent judge could have committed and that shows that a minimally adequate system of justice has not been provided.\u201d717 For the *Mondev* tribunal, the applicable test was:\n\n[W]hether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable.718\n\n*Azinian,* \u00b6 105, Exh. **CL-0017**.\n\n*Iberdrola*, \u00b6 432, Exh. **RL-0024**.\n\n*Mondev*, \u00b6 127, Exh. **CL-0062**.\n\n445.\n\nFrom the authorities cited above, the Tribunal concludes that a denial of justice occurs when there is a fundamental failure in the host\u2019s State\u2019s administration of justice. The following elements can lead to this conclusion (i) the State has denied the investor access to domestic courts; (ii) the courts have engaged in unwarranted delay; (iii) the courts have failed to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice (such as the independence and impartiality of judges, due process and the right to be heard); or (iv) the decision is manifestly arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic. The Tribunal thus concludes that a denial of justice may be procedural or substantive, and that in both situations the denial of justice is the product of a systemic failure of the host State\u2019s judiciary taken as a whole.719 The latter point explains that a claim for denial of justice presupposes the exhaustion of local remedies, a requirement that is met here as the complaint targets decisions of the highest courts.\n\n*Oostergetel,* \u00b6 225, Exh. **RL-0017**; *Jan de Nul* Award, \u00b6 209, Exh. **RL-0091**; *Corona,* \u00b6 254, Exh. **CL-0130**.\n\n*b. Did the Respondent Commit a Procedural Denial of Justice?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nAs explained in Section V. D.3.b(ii)b *supra,* the Claimant submits that its denial of justice claim is \u201cstructural\u201d: it is premised on the Costa Rican judicial system\u2019s failure to provide a mechanism to solve contradictions between the various chambers of the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional *cosa juzgada.720* More precisely, the Claimant asserts that it has experienced a procedural denial of justice because (i) the Administrative Chamber failed to comply with the *res judicata* and *erga omnes* effects of prior decisions of the Constitutional Chamber, and (ii) the Costa Rican judicial system lacked a mechanism to resolve these inconsistent decisions.721 This was confirmed when the Constitutional Chamber dismissed the Claimant\u2019s action to declare the 2010 TCA Decision unconstitutional on admissibility grounds (through the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision).\n\nTr. Merits Day 4 (ENG), 995:9-996:10; 1163:6-1164:19, 1165:8-21 (Ms. Seers).\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 392.\n\n447.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s position on the ground that its premise is false. More specifically, Costa Rica contends that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is consistent with the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s decisions because the latter has never assessed the Concession\u2019s *legality,* it has only assessed whether it complied with the relevant constitutional standards. The Respondent notes that Industrias Infinito raised the same arguments on *res judicata* before the TCA and the Administrative Chamber, both of which heard and dismissed them. As to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, the Respondent explains that \u201cthe extraordinary constitutional review petition [...] must relate to another ongoing proceeding because the Constitutional Chamber cannot enjoin a proceeding that has already been completed.\u201d722 According to the Respondent, \u201c[b]y initiating its constitutional review petition only 19 days before the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment was rendered, Industrias Infinito itself made it impossible for the Constitutional Chamber [to] address[] the petition on the merits.\u201d723\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 471.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 471.\n\n*(i) Is the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision Inconsistent with Previous Decisions of the Constitutional Chamber?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is inconsistent with previous decisions by the Constitutional Chamber where the latter allegedly declared that the Crucitas Project complied with Costa Rican law.724\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 341-343.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that this is the factual premise for the Claimant\u2019s procedural denial of justice claim. The Tribunal understands that the Claimant is not arguing that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision amounts to a procedural denial of justice because the decisions of the Administrative Chamber and the Constitutional Chamber were allegedly inconsistent; its argument is that there is no mechanism to resolve the inconsistency between decisions of these two Chambers of the Supreme Court, or more specifically, to ensure that the non-constitutional courts will recognize the *res judicata* and *erga omnes* effects of previous decisions of the Constitutional Chamber.725 As the Claimant puts it, \u201cInfinito has suffered a denial of justice because of an institutional failure rooted in the design of Costa Rica\u2019s court system - the creation of separate arms of the judiciary with overlapping jurisdiction, each with diffuse rights of standing, without a mechanism for resolving the conflicting decisions of the Constitutional Chamber and the Administrative Chamber.\u201d726\n\nTr. Merits Day 4 (ENG), 1163:8-1165-21 (Ms. Seers):  \n\u201cMS. SEERS: \"[...] We've said from the very beginning [...] the denial of  \njustice claim is structural. [...] By \u2018structural,\u2019 I mean [...] the failure of the Costa Rican judicial order [...] to provide a mechanism to resolve the failure by the non-Constitutional Courts to respect constitutional cosa juzgada. [...] It's not about the failure to afford a due process. It's not about the decisions themselves being arbitrary. We're not saying that at all. What we are saying is that the Administrative Chamber refused to follow constitutional - TCA first and then the Administrative Chamber by refusing the cassation requests, refused to follow constitutional cosa juzgada. [...]  \nPRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: So, what you're telling us is that the denial of justice claim is structural, which there is a lack of mechanism to resolve conflicting situations with conflicting decisions? But then is that what it is?  \nMS. SEERS: It is with one precision, if I may. Not any conflicting decision. Failure by the non-Constitutional Courts - in this case the Administrative Court - to follow constitutional cosa juzgada.  \nPRESIDENT KAUFMANN-KOHLER: And so the \u2018cosa juzgada\u2019 argument is part of your structural denial of justice claim.  \nMS.

It contends that the Administrative Chamber failed to reverse certain findings made by the TCA which directly contradicted previous rulings of the Constitutional Chamber in the following decisions:\n\na. The Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decision of 20 August 2002,727 which the Claimant alleges held that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project.728\n\nb. The Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decision of 24 November 2004, which annulled the 2002 Concession \u201cwithout prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment may determine.\u201d729 In the Claimant\u2019s view, this decision held that the Crucitas Project could proceed through the EIA approval process.730\n\nc. The Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decision of 7 June 2007,731 which according to the Claimant determined that it only required approval of the EIA for the Concession to be granted.732\n\nd. The Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decision of 16 April 2010,733 which upheld the Concession and the approvals relating thereto on the ground that the Project was constitutional and (according to the Claimant) lawful.734\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (20 August 2002), Exh. **C-0085**.\n\nC-Mem.

The Tribunal has also assessed the procedural conduct and reasoning of these courts, and concludes that they were based on the relevant provisions of Costa Rican law and are not objectionable from the point of view of international law.\n\n452.\n\nIndustrias Infinito raised the *res judicata* objection both with the TCA and the Administrative Chamber. Both courts denied that objection on the ground that the Constitutional Chamber had expressly declined its jurisdiction to entertain issues of legality. To reach this conclusion, the TCA, in a thirteen-page-long reasoning, started by noting that administrative and constitutional courts have different areas of competence under Costa Rican law. It explained that the *amparo* proceedings governed by Article 48 of the Costa Rican Constitution735 and Article 29 of the Constitutional Jurisdiction Law736 were only intended to ensure the protection of fundamental and constitutional rights.737 By contrast, pursuant to Article 49 of the Costa Rican Constitution, the competence to review the legality of administrative acts lies exclusively with the contentious-administrative courts.738 Furthermore, the TCA pointed to Article 55 of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction, pursuant to which \u201cthe rejection of the action for constitutional rights protection *(amparo)* does not prejudge the liabilities that the offender may have incurred into [...].\u201d739 On this basis, the TCA concluded that, while the dismissal of an *amparo* action might mean that there is no violation of constitutional rights, it does not imply that the defendant cannot be held liable on other grounds.740\n\nPolitical Constitution of the Republic of Costa Rica, Article 48, Exh. **C-0013** (\u201cEveryone has the right to habeas corpus to guarantee personal freedom and integrity, and to writs of amparo to maintain or restore the enjoyment of the other rights enshrined in this Constitution, as well as those of a fundamental character established in the international instruments [on] human rights, [applicable] to the Republic.

It observed that the Constitutional Chamber had expressly declined jurisdiction to entertain issues relating to the legality of the Concession.741 Hence, the TCA concluded that \u201c[t]he above shows that the Constitutional Chamber itself was always aware of its constitutional jurisdiction and never ventured into the scope of legality when assessing the Crucitas Mining Project, but made its assessment from the perspective of the violation or not of the fundamental rights, which is what proceeds in the case of an action for constitutional rights protection (*amparo*).\u201d742\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), pp. 53 *et seq.* (English), pp. 52 *et seq.* (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), p. 54 (English), p. 53 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n454.\n\nThe TCA further remarked that \u201cthe Political Constitution makes an important distinction between the powers assigned to the Constitutional Jurisdiction and the Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction. [...] This distinction within the scope of the competence of each of the mentioned bodies is what determines the lack of identity between the object and cause of what is heard by the Constitutional Chamber in the *amparos* cited and reviewed by the Contentious-Administrative Court in this proceeding.\u201d743 Finally, the TCA explained that its finding was consistent with the Administrative Chamber\u2019s jurisprudence.744\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), p. 46 (English), p. 46 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), pp. 50-51 (English), pp. 50-51 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n455.\n\nOn appeal, the Administrative Chamber upheld the TCA\u2019s decision. It stressed that the *res judicata* principle \u201cimplies the prohibition to discuss, again, a controversy already resolved by the competent jurisdictional body [...] [which] requires full coincidence between the decided controversy and the one subsequently filed.\u201d745 The Administrative Chamber further explained that only decisions of the Constitutional Chamber setting a precedent on the interpretation of fundamental rights and constitutional rules have *erga omnes* effects.746 Relying on its own case law, the Administrative Chamber held that the *erga omnes* effects of the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s decisions did not extend to issues of legality.747\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas XVI, p. 34 (PDF) (English), p. 157 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas XVI, pp. 35-36 (PDF) (English), pp. 158-159 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas XVI, p. 36 (PDF) (English), p. 159 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\n456.\n\nThe Administrative Chamber went on to compare the issues resolved by the TCA with those resolved by the Constitutional Chamber in the decisions invoked by the Claimant.748 It noted in particular that the Constitutional Chamber had declared that \u201c[the] assess[ment and analysis of] whether a mining concession violates an executive decree [is not a matter of constitutionality but of legality].\u201d749 On this basis, the Administrative Chamber rejected Infinito\u2019s objection in the following terms:\n\nThus, as the Constitutional Chamber did not assess this point as it found that it was a question of legality, there can be no res judicata or binding pronouncement on this matter. Now, beyond the reasons given by the TCA to declare the nullity of the decree of national convenience and public interest and the change in land use and felling authorization the truth is that their validity depends on the validity of the concession act [...]. Therefore, in that respect and from this perspective, there can be no res judicata or binding effect either.750\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas XVII, pp. 37-38 (PDF) (English), pp. 162-164 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Resolution No. 2010-014009 (24 August 2010), Whereas V, Exh. **R-0028.** *See also,* quote in Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), p. 38 (PDF) (English), p. 164 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0261**\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas XVIII, pp. 164-165 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0261** (Tribunal translation).\n\n457.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal finds that both the TCA and the Administrative Chamber adequately assessed Industrias Infinito\u2019s *res judicata* objection on the basis of the applicable law, and that their reasoning complies with what could be expected from any competent judge. As the Claimant\u2019s own experts, Messrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas, have explained, the *res judicata* principle is intended to prevent another court from issuing a decision on a matter on which the Constitutional Chamber has already decided.751 The TCA\u2019s and the Administrative Chambers\u2019 assessment was directed precisely at determining whether this was so: after summarizing the parties\u2019 positions and defining the applicable legal standard under Costa Rican law, they reviewed the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decisions in order to determine whether they had definitively settled the issue of the 2008 Concession\u2019s validity. They concluded that they had not. As a matter of procedure, the Tribunal can find no fault with either court\u2019s conduct, nor can it find their conclusions unreasonable.\n\nCER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 256.\n\n458.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal has confirmed for itself that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is not inconsistent with the previous decisions of the Constitutional Chamber identified by the Claimant in connection with the legality of the 2008 Concession.\n\n459.\n\nThe Claimant essentially argues that the Constitutional Chamber held that (i) the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project (2002 Constitutional Chamber Decision);752 (ii) that the Crucitas Project \u201ccould proceed through the EIA approval process\u201d (2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, as confirmed by the 2007 Constitutional Chamber Decision);753 and, (iii) that the Crucitas Project was \u201cenvironmentally sound, constitutional and lawful, and upheld the exploitation concession and all of the Project\u2019s approvals\u201d (2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision).754 The Claimant contends that, by annulling the 2008 Concession because the 2002 Moratorium was still in force when that Concession was granted, the Administrative Chamber rendered a decision on matters that the Constitutional Chamber had already settled.\n\nC-Mem.

The latter\u2019s interpretation of the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s Decisions is at odds with their plain language.\n\n461.\n\nFirst, the Constitutional Chamber never determined that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project:\n\na. In its 2002 Decision, the Constitutional Chamber merely found that the 2002 Moratorium did not infringe any of the petitioner\u2019s (or Industrias Infinito\u2019s755) constitutional rights because it contained a grandfathering provision to protect vested rights.756 In other words, the Constitutional Chamber rendered a decision *in abstracto* as to the constitutionality of the 2002 Moratorium. In any event, the Constitutional Chamber could not have assessed in 2002 whether the 2002 Moratorium applied to the 2008 Concession, which was granted several years later.\n\nb. Further, in its August 2010 Decision in response to the Murillo Amparo, the Constitutional Chamber expressly declined to determine whether the 2002 Moratorium applied to the 2008 Concession, holding that \u201cit is not a constitutional matter, but a matter of legality to assess whether a mining concession violates an executive decree.\u201d757 As a result, the Constitutional Chamber declined to entertain the applicant\u2019s claim.758 It follows that the Constitutional Chamber did not decide whether the 2008 Concession had been granted in violation of the 2002 Moratorium.\n\nWhile Industrias Infinito was not a party to these proceedings, the Constitutional Chamber expressly referred to it in its recitals as one of the potentially affected companies.

While it is true that through this decree the Executive declares a national moratorium on open-pit gold mining in the national territory for an undefined term (article 1), it is also true that in Transitional provision 1 it expressly establishes that all \u2018rights acquired before the publication of this decree will be respected.\u2019\u201d)\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Resolution No. 2010-014009 (24 August 2010), Whereas V, Exh. **R-0028**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Resolution No. 2010-014009 (24 August 2010), Exh. **R-0028**.\n\n462.\n\nSecond, there is no basis to conclude that the Constitutional Chamber found that the 2002 Concession could definitely proceed through the EIA approval process. It is undisputed that, in its 2004 Decision, the Constitutional Chamber annulled the 2002 Concession because it had been granted without a prior EIA.759 It is true that the Constitutional Chamber added that this annulment was \u201cwithout prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment may determine,\u201d760 which suggests that the Chamber intended for the Concession to be reinstated if a positive EIA was concluded. However, even if this was the case, it does not alter the fact that the 2002 Concession was thereby annulled and deprived of effectiveness.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Operative Part, p. 32 (PDF) (English), pp. 66-67 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Operative Part, Exh. **C-0116***.* (The Tribunal notes that it has used the Respondent\u2019s English translation at R-Mem. Jur., \u00b6 62).\n\n463.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d statement amounted to a declaration of relative, as opposed to absolute, nullity. It contends that, as a result, the 2002 Concession could have been cured *(convalidada)* and could have continued in place, with a vested right to exploit the mine despite the 2002 Moratorium. However, the Constitutional Chamber expressly declined its jurisdiction to specify whether the nullity of the 2002 Concession was absolute or relative. Indeed, when Industrias Infinito requested the Constitutional Chamber to clarify its 2004 Decision, that Chamber (through its 2007 Decision) found that whether the approval of an EIA could remedy the annulment of the 2002 Concession, or whether the nullity it had declared was absolute or relative, were matters \u201cnot within the jurisdiction of this court\u2019 because they pertained to the legality of an administrative act and were thus of the exclusive competence of the administrative courts.761 Specifically, the Constitutional Chamber stated:\n\nII.- As for determining the nature of the annulment \u2014whether absolute or relative\u2014of [the 2002 Concession] [...] these are aspects related to the validity of the administrative decree elements whose content and transcendence may not and must not be discussed or determined by this appeal as it constitutes a matter of administrative nature that exceeds the competence of this Court. [...] The possibility of restoring the concession or the impossibility of doing so by virtue of being an absolute or relative nullity, is not part of the object of the writ of amparo, but rather is an issue that must be determined in the administrative area or in ordinary jurisdiction. [...] The decision resolving the amparo, in accordance with its factual records and applicable legal rules, [does not] contemplate the determination of the absolute or relative nature of the errors or omissions contained in the concession; that determination is not within the jurisdiction of this court, since the possibility of correcting or rectifying a defect of legal [significance], or the impossibility of doing so, is an issue that must be resolved in compliance with the definitions and limits contained in ordinary legislation. The nature of these procedural defects, when applying the traditional terminology in relation to relative or absolute errors, is that they are conceptual categories whose application corresponds to the processes developed before the ordinary jurisdiction. For this reason, this motion is to be rejected in every respect.762\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision No. 2007-7973 (7 June 2007), Whereas II, Exh. **C-0164**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision No. 2007-7973 (7 June 2007), Whereas II, Exh. **C-0164.**\n\n464.\n\nThird, while in April 2010 the Constitutional Chamber held that the 2008 Concession did not violate the constitutional right to a healthy environment,763 it did not declare that it complied with all legality requirements, as the Claimant contends. Indeed, the Constitutional Chamber repeatedly stated that it was not competent to rule on the technical requirements of the EIA, or on whether the Government agencies had assessed them correctly.764 The Chamber\u2019s assessment was limited to verifying whether the relevant Government agencies had assessed the Project in accordance with the relevant procedures, relied on technical evidence and complied with other relevant requirements, such as community participation.765 Once that had been verified, the Chamber relied on the Government\u2019s technical assessment of the environmental risk, and declared itself incompetent to determine if the technical requirements had been met, noting that any technical infringement should be taken to the appropriate bodies.766\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Whereas CXXI, Exh. **C-0225** and **R-0096**.

(\u201cThe Chamber [definitely] concludes that a constitutional violation occurs in the case under review with regard to granting environmental viability without the prior knowledge or approval of the hydrogeological studies of the entire area of the Crucitas Mining Project from the National Groundwater, Irrigation, and Drainage Service, without such a declaration, [...] having [had] a nullifying effect on the Environmental Impact Assessment nor a retroactive effect on the proceedings at the moment of presenting said assessment, precisely because this body still endorsed them extemporaneously. Moreover, in accordance with the considerations given in this ruling, the remaining alleged violations of the law for a healthy and ecologically balanced environment under the terms outlined by Article 50 of the Political Constitution and constitutional jurisprudence are dismissed.

As to the Chamber\u2019s discussion of the change of land use and felling authorization, the ultimate purpose of the Chamber\u2019s assessment was to determine whether the authorization had been arbitrary, not whether it had reached the right conclusions.768\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Whereas CIII, Exh. **C-0225** and **R-0096** (\u201cthe Chamber observes that the referenced decree does, in fact, demonstrate the execution of a previous [work] that allowed the administration to determine the existence of socio-economic benefits outweighing the eventual environmental costs.

Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas, when they assert that \u201c[t]his judgment [...] established that the Crucitas Mine exploitation concession was fully compliant with the law, both from the legal and from the constitutional point of view.\u201d769 The Constitutional Chamber expressly limited its competence to determining whether the Crucitas Project was constitutional. It is true that, to do so, it had to assess whether Industrias Infinito and the Government had complied with the relevant procedures and whether the decisions of the governmental agencies were based on evidence. However, it carried out a *prima facie* assessment, which relied on the Government\u2019s technical appreciation of that evidence. The Chamber did not attempt - and indeed, explicitly refused - to decide if the technical criteria required by law had been fulfilled.\n\nCER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6 102.\n\n467.\n\nIt is also true that the Constitutional Chamber made several findings of fact with respect to the Project\u2019s environmental viability.770 While the Tribunal fails to understand the purpose of the Constitutional Chamber doing so, it remains that the latter left the validity of the 2008 Concession open, and expressly noted that allegations of non-conformity should be brought to the relevant authorities, namely, the administrative courts. Be this as it may, the Administrative Chamber did not confirm the TCA\u2019s findings on environmental viability; it limited itself to assessing whether the 2008 Concession was valid in light of the 2002 Moratorium.771\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Whereas LXXX, Exh. **C-0225** and **R-0096** (\u201cSo, this technical consideration, as well as the limited impact that climate change would have on the project area during its execution and closing phase determines that it should mitigate significantly the concern that was raised at the hearing on this aspect because according to this, the technical studies determine that the risk for the Mining Project is minimum, and with it, removing the given risk of drainage acid with [due to] the climate change.\u201d); Whereas LXXXIV (\u201cSo, taking into account the evaluations contained in the Environmental Impact Assessment, as well as those indicated in other technical documents provided, there is evidence that the risk of rupture of the dam of the tailings reservoir or overflow of the same reservoir is minimal, and would have a limited effect on the terrestrial and water environment. In any case, they would be temporary and reversible. In this sense, [no] constitutional violation is [found] with respect to the assessment carried out.\u201d); Whereas LXXXVI (\u201c[T]he technical test attached to the record is highly favorable to the use of the system reported by the appellee to the treatment and disposal of cyanide, as well as to the management and safety plans that will be implemented to prevent acid drainage of rocks as that feared [by the appellants due to] accidents or as the product of seismic events. [The coincidence] to and complementarily of the concerned reports, [allows] the Chamber [...] to conclude that handling the cyanide in the foreseen manner will certainly substantially lower the contamination risk by cyanide, both on the aquifer and in general, because technically it has been shown that cyanide will be destroyed and properly removed from the sterile material.\u201d); Whereas CV (\"To conclude [...] the Chamber establishes that the survival of the yellow almendro tree is ensured, as the authorized felling has no negative determin[ing] impact for the population of this species, nor is it barred due to its absent relation to nesting and breeding sites for the great green macaw.\u201d); CVI (\u201cFurthermore, it has been demonstrated that this almendro tree felling is not categorized as certain threat to the existence and survival of the great green macaw, since it has been proved that the bird does not nest in those trees which were authorized to fell, but rather it only arrives to the Crucitas area during non-breeding seasons and when the almendro tree does not bear fruit, by which in this season its food supply comes from the fruit of more than thirty varieties of trees in the area.\u201d)\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 285-286; Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas LIII, p. 243 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 79 (PDF) (English); Whereas LX, p. 257 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 86 (PDF) (English), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\n468.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal does not find that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was inconsistent with previous rulings of the Constitutional Chamber.\n\n*(ii) Is the Costa Rican Judicial System Structurally Flawed?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Costa Rican judicial system is structurally flawed because it does not provide any \u201cmechanism to resolve the Administrative Chamber\u2019s failure to respect constitutional *cosa juzgada.\u201d772* Its argument has two prongs. First, the Claimant argues that, unlike other judicial systems, in Costa Rica there is no body responsible for resolving inconsistencies between the decisions by the different Chambers of the Supreme Court.773 Second, it contends that the only available remedy to address conflicting decisions - an action for unconstitutionality - was ineffective.774 The Claimant explains that it challenged the TCA\u2019s interpretation of the constitutional principle of *res judicata* before the Constitutional Chamber but that such Chamber dismissed the challenge on admissibility grounds.775 As a result, Industrias Infinito had no remedies left to seek the resolution of the inconsistencies between the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s prior Decisions.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 401.\n\nC-Mem.

The Tribunal does not share this view for the following reasons.\n\n471.\n\nFirst, the premise of the Claimant\u2019s argument has failed. As discussed above, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is not in conflict with any decision by the Constitutional Chamber. In particular, the Constitutional Chamber only ruled on the Crucitas Project\u2019s constitutionality; it did not rule on the 2008 Concession\u2019s legality or on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to that Concession. Hence, there is no conflict of decisions that requires resolutions.\n\n472.\n\nSecond, leaving aside that first reason, the record shows that such jurisdictional conflicts are unlikely to arise. As Dr. Le\u00f3n, who was the President of the Administrative Chamber in 2010 and 2011, explains, the Constitutional Chamber has no jurisdiction over the legality of administrative acts under the Constitution and the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction.776 This is consistent with the TCA\u2019s and the Administrative Chamber\u2019s reasoning in their respective 2010 and 2011 Decisions. It is also in conformity to the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s repeated assertions that it was not competent to determine matters of legality, as discussed in the preceding section.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Dr. Calzada, who was the President of the Constitutional Chamber between 2008 and 2012, has testified that the Constitutional Chamber has the power to define its own jurisdiction and may thus decide to address matters of legality that are relevant to determining whether there has been a violation of a constitutional right.777 Dr. Calzada referred to this as a \u201cgray [sic] area\u201d (*zona lim\u00edtrofe*)that may give rise to a jurisdictional conflict.778 While this may be so, the Tribunal cannot fail to notice that Dr. Calzada presided the Constitutional Chamber when it issued the April 2010 Decision, where the Chamber repeatedly stated that it was not competent to rule on technical matters, which it characterized as *\u201casunto[s] de legalidad ordinaria\"* (matters of ordinary legality).779 The Tribunal thus concludes that a jurisdictional conflict could only arise, if at all, in the event that the Constitutional Chamber, when exercising its power to define its own jurisdiction, were to determine that it must rule on a matter of legality in order to decide on the breach of a constitutional right.\n\nCER-Calzada 1, \u00b6\u00b6 87-98.\n\nCER-Calzada 1, \u00b6 90.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (16 April 2010), Whereas CIII, Exh. **C-0225** and **R-0096**.\n\n474.\n\nThird, in the rare event that such a jurisdictional conflict might arise, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Costa Rican judicial system would not provide a mechanism to resolve it. As Dr. Le\u00f3n explains, a party may file an action against jurisprudence *(acci\u00f3n contra la jurisprudencia)* if it considers that a court decision is unconstitutional.780 Indeed, Dr. Calzada cites a decision of the Constitutional Chamber in which it declared that a ruling by the TCA had violated constitutional *cosa juzgada.781*\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 317-323.\n\nCER1-Calzada 1, \u00b6 99, Supreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision No. 2014-128-25 (6 August 2014), Whereas IX, p. 42 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 4 (PDF) (English), Exh. **C-0415** (\u201cAdditionally, it must be noted that the position taken in the administrative decision regarding the environmental viability was repeated and upheld by the judgment in the report submitted to this Chamber on [the] occasion [of this *amparo*]*.* Thus the situation, without doubt, in the opinion of the Constitutional Chamber, constitutes a clear violation of the fundamental [right to the] authority of *cosa juzgada.*\u201d)\n\n475.\n\nHowever, pursuant to Articles 75 and 77 of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction, this action must relate to an ongoing proceeding to be admissible;782 the Constitutional Chamber cannot enjoin a proceeding that has already been completed by another Chamber of the Supreme Court.783 According to Dr. Le\u00f3n, \u201c[t]he Constitutional Chamber can only undertake the action of unconstitutionality against a jurisprudential line (or a law), when it is a reasonable means to protect the right or interest that is considered as injured. For the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber to be useful and applicable to the [underlying proceeding], it is necessary that [the latter] has not been resolved.\u201d784\n\nLaw on Constitutional Jurisdiction, Law No. 7135 (10 October 1989), Articles 75 and 77, Exh. **C-0016**.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 319-320.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6 323.\n\n476.\n\nHere, Industrias Infinito filed its action of unconstitutionality on 11 November 2011, while the proceedings before the Administrative Chamber were still pending. However, the Administrative Chamber ruled on the challenge against the 2010 TCA Decision on 30 November 2011. As the underlying proceeding had therefore been resolved, the Constitutional Chamber could no longer rule on the matter and thus considered it inadmissible.785 The Court reasoned as follows:\n\nIt must be emphasized that in this case, [the discussion in the jurisdictional context has been exhausted]. That is to say, a firm [judgment] was [rendered] [and therefore] it was [legally] impossible [for] an action of unconstitutionality [to develop], in some context, its incidental role. If this was [decided] on [the] substance, this would not affect at all the legal relations regulated by the [decision] of the contentious administrative [tribunal] and the basic sense of this procedural instrument would be lost.786\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (19 June 2013), Exh. **C-0283**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (19 June 2013), Whereas III, Exh, **C-0283** (Tribunal\u2019s translation in brackets).\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s experts, Messrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas do not object to Dr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s interpretation of the Law on Constitutional Jurisdiction or to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision. Rather, they argue that \u201c[t]he Administrative Chamber, knowing that Industrias Infinito S.A., would bring the unconstitutionality action against its jurisprudence alleging *cosa juzgada* of the judgments of the Constitutional Chamber as the communication that initiated the proceeding alleged this unconstitutionality, hastened to resolve the appeal so that the action was left without procedural support and the Constitutional Chamber was forced to, as was done, reject the action for lack of a procedural mechanism. With it, it avoided that the Chamber could annul its prior jurisprudence on the matter and would necessarily be forced to annul the judgment of the Contentious Administrative Tribunal.\u201d787\n\nCER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6 115.\n\n478.\n\nHowever, the Claimant has adduced no evidentiary support for these statements. There is nothing on record (other than Messrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas\u2019s report) indicating that the Administrative Chamber intentionally hastened to issue its Decision for the sole purpose of rendering Industrias Infinito\u2019s unconstitutionality action ineffective.\n\n479.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that there is a mechanism to resolve conflicts of competence between the Constitutional Chamber and administrative courts which must be exercised while the administrative proceedings are ongoing. This necessarily implies that an injured party cannot challenge the unconstitutionality of a decision of the Administrative Chamber because, as it is the highest administrative court, the matter will be closed by the time it has ruled on a matter. The question thus arises whether this limitation to the conflict resolution mechanism constitutes a denial of justice. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not consider that it does.\n\n480.\n\nFourth and finally, the Tribunal finds that the lack of a specific body responsible for resolving conflicts of jurisdiction between the Supreme Court\u2019s chambers cannot by itself amount to a denial of justice.\n\n481.\n\nCiting Paulsson, the Claimant argues that \u201cthis lack of a \u2018reasonably available national mechanism to correct the challenged action\u2019 is a systemic failure of Costa Rica\u2019s legal system.\u201d788 However, Paulsson\u2019s full statement (\u201c[i]nternational law attaches state responsibility for judicial action only if it is shown that there was no reasonably available national mechanism to correct the challenged action\u201d789) relates to the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies, which is a different matter. Paulsson did not affirm, as the Claimant suggests, that the absence of a court similar to the French *Tribunal des conflits* amounts to a denial of justice*.*\n\nC-Rej. Jur., \u00b6 319, citing J. Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 100, Exh. **CL-0205**.\n\nJ. Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 100, Exh. **CL-0205**.\n\n482.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on *Dan Cake* to submit that a denial of justice can occur when \u201c[t]he absence of any reasonably available further recourse against the Court order is such that, in the circumstances of this case, the breakdown must be treated as \u2018systemic\u2019.\u201d790 The *Dan Cake* tribunal indeed reached this conclusion after having identified two fundamental flaws in Hungary\u2019s judicial system. First, the local bankruptcy court refused without proper justification to convene a composition hearing (through which the investor could have sought to reach a settlement with its creditors). Second, Hungary\u2019s judicial system provided no means to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.791 This decision cannot be applied by analogy in the present case, where the Claimant had access to an appeal (more specifically, to a *recurso de casaci\u00f3n* or annulment action) before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 627, citing *Dan Cake,* \u00b6 154, Exh. **CL-0031**.\n\n*Dan Cake,* \u00b6\u00b6 54, 55, 150, Exh. **CL-0031**.\n\n483.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, only a lack of remedy within the host State\u2019s judicial system that deprives an investor from a fair opportunity to plead its case or implies that access to justice is virtually non-existent would amount to a denial of justice. That is not the case here. As discussed in the preceding section, Industrias Infinito raised the *res judicata* objection before the TCA and then again before the Administrative Chamber and both courts considered it. Even in the absence of a court such as the French *Tribunal des conflicts,* the Respondent\u2019s judicial system provided the Claimant with several instances and remedies to address the alleged jurisdictional conflict.\n\n484.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is in line with the decision in *Philip Morris,* where the tribunal held that the lack of a mechanism for resolving conflicts between the administrative and civil courts did not amount to a denial of justice:792\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is unusual that the Uruguayan judicial system separates out the mechanisms of review in this way, without any system for resolving conflicts of reasoning. The Tribunal believes, however, that it would not be appropriate to find a denial of justice because of this discrepancy. The Claimants were able to have their day (or days) in court, and there was an available judicial body with jurisdiction to hear their challenge to the 80/80 Regulation and which gave a properly reasoned decision. The fact that there is no further recourse from the TCA decision, which did not follow the reasoning of the SCJ, seems to be a quirk of the judicial system.\n\n*Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v.

As a result, Industrias Infinito could not respond to this issue in writing and was thus \u201cdenied its greatest opportunity to address the application of the moratorium in detail.\u201d794 The Claimant argues that \u201c[t]his lack of procedural fairness was not cured before the Administrative Chamber, given that the Administrative Chamber proceeding was an appeal rather than a hearing at first instance.\u201d795 While the Claimant has raised this argument as part of its expropriation claim and has not expressly argued that this amounts to a denial of justice, as it relates to an alleged procedural unfairness, the Tribunal will address it here.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 283.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 182, 283.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 283.\n\n487.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the Claimant has not established that the TCA or the Administrative Chamber have breached any rule of due process.796 The Claimant has not explained how the TCA departed from Costa Rican procedural law, nor has it proved that it had no opportunity to make submissions on this matter. To the contrary, the record suggests that Industrias Infinito was aware of this argument prior to the hearing as it already asserted that the 2002 Moratorium was not applicable to it in its Answer to APREFLOFAS\u2019 petition before the TCA.797\n\nWhile the Tribunal\u2019s analysis focuses on the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, it finds that any breaches of due process by the TCA that might not have been addressed or cured by the Administrative Chamber could have relevance to whether the Respondent denied justice to the Claimant.\n\nIndustrias Infinito, Answer to Jorge Lobo's Request for Annulment (23 August 2010), p. 35, Exh. **R-0030**.\n\n488.\n\nIn any event, any failure by the TCA to comply with due process would have occurred before the cut-off date and the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over it. The relevant question is whether the Administrative Chamber failed to remedy this alleged breach of due process. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, such a failure is not established. In fact, the record shows that Industrias Infinito made comprehensive submissions on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium in front of the Administrative Chamber,798 which the Chamber addressed in its Decision.799\n\nSubmissions of Industrias Infinito S.A. to the Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), File No. 08-1282-1027-CA (18 January 2011), pp. 876-903, Exh. **C-0248**.\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas IV, pp. 115-116 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 13 (PDF) (English), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\n489.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not established a procedural breach by the TCA or the Administrative Chamber that could amount to a denial of justice in relation to the application of the 2002 Moratorium.\n\n*c. Did the Respondent Commit a Substantive Denial of Justice ?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision amounts to a substantive denial of justice because the court applied the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project in violation of Costa Rican law.800 Relying on the expert report of Messrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is contrary to Costa Rican law because:801\n\na. Costa Rica\u2019s Constitution prohibits the retroactive application of laws to investors with acquired rights.\n\nb. On its face, the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to Industrias Infinito\u2019s rights, which were acquired before the Moratorium was decreed, as the Constitutional Chamber confirmed in 2002 and 2010.\n\nc. The 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the 2002 Concession on a relative, rather than absolute basis, \u201cwithout prejudice to the findings of the Environmental Impact Study,\u201d which meant that Industrias Infinito\u2019s acquired rights had not been extinguished.\n\nd. The application of the 2002 Moratorium was contrary to binding decisions of the Constitutional Chamber, and thus violated the principles of *cosa juzgada* and *erga omnes* effects.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6\u00b6 403-411.\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 410. *See*, in the same vein, CER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6\u00b6 199-212; CER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 2, \u00b6\u00b6 43-49.\n\n491.\n\nRelying on *Arif, Azinian* and *Oostergetel,* the Claimant submits that the Administrative Chamber\u2019s cancellation of the 2008 Concession when Industrias Infinito had vested rights within the meaning of the Mining Code is \u201can inappropriate and egregious misapplication of Costa Rican law\u201d that amounts to a denial of justice.802\n\nC-CM Jur., \u00b6 408; *Arif,* \u00b6 442, Exh. **CL-0014**; *Azinian,* \u00b6 103, Exh. **CL-0017**; *Oostergetel,* \u00b6 274, Exh. **RL-0017**.\n\n492.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that there has been a substantive denial of justice. It argues that the Administrative Chamber \u201ccorrectly determined that [Industrias Infinito] did not have vested rights that would be protected under the Grandfathering Provision of the 2002 Moratorium.\u201d803 The Administrative Chamber found that the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the 2002 Concession with retroactive effects (annulment *ab initio),* and that Industrias Infinito \u201cdid not have an automatic right to an exploitation concession by virtue of the exploration permit that it held at one point.\u201d804\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 172.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 173.\n\n493.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the Claimant is not challenging the conduct, independence or good faith of the Costa Rican courts; it is merely in disagreement with the administrative courts\u2019 decisions.805 According to the Respondent, \u201c[j]ust because the Claimant does not agree that the 2011 Administrative Chamber should have reached its decision does not make the decision a denial of justice.\u201d806 The Respondent concludes that \u201c[t]he Claimant\u2019s claims are so far from meeting the threshold for a substantive denial of justice that they can be properly described as frivolous.\u201d807\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 474-475.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 474.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 475.\n\n494.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Respondent has not engaged in a substantive denial of justice.\n\n495.\n\nFirst, as was discussed above, the Constitutional Chamber made no definitive findings on the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project. In its 2002 Decision, the Constitutional Chamber merely stated that the 2002 Moratorium was not unconstitutional because it contained a grandfathering provision; in its 2004 Decision, it did not discuss the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, and in its August 2010 Decision, it declined to determine whether the 2002 Moratorium applied to the 2008 Concession.808 The TCA was thus the first judicial authority to rule on this matter. There can be thus no breach of the principles of *cosa juzgada* and *erga omnes* effects in this respect.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 461-463.\n\n496.\n\nSecond, after carefully reviewing the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the Tribunal cannot conclude that these courts applied Costa Rican law incorrectly. The 2010 TCA Decision, which the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision confirmed and made irreversible, devoted five pages to the Government\u2019s failure to apply the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project.809 Relying on Article 13 of the General Law of Public Administration,810 the TCA explained that under the principle of non-derogability of rules (*principio de inderogabilidad singular de la norma*) \u201cthe public authority cannot issue resolutions for a specific case whose contents ignore or do not apply what the same public authority had previously decided to the contrary in a general act.\u201d811 The TCA further noted that, in accordance with the 2002 Moratorium Decree\u2019s First Transitory Provision, all procedures related to open-pit gold exploration and exploitation pending before the DGM and the SETENA would be suspended, and all rights acquired before the publication of that decree would be respected. The TCA also noted that the 2002 Moratorium was lifted on 4 June 2008, and was thus in place from June 2002 to June 2008.812\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, p. 63 (English), p. 63 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\nGeneral Law of Public Administration, Law No. 6227 (5 February 1978), Article 13, Exh. **C-0014** (\u201c1. The Administration will be subject, in general, to all the written and unwritten rules of the administrative system, and to the private law supplementary thereof, without being able to repeal or not apply them for specific cases. 2. The previous rule will also be applied in relation to the regulations, whether they come from the same authority, whether they come from a higher or lower competent authority.\u201d) (Tribunal translation)\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, p. 64 (English), p. 63 (Spanish), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, p. 64 (Spanish), p. 65 (English), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n497.\n\nThe TCA then found that the 2002 Concession had been annulled by the Constitutional Chamber in 2004. In the TCA\u2019s opinion, this nullity was absolute and applied *ab initio.* With the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s declaration of nullity, Industrias Infinito\u2019s right to the exploitation concession thus disappeared. Hence, when in April 2008, the Government decided to \u201cconvert\u201d Industrias Infinito\u2019s concession, the latter had no vested rights. Accordingly, the TCA concluded that the approval of the EIA, the approval of the changes to the Project, and the granting of the 2008 Concession (all of which had occurred while the 2002 Moratorium was in force) had violated the principle of non-derogability of rules and were thus null and void.813\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, pp. 63-65 (Spanish), pp. 63-66 (English), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n498.\n\nThe TCA dismissed Industrias Infinito\u2019s argument that an exploration permit automatically grants the permit holder the right to an exploitation concession. It held that, under a systematic interpretation of the Mining Code, the right to explore is different and independent from the right to exploit. Pursuant to Articles 23(b) and 26 of the Mining Code, an exploitation concession will only be granted to an exploration permit holder if the requirements listed in Articles 8 and 9 of the Regulation to the Mining Code are fulfilled.814 The TCA therefore found that Industrias Infinito\u2019s submission that it had acquired exploitation rights as an exploration permit holder was \u201cabsolutely unfounded and, in addition, [it] d[id] not conform to reality.\u201d815 Accordingly, the TCA concluded that Industrias Infinito had no acquired right within the meaning of the Mining Code when it applied to validate its concession on 30 May 2007.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, pp. 65-67 (Spanish), pp. 66-67 (English), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, p. 65 (Spanish), p. 66 (English), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n499.\n\nThe TCA further considered that the conversion of the 2002 Concession had been unlawful, *inter alia* because such mechanism could not apply to acts which had been declared null and void by a court, as was the case here, because such a declaration implies that the act has been eliminated from the legal system. It also found that it did not follow from the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d statement that such court regarded the nullity as relative, or that the 2002 Concession could be converted.816\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XIV, pp. 76-77 (Spanish), pp. 76-77 (English), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n500.\n\nFinally, as discussed in the preceding section, the TCA assessed and rejected Industrias Infinito\u2019s *res judicata* objection. When discussing the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium, the TCA once again stressed that the Constitutional Chamber had expressly referred the application of the 2002 Moratorium and the conversion of the concession to the administrative courts, which were the competent authorities to resolve these matters.817\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Whereas XI, p. 67 (Spanish), p. 68 (English), Exh. **C-0239**.\n\n501.\n\nThe Administrative Chamber confirmed the TCA\u2019s reasoning in this respect. It undertook an in-depth analysis of the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project, focusing on the principle of non-derogability of rules, and concluded that (i) an exploration permit does not automatically ensure its holder that it will be granted an exploitation concession, which is subject to different and separate requirements; (ii) Industrias Infinito had no vested right to exploit the Crucitas mine following the annulment of the 2002 Concession, and (iii) the mechanism of conversion was not applicable in this case, and in any event the conversion would have been effective *ex nunc, i.e.,* as of the date of the conversion. The Administrative Chamber also noted that the 2002 Moratorium had been in effect from 12 June 2002 until 4 June 2008. Accordingly, the entire administrative process that led to the granting of the 2008 Concession, as well as the actual grant of that Concession, was in violation of the 2002 Moratorium and of the principle of non-derogability of rules.818 As this was the crucial element upon which the validity of the Concession depended, the Administrative Chamber considered that it did not need to address the remaining challenges against the TCA\u2019s decision.819\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas LIII-LX, pp. 243-257 (PDF) (Spanish), pp. 79-86 (PDF) (English), Exh. **C-0261** (\u201cit is clear that from the time the concession was annulled in 2004, it imposed a suspension of all administrative procedures subsequently initiated by IISA for the purpose of obtaining the exploitation concession. Nevertheless, the Public Administration, far from acting that way, continued [to move the process forward] until the issuance of Act R-217-2008-MINAE on 3pm on April 21, 2008, applying the conversion of the Act that originally approved the concession. With this procedure, the Public Administration breached the provisions of the transitory provision and, therefore, also the singular non-derogability principle of the regulation or Rule [...].\u201d)\n\nSupreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas LIII, p. 243 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 79 (PDF) (English); Whereas LX, p. 257 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 86 (English), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\n502.\n\nWhen assessing a claim for denial of justice, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis must focus on the judgment of the court ruling on the last remedy, *i.e.*, the Administrative Chamber Decision. Having assessed that decision, the Tribunal cannot discern the existence of a substantive denial of justice. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was premised on Costa Rican law and reasoned. While the Administrative Chamber\u2019s reasons and conclusions could be characterized as formalistic, there was no misapplication of domestic law. As discussed above, the Administrative Chamber did not violate *res judicata* in respect of the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium or the validity of the Concession, because the Constitutional Court had not adjudged these matters.\n\n503.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contention, the Administrative Chamber did not apply the 2002 Moratorium retroactively. While the 2002 Moratorium had been repealed when the 2008 Concession was granted, that repeal had not yet come into effect.\n\n504.\n\nIndustrias Infinito\u2019s argument was that it owned a vested right that was protected from the application of the 2002 Moratorium. The Administrative Chamber addressed this argument and concluded that Industrias Infinito did not own a vested right on the date when the 2002 Moratorium came into force, and thus could not be validly granted an exploitation concession while the 2002 Moratorium was in effect.\n\n505.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Administrative Chamber incurred in a substantive denial of justice.\n\n***(ii) Did the Respondent Otherwise Breach the FET Standard?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to whether the Respondent has treated the Claimant\u2019s investments unfairly and inequitably through conduct that does not amount to a denial of justice.\n\n507.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the \u201ccombined effect\u2019 of four of the challenged measures (*i.e.*, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision), together with \u201cthe Government\u2019s choice not to allow the project to proceed, violated the FET standard by breaching Infinito\u2019s legitimate expectations, failing to treat Infinito\u2019s investment in a consistent, predictable manner, and treating Infinito arbitrarily because the foundational measure served no rational purpose.\u201d820 The Claimant also argues that, through the 2015 TCA Damages Decision and the proceedings reinitiated thereafter the Respondent has continued to breach FET.821\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 590.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 612-613.\n\n508.\n\nTo assess whether the challenged measures were unfair and inequitable, the Tribunal must review the facts that led to those measures. Pursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, claims for breaches and damage in respect of which the Claimant had actual or constructive knowledge prior to 6 February 2011 are time-barred. However, to understand the context and reasoning of the challenged measures (of which three are judicial decisions that by nature rely on prior facts to reach their conclusions), the Tribunal must assess all of the facts that led to the challenged measures. A majority of the Tribunal has also determined that claims related to the annulment of the Concession by the Administrative Chamber on 30 November 2011 are not time-barred.\n\n509.\n\nAs discussed in Section V.D.3.b(ii)a *supra,* the Claimant\u2019s FET claim has two main elements, one related to the loss of the Concession (a) and another premised on the impossibility to reinitiate the process after the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (b). A third element relates to the 2015 TCA Damages decision and the proceedings that have been reinitiated thereafter (c), as discussed in Section V.D.3.b(vi) *supra.* The Tribunal will address these elements in turn.\n\n*a. Did the Respondent Treat the Claimant Unfairly and Inequitably in Relation to the Loss of the Concession?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nInfinito\u2019s FET claim in relation to the loss of the Concession has three prongs. It contends that the Respondent breached its legitimate expectations, failed to treat it consistently and predictably, and acted in an arbitrary manner.\n\n511.\n\nIn terms of legitimate expectations, the Claimant argues that \u201c[w]hen the Government\u2019s conduct is considered as a whole, it is clear that Infinito had an objectively reasonable legitimate expectation that it would be able to proceed with the Crucitas project in accordance with the Mining Code, which contained no moratorium at the time of investment.\u201d822 The Claimant has grounded this expectation on two elements: (i) the legal framework (and in particular the Mining Code) in force when it made its initial investment and (ii) the Government\u2019s conduct, which supported this expectation by making efforts to advance the Project.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 561.\n\n512.\n\nWith respect to the legal framework, the Claimant submits that it invested in reliance on the clear provisions of the Mining Code, pursuant to which an exploration permit holder would have the right to obtain an exploitation concession, provided it had discovered an exploitable deposit. The Claimant contends that this mechanism was established specifically to attract foreign investors such as itself,823 and constituted the *quid pro quo* upon which the granting of the exploitation concession was based.824 Based on this \u201cclear legal framework\u201d, the Claimant asserts that:\n\na. \u201c[W]hen Industrias Infinito obtained an exploration permit in January 1996, it legitimately expected to be able to conduct exploration work to search for minerals in the Crucitas project area and to receive an exploitation concession for the Crucitas project area once it proved the existence of deposits within the Crucitas project area.\u201d825\n\nb. It also \u201clegitimately expected that its rights could not be taken away except in accordance with the legal framework set out in the Mining Code then in effect,\u201d arguing that \u201c[i]t would not have invested in the project if its right to an exploitation concession and the exploitation concession itself could be arbitrarily revoked at any time by the application of a moratorium on open-pit mining.\u201d826 The Claimant notes in this respect that the Costa Rican Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o law shall have retroactive effect in prejudice to any person, or to his acquired patrimonial rights or to any consolidated legal situations.\u201d827\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 564.\n\nTr.

Merits, \u00b6 310.\n\nPolitical Constitution of the Republic of Costa Rica, Article 34, Exh. **C-0013**.\n\n513.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent\u2019s conduct should be assessed under the prism of legitimate expectations.\n\n514.\n\nFirst, as a matter of fact, Industrias Infinito was granted an exploitation concession in accordance with the Mining Code, not once, but twice. The problem was not the Government\u2019s refusal to grant this concession; it was that, in both instances, the Costa Rican courts found that concession to be flawed, and therefore annulled it. The Claimant\u2019s first expectation is therefore moot.\n\n515.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Claimant\u2019s second expectation qualifies as \u201clegitimate\u201d, as this term is understood in international investment law. Investment tribunals have consistently held that, to be protected under the FET standard, the expectation must have arisen from a specific assurance, commitment or representation given by the State on which the investor relied to make its investment.828\n\n*See*, *inter alia, Duke Energy Electroquil Partners* & *Electroquil S.A. v.

In particular, it received no specific assurances that \u201c[a]bsent any of the specific grounds set out in the Mining Code, and absent compliance with the associated annulment or cancellation process, an exploitation concession could not be annulled or cancelled.\u201d829 Indeed, none of the facts alleged by the Claimant amount to specific assurances from the Government that Industrias Infinito would be able to operate the Crucitas Project, that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to it, or that the concession could not be cancelled or annulled other than on the grounds set out in the Mining Code. In addition, many of the facts that the Claimant invokes as assurances occurred after its initial investment. Specifically:\n\na. The Claimant alleges that Minister of the Environment Rodr\u00edguez represented to Infinito in 2002 that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project.830 However, there is no evidence of this representation other than the witness testimony of Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez, who asserts that, during a meeting in the first quarter of 2003 after the 2002 Moratorium had entered into force, the Minister (i) \u201cconfirmed the Government\u2019s position against mining, but stated that acquired rights would be respected;\u201d (ii) \u201cdeclared that SETENA would continue with [the EIA] process and that his office would not intervene in the process;\u201d and (iii) \u201cexpressed that SETENA\u2019s decision would be respected.\u201d831 There is no documentary evidence of these statements, but in any event the Minister merely declared that acquired rights would be respected and that the Government would not interfere with the permitting process. He did not represent that Industrias Infinito had an acquired right to exploit the Crucitas Project.\n\nb. The Claimant further alleges that in August 2002 the Constitutional Chamber confirmed that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Crucitas Project.832 As discussed in paragraph 461.a *supra,* the Constitutional Court only held that the 2002 Moratorium was constitutional because it respected acquired rights; it did not say that Industrias Infinito held an acquired right.\n\nc. The Claimant relies on certain statements that President Pacheco made in May 2004, allegedly accepting that the Project could continue. Specifically, a news article reports the President as having stated that \u201cthere is no way of stopping something in progress, and if I had not kept the word of previous governments, then Costa Rica would have been subject of a multimillion dollar claim [...].\"833 Mr. Rauguth commented in this respect that he \u201cwas personally satisfied to learn that President Pacheco himself grudgingly acknowledged the legality of the project, and [he] viewed this as further indication that development of the Crucitas site would not be further delayed by questionable government and political intervention.\u201d834 However, this does not amount to an assurance that any permits or concessions granted would be immune from judicial scrutiny.\n\nd. The Claimant also submits that the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision (which annulled the 2002 Concession \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d to the EIA) constitutes an assurance that the project could proceed through the EIA approval process, even though the 2002 Moratorium was in effect.835 However, as noted in paragraph 462 *supra,* in 2004 the Constitutional Chamber did annul the 2002 Concession, and the meaning of its \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d statement is unclear. Moreover, in 2007 the Constitutional Chamber declared itself incompetent to clarify whether an EIA would cure the nullity,836 and in August 2010 it declared itself incompetent to determine whether the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Project.837\n\ne. Infinito stresses that the Minister of the Environment defended the legality and constitutionality of the 2002 Concession before the Constitutional Chamber during the proceedings that led to the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision.838 While this shows that the Government supported the Project or, at the very least, defended the legality of its actions, it is not equivalent to an assurance that the Project could proceed if the 2002 Concession was found to be flawed.\n\nf. The Claimant further notes that, following the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, \u201cInfinito and the Government proceeded on the mutual understanding that [Industrias Infinito] had the right to rectify the defect found by the Constitutional Chamber and have its exploitation concession restored.\u201d839 The Claimant points to (i) SETENA\u2019s review of Industrias Infinito\u2019s EIA spanning 22 months and including significant discussions with Industrias Infinito\u2019s representatives, visits to the Project site, and the largest public hearing in Costa Rica\u2019s history;840 (ii) SETENA\u2019s ultimate approval of the EIA for the Project in 2005, and the declaration by SETENA that the Project was environmentally viable;841 (iii) SETENA\u2019s review and approval of the EIA modification and its declaration that the modified Project was environmentally viable in February 2008;842 (iv) President Arias\u2019s decision to repeal the 2002 Moratorium in March of 2008, as part of a decree safeguarding the mining environment in Costa Rica;843 (v) President Arias and Minister Dobles\u2019s decision to restore Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploitation concession in April 2008 through the process of conversion;844 and (vi) the grant by SINAC of a land use change permit in October 2008, which was the last permit required before the construction of the mine could be completed.845 While the Tribunal agrees that these facts show the Government\u2019s understanding that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Project, they do not amount to an assurance that the Moratorium did not apply as a matter of law, nor did they guarantee that authorizations or concessions would be shielded from judicial scrutiny.\n\ng. The Claimant also relies on Minister Dobles\u2019 appearance before the Costa Rican Legislative Assembly in October 2008.846 It is true that Minister Dobles stated that \u201c[t]he processes [for the approval of the EIA and the granting of the exploitation concession], whose final acts [SETENA Resolution 170-08 and MINAE Resolution 217-08] are firm today, have [been carried out in] to a strict adherence to legal and constitutional regulations,\u201d and that \u201c[a]bsolutely all of the processes have been respected, and furthermore, the company has complied with all legal and regulatory requirements.\u201d847 However, these statements, which were not addressed to Infinito, cannot be construed as a guarantee that the Concession and related approvals would not be subject to judicial scrutiny, or that they would not be annulled if the courts found that some statutory or regulatory requirements had not been complied with.\n\nh. Finally, the Claimant argues that the 2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision \u201cconcluded that the project was environmentally sound, in compliance with Article 50 of the Political Constitution and that the exploitation concession and other project approvals were constitutional and lawful.\u201d848 As discussed in paragraphs 464-467 *supra,* the Constitutional Court only held that the Project did not violate the constitutional right to a healthy environment, but expressly declined its competence to opine on whether it met the (legal) technical requirements.849\n\nC-Mem.

However, the legal framework does not assist the Claimant. Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contentions, Articles 61 and 63 of the Mining Code do not provide an exhaustive list of the grounds on which a concession may be annulled or cancelled; they merely list examples of such grounds.850 Indeed, Article 61 makes it clear that concessions shall be null and void if they are granted in violation of \u201cthe law,\u201d not \u201cthis law.\u201d It is thus clear that, to be valid, exploitation concessions must meet all applicable legal requirements, not only those set out in the Mining Code. The Claimant could not have legitimately expected that its exploitation concessions would be immune from judicial scrutiny if they were granted in violation of applicable legal norms.\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 61, Exh. **C-0015** (\u201cPermits and concessions granted in contravention of the law shall be null, and especially in the following circumstances: [...]\u201d); Article 62 (\u201cExploration permits may be cancelled if the holder fails to comply with the obligations specified in this Law and its regulations, particularly in the following cases: [...].\u201d).\n\n519.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the 2002 Moratorium changed or \u201ceviscerated\u201d the legal framework. Yet, absent specific assurances, the FET standard does not protect expectations in relation to the stability of a State\u2019s legal framework.851 Unless they expressly undertake not to do so, States are free to modify the legal regime applicable at the time of the investment to the extent they do so within the limits prescribed by FET, *i.e.*, the evolution must not be unreasonable, discriminatory, disproportionate, or adopted contrary to due process.852\n\n*See e.g.,* *Parkerings,* \u00b6 332, Exh. **CL-0068**; *TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Award, 19 December 2013 (\"***TECO***\")*,* \u00b6 629, Exh. **CL-0165**; *Micula,* \u00b6 666, Exh. **CL-0060**. It is true that some decisions upheld legitimate expectations regarding legal frameworks deemed to (i) have contained specific guarantees; and/or (ii) have been adopted precisely to attract foreign investors and encourage their investments, which is not established to be the case of the Costa Rican Mining Code. *See e.g.* *LG&E Energy Corp, LG&E Capital Corp and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006 (\"***LG&E***\"), \u00b6 139, Exh. **CL-0053**; *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Partial Final Award, 6 May 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 248, 273, 292, Exh. **CL-0238**.\n\n*Parkerings*, \u00b6 332, Exh. **CL-0068**; *TECO,* \u00b6 630, Exh. **CL-0165**.\n\n520.\n\nMoreover, a prohibition of retroactivity, such as the one in Article 34 of the Costa Rican Constitution, usually does not prohibit the passing of legislation with effects for the future, at least when acquired rights are protected. Here, when Costa Rica modified its legal framework through the 2002 Moratorium, it did in fact respect acquired rights. It is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to exploitation concessions that had already been granted. It is for this reason that the Claimant believed that the 2002 Concession, which was granted prior to the enactment of the 2002 Moratorium, was not affected by it. However, as discussed in paragraphs 83, 497 and 501 *supra,* the Constitutional Court found that the 2002 Concession was null and void because it had been granted without a prior EIA, and the TCA and the Administrative Chamber found that this nullity was absolute and operated *ab initio.* Accordingly, the basis for Industrias Infinito\u2019s acquired rights disappeared. When a new concession was granted in 2008, the TCA and the Administrative Chamber held that the 2008 Concession was also null and void because it was granted while the 2002 Moratorium was in force.\n\n521.\n\nIn light of the preceding considerations, it is clear to the Tribunal that the loss of the Claimant\u2019s Concession was not caused by a modification of the legal framework. This is not a case of breach of legitimate expectations of legal stability. What is at stake here is something different: it is whether, when guiding the Claimant in its investment process and issuing the relevant permits, the Respondent acted reasonably, consistently, and in compliance with its own law, and whether its courts applied domestic law in conformity with Costa Rica\u2019s international obligation to accord FET to the Claimant\u2019s investment.\n\n522.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal starts by recalling that the Claimant invested in Costa Rica in 2000, when it acquired Industrias Infinito. In 1997, the then President of Costa Rica had declared mining to be an industry of national convenience.853\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 68.\n\n523.\n\nIndustrias Infinito held an exploration permit which had been granted in 1993, and had been extended to September 1999. Between 1993 and 2000, Industrias Infinito confirmed the existence of gold deposits. It applied for an exploitation concession on 18 December 1999, which it obtained in December 2001 and which became effective in January 2002 (\u201c**2002 Concession**\u201d).854 The 2002 Concession had a ten-year term, subject to extensions and one renewal, and allowed Industrias Infinito to extract, process and sell the minerals from the Las Crucitas gold deposit.855 The 2002 Concession specified that \u201c[t]he concession holder, prior to commencing the exploitation activities, shall obtain the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment, duly approved by the [SETENA]. Six months shall be granted for its submission to the [DGM].\u201d856\n\nRequest for Exploitation Concession, Industrias Infinito S.A.

Jur., \u00b6 62).\n\n525.\n\nTo assess the implications of this Decision, it is necessary to address the legal framework that governed exploitation concessions at the time. Article 23 of the Mining Code provides that an exploration permit holder \u201cshall have the right\u201d (or \u201cshall be entitled\u201d, according to the Claimant\u2019s translation), *inter alia,* to \u201c[r]eceive one or more exploitation concessions if [it] demonstrate[s] that one or more commercially viable mineral substances deposits exist and are located within the perimeter zone specified in their exploration permit [\u2026]\u201d859 However, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contentions, the Mining Code does not guarantee that an exploitation concession will be automatically granted under any circumstances. Article 26 makes it clear that, in order to obtain an exploitation concession, the exploration permit holder must have complied with the obligations and met the requirements set out in both the Mining Code and related Regulations.860 Indeed, the Claimants\u2019 own experts, Messrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas, confirm that the right to obtain an exploitation concession is not automatic.861\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 23(b), Exh. **C-0015** (\u201cAn exploration permit holder shall be specially entitled to the following: [...] (b) Receive one or more exploitation concessions if [it] demonstrate[s] that one or more commercially viable mineral substances deposits exist and are located within the perimeter zone specified in their exploration permit.\u201d)\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 26, Exh. **C-0015** (\u201cDuring the term of an exploration permit and up to sixty days after the expiration of the term or its extension, the holder shall be entitled to obtain an exploitation concession, provided that [it] ha[s] fulfilled [its] obligations and the requirements of this Law and its regulations.\u201d)\n\nCER-Hernandez-Rojas 2, \u00b6 80 (\u201cWe have not asserted, as expert Ubico rashly asserts, that the exploration permit automatically grants the right to exploitation, but we have done so regarding the right to obtain a final answer within the validly initiated concession procedure.\u201d)\n\n526.\n\nIt is undisputed that, on 17 December 2001, (the date on which Industrias Infinito was granted the 2002 Concession), the Mining Code did not require the approval of an EIA as a prerequisite for an exploitation concession. Article 34 of the Mining Code provided that \u201c[a]n exploitation concession holder shall be obliged: [...] To carry out a complete environmental impact study of the exploitation process in compliance with the requirements set forth in Article 97 and with the rules that regulate environmental pollution and the recovery of renewable natural resources.\u201d862 In other words, the Mining Code required those who had already obtained an exploitation concession to carry out an EIA. The 2002 Concession thus appeared to comply with the requirements set out in the Mining Code.\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 34(ch), Exh. **C-0015**.\n\n527.\n\nThis being so, it is undisputed that a new regulation to the Mining Code was issued in February or March 2001 (the \u201c**2001 Regulation**\u201d) which required that the EIA be approved prior to the granting of the concession.863 The Claimant argues that, pursuant to the transitory provisions of the 2001 Regulation, the new sequencing of the EIA did not apply to applications for exploitation concessions already submitted when the 2001 Regulation came into effect (as was the case with Industrias Infinito\u2019s application), and that those applications continued to be processed in accordance with the rules in place before the 2001 Regulation came into force.864 Transitory Provision I of the 2001 Regulation reads as follows:\n\nAll applications pending on the date of publication of this regulation, will continue their process with the regulations in force at the time of their application. However, once granted the right to a permit or concession, the work of supervision and control will be carried out pursuant to this regulation.865\n\nDecree No. 29300-MINAE (March 2001), Regulation to the Mining Code, Article 9, Exh. **C-0059.** The Tribunal notes that the date does not appear on the exhibit, but the Parties seem to agree that the decree is from March 2001. *See* Claimant\u2019s Consolidated List of Exhibits and R-Mem.

However, other documents on record refer to this decree as having been issued in February 2001. *See* Executive Decree No. 37225-MINAET, 23 July 2012, Exh. **R-0397** (referring in the *chapeau* to \u201cthe Regulation to the Mining Code, Executive Decree No. 29300-MINAE of 8 February 2001.\u201d)\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 109.\n\nDecree No. 29300-MINAE (March 2001), Regulation to the Mining Code, Transitory Provision I, Exh. **C-0059**.\n\n528.\n\nThe Constitutional Chamber did not refer to this transitory provision, but stated that \u201conce the exploitation concession is granted, the Administration retains the authority to revoke the exploitation concession for a breach of the obligations of the company listed in the preceding subparagraphs of [that] precept), 100 and 101 (sanctions and prohibitions), all from the Mining Code.\u201d866 By \u201cthat precept\u201d, the Tribunal understands the Constitutional Chamber to mean Article 9 of the 2001 Regulation, to which it had referred earlier in the paragraph. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that, on its own, this appears to amount to a retroactive application of the 2001 Regulation. However, the Constitutional Chamber also noted that the requirement that the EIA should be approved prior to the granting of the concession stemmed from the preventive principle in environmental matters, which had been \u201cabsorbed in constitutional jurisprudence\u201d under Article 50 of the Constitution since 1995,867 but the excerpt quoted by the Constitutional Chamber did not refer specifically to the requirement of an EIA.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Section IV, p. 27 (PDF) (English), p. 61 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\nSupreme Court (Constitutional Chamber), Decision (26 November 2004), Section IV, pp. 23-26 (PDF) (English), pp. 57-60 (PDF) (Spanish), Exh. **C-0116**.\n\n529.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that \u201cthe requirement to present an EIA prior to the granting of an exploitation concession had been firmly established in Costa Rica\u2019s legal order since 1993.\u201d868 The Respondent cites a decision of the Constitutional Chamber of May 2001, issued *after* the 2001 Regulation had become effective,869 which referred to a decision from 1993 that found that a provision of the draft Hydrocarbons Law was unconstitutional because it allowed the EIA to be approved after a concession had been granted.870 However, this is the only jurisprudential instance on record requiring an EIA to be approved prior to the granting of a concession before the issuance of the 2001 Regulation.871\n\nR-Rej.

CER-Araya 1, \u00b6 101 and fn. 79.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that, according to Article 17 of the Organic Law on the Environment, enacted in 1995, \u201c[t]he prior approval [of an EIA] by [the SETENA] shall be an indispensable requirement to ***initiate activities, works or projects\u201d*** \u201cthat alter or destroy elements of the environment or generate residues, toxic or dangerous materials.\u201d872 The TCA also invoked this provision in 2010 to argue that Article 34 ch) of the Mining Code had been tacitly abrogated.873 However, the Organic Law on the Environment does not require the approval of an EIA prior to the granting of the concession; it requires approval of an EIA prior to the commencement of activities. Article 34 ch) of the Mining Code is thus not inconsistent with the Organic Law on the Environment. Importantly, the 2002 Concession complied with both provisions, as it specified that \u201c[t]he concession holder, ***prior to commencing the exploitation activities****,* shall obtain the approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment, duly approved by the [SETENA]. Six months shall be granted for its submission to the [DGM].\u201d874\n\nR-Rej.

The Tribunal is thus not concerned with the reasoning in this Decision. What matters for present purposes is that the Constitutional Chamber annulled the 2002 Concession because it was flawed. There is no evidence on record that this flaw was induced by any misconduct on the part of the Claimant. Accordingly, it can only be attributed to the State, specifically to the MINAE, which issued the Concession.\n\n533.\n\nThis is consistent with the Costa Rican administrative law principle of *impulso de oficio,* pursuant to which the Administration has the duty to \u201cencourage or promote the procedure *ex officio,* even without requiring a gesture from a party, in order to make the procedure as expeditious and effective as possible, that is, to process without undue delay for its interveners.\u201d875 The Claimant\u2019s expert, Dr. Araya explains this principle as follows (an explanation with which Dr. Le\u00f3n concurs876):\n\n[P]ublic agencies have the obligation to \u2018push' the process forward to its final phase. That is why, in response to requests from individuals, agencies must review them, verify their requirements and, if they do not comply, ***it is their duty*** to request clarification or modification of submitted matters or request the presentation of information that is missing. Once the presentation of all the requirements has been verified, if approved, the process must move on to the next stage, and so on, until the final decision is reached.877\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 215, quoting Contentious Administrative Tribunal, Resolution No. 00095-2017 (31 July 2017), Section VI, Exh. **R-0300**.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 216.\n\nCER-Araya 1, \u00b6 12 (emphasis in original).\n\n534.\n\nDr. Araya concludes that (i) \u201cit is illogical to attribute to a private entity (and not to the State) the responsibility for directing an administrative process, determining the applicable legal instruments, interpreting the regulations, detecting formal or technical omissions, taking into account specific prohibitions of the matter or making clarifications in cases of lack of certainty\u201d,878 and (ii) \u201cit is the State (and not the private entity) that is responsible for the advancement and direction of the administrative procedures, and it makes its own decisions, which must always be motivated and in accordance with the principle of legality.\u201d879 Dr. Le\u00f3n agrees with both statements, but clarifies that \u201cthis principle does not assure compliance with the legality principle, nor does it exclude the jurisdictional control over the conduct (either active or passive).\u201d880 Be that as it may, it remains that it is the Government\u2019s duty to determine the necessary requirements for an administrative procedure, and to inform the petitioner of the action which it needs to take for that procedure to be successful.\n\nCER-Araya 1, \u00b6 17.\n\nCER-Araya 1, \u00b6 20.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 220.\n\n535.\n\nAs a consequence, it is clear that the legal defect of the 2002 Concession can only be attributed to the State. It was the State\u2019s duty to direct the process whereby Industrias Infinito would obtain its exploitation concession, and to determine the sequencing of the various approvals. Given the clear terms of Article 34 of the Mining Code, Transitory Article I of the 2001 Regulation and Article 17 of the Organic Law on the Environment, the lack of a firmly established jurisprudence to the contrary, and the *impulso de oficio* principle, one cannot reasonably blame the Claimant for not having realized that the black letter law laid down in the Mining Code, the 2001 Regulation (transitory provisions) and the Organic Law on the Environment had been tacitly abrogated.\n\n536.\n\nBecause the 2002 Concession was declared null and void, the TCA and the Administrative Chamber finally held in 2011 that the 2002 Concession had been removed from the legal system, with the consequence that Industrias Infinito had no acquired rights that would protect it from the operation of the 2002 Moratorium. Notwithstanding, the Government continued to work with Industrias Infinito to move the Project forward. Industrias Infinito continued with the EIA process, which included a public hearing with the participation of over 1,000 persons and visits by the SETENA Plenary Commission.881 In August 2005, SETENA approved the EIA, and requested Industrias Infinito to present a sworn affidavit of environmental commitments, make a financial deposit to serve as an environmental guarantee, appoint an environmental regent, and submit to SETENA a book of records.882 In December 2005, once Industrias Infinito had submitted the environmental affidavit, SETENA confirmed the environmental viability of the Project.883 In response to changing market conditions, Industrias Infinito updated its feasibility study (carried out in compliance with Canadian securities law), and requested an amendment of its EIA, which SETENA approved on 4 February 2008.884 On 15 February 2008, Industrias Infinito presented a revised feasibility study to the DGM, which considered extracting more gold from the same amount of material, as a result of the rise in the price of gold.885\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 136.\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 138; Resolution No. 2237-2005-SETENA (30 August 2005), Exh. **C-0130.**\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 140; Resolution No. 3638-2005-SETENA (12 December 2005), Exh. **C-****0134**.\n\nMicon International Limited, Bankable Feasibility Study for the Crucitas Gold Project (July 2006), Exh. **C-0152**; CWS-Peschke 1, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 51; Industrias Infinito, Presentation to SETENA of Environmental Assessment of Project Modifications (3 December 2007), Exh. **C-0168**; Industrias Infinito S.A., Report on Environmental Evaluation of Proposed Changes to the Project (1 November 2007), Exh. **C-0524**; List of Studies Conducted, Exh. **C-0456**; Resolution No. 170-2008-SETENA (4 February 2008), Exh. **C-0170**.\n\nCWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 4, \u00b6 78; Technical-Economic Feasibility Study Update (15 February 2008), Exh. **C-0531**.\n\n537.\n\nThe record shows that these processes were lengthy and involved several presentations from Industrias Infinito, many meetings with Government officials, and extensive review by SETENA.

Had Industrias Infinito done so, it would have known that it had no vested rights, that the Project was subject to the 2002 Moratorium and therefore could not proceed.897\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 124-130.\n\n541.\n\nThe Tribunal sees the matter differently. Whether or not the 2002 Moratorium applied to the Crucitas Project was not clear. First, Industrias Infinito had been granted a Concession before the Moratorium entered into force; in principle its right to exploit the concession was grandfathered. Second, while the 2002 Concession was indisputably annulled by the Constitutional Chamber, given the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d statement, it was unclear whether that nullity was absolute or relative. Had the nullity been relative, the Concession could potentially have been be validated *(convalidada)* or remedied (*saneada*) with retroactive effect,898 which would have meant that Industrias Infinito\u2019s Concession would have been grandfathered, and the 2002 Moratorium would not have applied to it. Third, the Government continued to work with Industrias Infinito towards the approval of the EIA and restoration of the Concession. It is undisputed that no branch of the Government attempted to apply the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito prior to the 2010 TCA Decision. Fourth, Industrias Infinito tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain clarification from the Constitutional Chamber as to the status of its Concession, which shows diligence and good faith. Fifth, the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s cryptic 2004 Decision (annulling the Concession \u201cwithout prejudice to what the [EIA] may determine\u201d), coupled with its 2006 and 2010 Decisions refusing to opine on the nature of the nullity declared or the applicability of the 2002 Moratorium, add to the lack of transparency of the legal framework. In view of all of these elements, the Tribunal does not concur with the Respondent that the Claimant should have known that the 2002 Moratorium applied to it. Even if it suspected that it might, neither the administrative agencies nor the courts had confirmed such application at that stage.\n\nGeneral Law of Public Administration, Law No. 6227 (5 February 1978), Article 187, Exh. **C-0014** (\u201c1. The act rendered relatively null by defect in form, content or competence may be validated by a new one that mentions the defect and its correction. 2. The validation has retroactive effect to the date of the validated act.\u201d); Article 188(1) and (3) (\u201c1. When the defect in the relatively null act consists of the absence of a substantial formality, such as an obligatory authorization, a proposal or request by another body, or a petition or claim by the petitioner, these may take place after the act, accompanied by a declaration of conformity with all its terms. [...] 3. The remediation will produce a retroactive effect at the date of the remediated act.\u201d)\n\n542.\n\nIndeed, as anticipated above when discussing the assurances alleged by the Claimant, the actions of the Government between 2004 and 2008 show that it considered that the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to the Project. These actions are discussed in paragraph 516 *supra* to which the Tribunal refers. It is particularly clear from Minister Dobles\u2019s statements quoted at paragraph 516 (g) *supra* that the Government firmly believed that the Project complied with all statutory and regulatory requirements and was not subject to the 2002 Moratorium.\n\n543.\n\nThe Government thus moved forward with all the necessary authorizations and granted the 2008 Concession. It is not clear why the Government decided to \u201cconvert\u201d the Concession (which created a new concession rather than restoring the previous one),899 but there is no doubt that the Government\u2019s intention was for the Project to go ahead.\n\nThe DGM Memorandum recommending the conversion is silent as to the reasons for the choice of mechanism. Memorandum No. DGM-RNM-284-2008 from the Director of the DGM to the Coordinator of the MINAE\u2019s Legal Department (11 April 2008), Exh. **C-0174**.\n\n544.\n\nThis intention is confirmed by the fact that President Arias repealed the 2002 Moratorium by decree on 18 March 2008,900 *i.e.*, *before* the 2008 Concession was granted about a month later on 21 April 2008. However, under its Article 6, this decree would come into effect on the date of its publication, which occurred only on 4 June 2008. The reasons for this delay in publication are unclear. Be this as it may, the fact is that the Government issued the 2008 Concession when the 2002 Moratorium was still in effect. Once again, the exploitation rights granted to Industrias Infinito were vitiated by a legal flaw that can only be attributed to the Costa Rican Government.\n\nDecree No. 34492-MINAE (18 March 2008), Article 5, Exh. **C-0172** and Exh. **R-0034**.\n\n545.\n\nThe facts just discussed resemble a comedy of errors, with tragic consequences for the Claimant: the two exploitation concessions granted to Industrias Infinito were legally deficient and, as a result, Industrias Infinito was caught by the 2002 Moratorium. As unfortunate as this situation may be, the Tribunal cannot disregard the fact that all of the events described above happened prior to the cut-off date (6 February 2011). Any claims arising from the Government\u2019s conduct between 2001 and 2008 are thus time-barred.\n\n546.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to assessing whether the Costa Rican courts treated the Claimant unfairly and inequitably. Two decisions are relevant here: the 2010 TCA Decision, which declared the annulment of the 2008 Concession, and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which confirmed the TCA Decision. While the 2010 TCA Decision was issued prior to the cut-off date, it became irreversible on 30 November 2011, when it was confirmed by the Administrative Chamber. Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal has found that any claims arising from the annulment of the 2008 Concession are not time-barred.901\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 239,245-246, 258, 271.\n\n547.\n\nAs discussed in paragraphs 496-500 *supra*, in 2010 the TCA declared that the 2008 Concession was null and void on various grounds, including that it had been granted while the 2002 Moratorium was in force. The other grounds for annulment stated by the TCA were (i) the fact that Industrias Infinito interpreted the exploration permit as automatically granting an exploitation concession; (ii) the application of the doctrine of conversion to an act that had been annulled *ab initio* by a Costa Rican court six years earlier; (iii) the fact that Industrias Infinito had requested a modification of the declaration of environmental viability instead of filing a new EIA; and (iv) that Industrias Infinito omitted to inform the administration that it was planning to create a pond on a public road and that it attempted to circumvent the technical restrictions as to excavation.902 However, it was the fact that the 2008 Concession was granted while the 2002 Moratorium was in force, that the Administrative Chamber characterized in its 2011 Decision as the crux of the matter, upon which the validity of the Concession rested. On this basis, the Administrative Chamber addressed only the violation of the 2002 Moratorium and deemed it unnecessary to refer to the other deficiencies identified by the TCA.903\n\nContentious Administrative Tribunal, Decision (14 December 2010), Exh. **C-0239**, pp. 63-114 (Spanish), pp. 63-114 (English).\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 285-286; Supreme Court (Administrative Chamber), Decision (30 November 2011), Whereas LIII, p. 243 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 79 (English), Whereas LX, p. 257 (PDF) (Spanish), p. 86 (English), Exh. **C-0261**.\n\n548.\n\nAs discussed in paragraph 501 *supra*, the Administrative Chamber found that, as a result of the annulment of the 2002 Concession by the Constitutional Chamber in 2004, Industrias Infinito had no vested right to exploit the Crucitas mine following the annulment of the 2002 Concession. Hence, the 2002 Moratorium precluded the Government from continuing the permitting process with Industrias Infinito, and the 2008 Concession (which was granted while the 2002 Moratorium was still in force) was null and void.\n\n549.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot find fault with these conclusions. As noted when discussing the Claimant\u2019s denial of justice claim, this decision was premised on Costa Rican law and reasoned. It cannot be characterized as arbitrary or capricious. As explained in *EDF* and *Lemire,* a measure is arbitrary when (i) it \u201cinflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;\u201d (ii) it \u201cis not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;\u201d (iii) it is \u201ctaken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;\u201d or (iv) it is \u201ctaken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.\u201d904 As summed up in *Lemire,* \u201cthe underlying notion of arbitrariness is that prejudice, preference or bias is substituted for the rule of law.\u201d905 That was clearly not the case here.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009 (\u201c***EDF (Services)***\u201d), \u00b6 303, Exh. **RL-0016**; *Lemire,* \u00b6 262, Exh. **CL-0051.**\n\n*Lemire,* \u00b6 263, Exh. **CL-0051**.\n\n550.\n\nThe Claimant nonetheless argues that the application of the 2002 Moratorium to the Crucitas Project in 2010-2011 served no rational purpose because by then the 2002 Moratorium had been repealed. However, when dealing with court decisions that is not the proper test. The question is whether the court decided on the basis of the law that was applicable to the facts before it. When the 2008 Concession was granted, it is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium was in force. The fact that it was later repealed should have no effect on the court\u2019s reasoning.\n\n551.\n\nNor can the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision be faulted for being inconsistent with the Government\u2019s prior conduct. While a government\u2019s conduct might qualify as inconsistent for purposes of FET if the same agency (or two agencies in the same sphere of competence) issue contradictory decisions that cause harm to an investor, this is not the case \u201cwhen the second agency, applying substantive legal criteria established in a pre-existing legal framework, takes a decision which diverges from that previously adopted by another agency.\u201d906 As the Respondent has rightly pointed out, this is not inconsistent conduct; it is the operation of the rule of law. Here, the Tribunal has found that the Administrative Chamber Decision complied with Costa Rican law.\n\n*Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6, Award, 27 August 2019, \u00b6 1420.\n\n552.\n\nFor these reasons, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Administrative Chamber's decision to annul the 2008 Concession cannot be deemed a breach of Costa Rica\u2019s obligation to accord FET to the Claimant\u2019s investments.907\n\nArbitrator Stern does not disagree with the substantive statement, but considers that such a statement is barred for two cumulative procedural reasons, one being that a court decision cannot be reviewed under the standard of FET, the other being that the act which has annulled the Concession was the 2010 TCA Decision, not the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision.\n\n*b. Did the Respondent Prevent the Claimant from Applying for a New Concession in Breach of the FET Standard?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that, through the combination of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Respondent prevented it from reinitiating the concession process in breach of FET.\n\n554.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case in this respect is essentially that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision only annulled the 2008 Concession and some related administrative acts, but not the administrative process (the *\u201ctr\u00e1mite\u201d)* itself. In the Claimant\u2019s submission, under the Mining Code before the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was passed, upon the revocation of the 2008 Concession, Industrias Infinito would have reverted to the status it would have had before the grant of the Concession, *i.e.*, that of an exploration permit holder who had applied for an exploitation concession.908 In this capacity, it would have been able to reinitiate the process and request a new concession. However, this was made impossible by the combined effect of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which prohibited the grant of new exploitation concessions in perpetuity and ordered the cancellation of all pending proceedings, and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, which cancelled not only the Concession, but also all of Industrias Infinito\u2019s pre-existing mining rights (presumably to implement the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, as the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not order the cancellation of Industrias Infinito\u2019s pre-existing mining rights).\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 601. *See also* CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6\u00b6 230-231, 235-236.\n\n555.\n\nAs a result, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban \u201cbreached Infinito\u2019s expectation that it could proceed with the Project in accordance with the Mining Code, and arbitrarily changed \u2018the rules of the game\u2019 and the legal framework applicable to Infinito.\u201d909 It also contends that the application of this Ban to the Crucitas Project served no rational purpose, as the Constitutional Chamber had confirmed that the Project was environmentally viable.910 Not only was there \u201cno proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized,\u201d but Infinito bears an excessive burden - indeed, the only burden, as Industrias Infinito was the only company affected by the Ban.911\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 599.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 604.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 604.\n\n556.\n\nAs to the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Claimant argues, first, that the Government could have chosen to take a different course of action following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, and second, that the Government exceeded its powers as the Resolution went beyond what the Administrative Chamber had ordered. Not only did the 2012 MINAET Resolution cancel the 2008 Concession; it also archived the file and declared the Crucitas area free of any mining right, thus preventing Industrias Infinito from continuing with the administrative process it had already started with its exploration permit. The Claimant speculates that this cancellation might have been premised on the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which ordered all pending proceedings to be cancelled and archived.912 The Claimant\u2019s FET claim against the 2012 MINAET Resolution is thus tied to its claim against the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which the 2012 MINAET Resolution allegedly implemented (and indeed, the Claimant repeatedly characterizes the \u201cinteraction\u201d between these two measures as the source of the alleged breach of FET).913\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 600.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, C-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 601, 604.\n\n557.\n\nThe 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was a statute that amended several provisions of the Mining Code. In particular, it amended Article 8 of the Mining Code as follows:914\n\nMining exploitation in areas declared national parks, biological reserves, forest reserves and state refuges of wildlife is prohibited.\n\n[...]\n\nAll the areas of The Abangares Canton, Osa and Golfito, with potential for metal mining, are declared mining reserve zones and are frozen in favour of the State, based on the technical studies carried out by the Directorate of Geology and Mines of the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications (Minaet).\n\nThis reserve includes all the areas which are free of exploitation concessions and all of those which, in the future, may acquire such condition, whether it is by the expiration, cancellation or any other form of expiration of the previously granted rights.\n\nIn the mining reserve area established in this article, only exploration permits, mining exploitation concessions and [benefit of] material[s] may be granted to properly organized workers in cooperatives dedicated to mining in a small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use (coligallero), according to the terms established in this Law and its Regulations.\n\nThe granting of these permits and concessions shall be given, exclusively, to cooperatives of workers for the development of mining in a small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use (coligallero) from communities surrounding the exploitation sites, based on the amount of affiliates of such cooperatives. The affiliated workers cannot belong, at the time, to more than one small scale mining cooperative.\n\nSmall scale mining for the subsistence of families is understood as the underground extraction carried out through manual and mechanic collective work, where the extraction volume is established by the Directorate of Geology and Mines according to the technical-geological studies submitted in the concession request, taking into consideration the use of modern exploitation techniques to maximize the metal extraction and the environmental protection in line with sustainable development. For determining the volume to be under concession, the Directorate of Geology and Mines shall apply equity and proportionality criteria according to the number of affiliated workers and the concession requests.\n\nFor this purpose, the Executive Branch shall recover through the relevant authority, in accordance with the due process, the concessions which are in no use or exploited in an irregular manner. No concession shall be renovated or extended if it fails to comply with the provisions of this article.\n\nThe Directorate of Geology and Mines is authorized to grant exploration permits and mining concessions for mining in small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and coligallero.\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 1 (amending Article 8 of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\n558.\n\nThe 2011 Legislative Mining Ban also amended Article 8 bis of the Mining Code in the following terms:915\n\nPermits or concessions shall not be granted for the exploration and exploitation activities of open-pit mining of metallic minerals on national territory. It is established as an exception that only exploration permits for scientific and investigatory purposes shall be granted.\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 2 (amending Article 8 bis of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\n559.\n\nThe Ban contained a grandfathering provision, according to which \u201cconcession rights acquired in good faith and in compliance with all requirements of the current legislation, prior to its entry into force are excluded from the provisions of this Law.\u201d916 However, it also stated that \u201c[a]ll [proceedings] related to exploration permits and [exploitation] concessions to engage in open-pit metal mining activities, which are pending in the Directorate of Geology and Mines and the National Technical Environmental Secretariat at the date of entry into force of the present Law, shall be archived.\u201d917\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Transitory Provision II, Exh. **C-0238.**\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Transitory Provision III, Exh. **C-0238**.\n\n560.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that, in the abstract, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was unfair and inequitable. More specifically, it is not convinced that the Ban lacked a rational purpose and is therefore arbitrary. While it is not clear from the Ban itself that its purpose was to protect the environment (there is no preamble or message explaining its reasons), certain provisions in the Ban suggest that the protection of the environment may have been at least part of the purpose behind is enactment.918 The Tribunal also notes that small-scale miners (organized workers in cooperatives dedicated to mining in a small scale for the subsistence of families, artisanal mining and prospector use (coligallero)) were excluded from the Ban.919 They were also allowed to use cyanide and mercury leaching techniques for eight years following the entry into force of the Ban, which does not quite conform to the objective of protecting the environment. However, the Tribunal accepts that Costa Rica may have had other reasons *(e.g,* social or economic reasons) to exclude small-scale mining from the Ban.\n\nFor instance, Article 4 amended Article 103 of the Mining Code to add that \u201c[t]he use of cyanide and mercury leaching techniques in mining and the improper use of dangerous substances in accordance with the provisions of The World Health Organization\u201d \u201cshall be considered factors that deteriorate the environment.\u201d Amendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 4 (amending Article 103 of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238.**\n\nAmendment to Mining Code, No. 8904 (1 December 2010), Article 1 (amending Article 8 of the Mining Code), Exh. **C-0238**.\n\n561.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal is of the view that the *application* of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban to the Claimant was unfair and inequitable. While as discussed above the Claimant could have no legitimate expectation of legal stability, the Tribunal finds that the application of the Ban to the Crucitas Project was disproportionate to the public policy pursued.\n\n562.\n\nAs noted in *AES*, for a measure to be reasonable, \u201cthere needs to be an appropriate correlation between the state\u2019s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it,\u201d and \u201c[t]his has to do with the nature of the measure and the way it is implemented.\u201d920 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the measure must also be proportionate to its purpose. The Claimant has alleged (and the Respondent has not contested) that, at the time of its enactment, the only project caught by its provisions was the Crucitas Project. However, at that point in time, the Constitutional Chamber had already ruled that the Project was environmentally sound. There was thus no reasonable correlation between the aim sought by the measure and its effect on the Claimant.\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erom\u00fc Kft v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010 (\u201c***AES***\u201d), \u00b6 10.3.9, Exh. **CL-0260**.\n\n563.\n\nTo be reasonable and proportionate vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimant (while still capturing future projects that were untested), Parliament could have included a grandfathering provision that protected the Crucitas Project, or could have allowed pending proceedings to continue.\n\n564.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on the Claimant, because as a result of the 2010 Executive Moratoria, Industrias Infinito was in any event precluded from applying for a new concession. For the Tribunal, this argument relates to causation (and is addressed further below). In terms of its content and scope, the Tribunal finds that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban definitively forbade open pit-mining for an indefinite period, thus depriving the Claimant of any real opportunity to reinitiate the Crucitas Project. By contrast, the 2010 Executive Moratoria did not prohibit open-pit mining outright; they merely established a suspension of such activities. Nor did they order all pending proceedings to be archived. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Dr. Le\u00f3n\u2019s explanation that archiving a file is a physical process and does not mean that the rights do not exist.921 It is clear from the Ban that the intention was to terminate all pending proceedings.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 136 (\u201cSubsequently, it was ordered to be archived. This decision did not change the company\u2019s status since it only meant that the file was physically sent to a different place called the archive. A decision to \u2018archive\u2019 is not a synonym for nullity or non-existence in relation to what should have happened at that time.\u201d)\n\n565.\n\nThe effect of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban on the Claimant was that, once the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision confirmed the annulment of the Concession, it was no longer allowed to request a new mining concession. Had the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban not ordered the cancellation of pending proceedings, and had the 2012 MINAET Resolution not acted upon it, following the annulment of the 2008 Concession, Industrias Infinito would have returned to the position it was in before the grant of the concession, *i.e.*, an exploration permit holder with a pending application for an exploitation concession. To reach this conclusion, the Tribunal has taken the following elements into account:\n\n566.\n\nFirst, the Claimant relies on the expert evidence of Messrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and Rojas,922 and of Dr. Araya.923 While Dr. Araya\u2019s reliability was called into question at the hearing, her evidence is grounded on the clear terms of Article 171 of the General Law of Public Administration, which provides that \u201c[t]he declaration of absolute nullity shall have a purely declaratory and retroactive effect to the date of the act, all without prejudice to the rights acquired in good faith.\u201d924\n\nCER-Hern\u00e1ndez-Rojas 1, \u00b6\u00b6 322-323; 327.\n\nCER-Araya 1, \u00b6 56.\n\nGeneral Law of Public Administration, Law No. 6227 (5 February 1978), Exh. **C-0014**, Article 171.\n\n567.\n\nSecond, the Respondent has not specifically addressed the Claimant\u2019s argument that the annulment of a concession does not cancel the underlying proceedings and previously acquired administrative rights. The Respondent has argued that an exploration permit does not automatically grant the right to an exploitation concession,925 but that is not the point here. It has also submitted that, because Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploration permit expired in September 1999, it could not have applied for a new exploitation concession even absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6\u00b6 31-42.\n\n568.\n\nIt is true that Article 26 of the Mining Code provides that \u201c[d]uring the term of an exploration permit and up to sixty days after the expiration of the term or its extension, the [exploration permit] holder shall be entitled to obtain an exploitation concession, provided that [it] ha[s] fulfilled [its] obligations and the requirements of this Law and its regulations.\u201d926 However, this provision must be interpreted as requiring an exploration permit holder to *apply* for an exploitation concession within that period. To interpret it as requiring an exploitation concession to be granted within those 60 days would not conform with reality, as the permitting process may take several years, as the case at hand proves. Indeed, Dr. Le\u00f3n confirms that this interpretation is correct.927\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 26, Exh. **C-0015**.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6 308 (\u201cInfinito\u2019s witness Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez affirmed that the term of the exploration permit expired on 18 September 1999. In strict interpretation of Article 26 of the Mining Code, Infinito had two moments to submit the mining concession application: (i) during the period of validity of the exploration permit (7 June 1993 to 18 September 1999), or (ii) sixty days after the indicated expiration.\u201d)\n\n569.\n\nIt appears undisputed that Industrias Infinito applied for an exploitation concession in a timely manner, *i.e.*, within 60 days following the expiry of the exploration permit.928 If, prior to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, Industrias Infinito could have retained its rights in *tr\u00e1mite* (as acquired administrative rights), it seems irrelevant if the exploration permit had already expired.\n\nIndustrias Infinito S.A., Request for Exploitation Concession (18 December 1999), Exh. **C-0053.** The term of the exploration permit had been extended to 18 September 1999. Resolution No. 193-DGM (2 April 1998), Exh. **C-0046**.\n\n570.\n\nThird, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s argument that, pursuant to Article 63 of the Mining Code, the cancellation of all mining rights is the natural consequence of the concession\u2019s annulment. While it is true that Article 63 provides that, once a concession is cancelled, the DGM \u201cshall issue the corresponding cancellation resolution,\u201d and once this resolution is firm, \u201cthe zone shall be liberated from the respective mining rights,\u201d929 Article 63 refers to cases of cancellation due to *caducidad, i.e.,* cases in which the concession holder has failed to comply with the conditions set out in the concession or in the law.930 It does not refer to cases of annulment caused by legal flaws attributable to the granting authority when the concession holder is in good faith.\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 63, Exh. **C-0015**; RER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6 303.\n\nMining Code, Law No. 6797 (4 October 1982), Article 63, Exh. **C-0015** (\u201cThe exploitation concession may be cancelled if the holder does not comply with the conditions specified in the resolution granting it, in accordance with this Law and its regulations, especially in the following cases [...]\u201d).\n\n571.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, in light of Article 171 of the General Law of Public Administration, the right of an exploration permit holder to apply for an exploitation concession must survive the annulment of a concession granted unlawfully when the concession holder is in good faith. Importantly, Dr. Le\u00f3n appears to acknowledge that the process initiated by Industrias Infinito in 1999 to obtain an exploitation concession was still pending (\u201c*en tr\u00e1mite\u201d)* as a result of the annulment of the concession(s):931\n\nIn Industrias Infinito\u2019s case, the Mining Registry was cancelled by judicial order, as a consequence of the absolute nullity of Concession 578-2001 and, by default, nullity of Concession 217 - 2008. That very nullity caused the company to have a case in process and a procedure that was suspended due to the indicated moratorium.\n\nRER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 136.\n\n572.\n\nThese considerations suggest that, but for the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, Industrias Infinito would have been restored to the position of an exploration permit holder with a pending application for an exploitation concession. While the 2010 Executive Moratoria would not have allowed Industrias Infinito to request a new exploitation concession then, this Moratorium was not an outright prohibition, and Industrias Infinito could have retained its rights in *tr\u00e1mite* until those Moratoria were repealed.\n\n573.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the application of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban to the Claimant was unfair and inequitable.\n\n574.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the 2012 MINAET Resolution amounted to a breach of FET. It is true that the 2012 MINAET Resolution declared the Crucitas Project free of all mining rights,932 when neither the TCA nor the Administrative Chamber expressly so provided. However, this declaration logically flowed from the annulment of the 2008 Concession and more particularly from the order in the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban that all pending proceedings be archived. The Tribunal sees the 2012 MINAET Resolution as an ancillary action taken in the implementation of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. As such, it cannot be assessed as an independent breach of FET, but shares the fate of these actions. Accordingly, to the extent that it applied the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAET Decision does not amount to a breach of FET. However, to the extent that it applied the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, it forms part of that FET breach.\n\nResolution No. 0037, MINAET, File No. 2594 (9 January 2012), Exh. **C-0268**. In addition to cancelling the 2008 Concession, this resolution ordered the \u201cAdministrative file 2594 [to be] archived,\u201d and \u201cthe area [to be] liberated from the Mining Registry.\u201d\n\n575.\n\nAs to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s inaction following the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was a policy choice, the Tribunal is of the view that the Government could not have acted differently once the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban was in place. The Government cannot issue permits that violate domestic law. The breach of FET occurred with the Ban itself; not with the Government\u2019s subsequent conduct.\n\n*c. Does the Respondent Continue to Treat the Claimant in an Unfair Manner?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that, by reinitiating the TCA Damages proceeding, the Respondent continues to treat Infinito unfairly and inequitably.\n\n577.\n\nThe 2010 TCA Decision ordered Industrias Infinito, the Government and SINAC to bear the costs of restoring the Crucitas site to its pre-project condition. Through the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the TCA ordered Industrias Infinito, the SINAC and the State to pay USD 6.4 million for environmental damages within six months. In December 2017, the Administrative Chamber overturned the 2015 TCA Damages Decision for lack of motivation and remanded the file to the TCA. More specifically, the Administrative Chamber held that the TCA did not assess the experts\u2019 report on environmental damages, did not make any reference to the parties\u2019 positions and did not justify the rate which it applied to determine the amount of the damages. This proceeding sat inactive until January 2019, when the TCA reinitiated it.933\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 114-118.\n\n578.\n\nThe Claimant contends that \u201c[t]he continuation of this proceeding continues Costa Rica\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable standard, and any damages and costs (including defence costs) associated with this proceeding are further damages to Infinito resulting from that breach.\u201d934\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 613. Consequently, Infinito requests \u201ca declaration that Costa Rica is liable to indemnify Infinito for any amounts Infinito or [Industrias Infinito] are required to pay as a result of, or in connection with, this late-blooming proceeding.\u201d *Ibid.*\n\n579.\n\nIn contrast to the four other measures challenged by Infinito, this measure does not relate to the loss of the Concession or Industrias Infinito\u2019s inability to pursue a new one; it relates to damages that Industrias Infinito might be required to pay as a result of its use of the site, which damages Infinito deems arbitrary. As discussed in Section V.D.3.b(vi) *supra,* the Tribunal considers that this claim pertains to a distinct FET violation.\n\n580.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this claim is premature. The TCA has not issued any decision quantifying the damages to be paid by Industrias Infinito. However, it cannot be said that the claim is manifestly without legal merit, as the Respondent also contends. It is undisputed that the 2010 TCA Decision ordered Industrias Infinito to bear part of the costs of restoring the site, and this decision was confirmed by the Administrative Chamber. What remains to be decided is the amount that Industrias Infinito will need to pay. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the claim is premature and thus inadmissible at this stage, but will not declare that it lacks merit.\n\n**3. Conclusion on FET and Impact on Quantum**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nIn conclusion, a majority of the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has breached its FET obligation through the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and, as an ancillary act, the 2012 MINAET Resolution (to the extent that it implemented that Ban). The effect of these measures was to deprive Industrias Infinito of the opportunity to apply for a new exploitation concession.\n\n582.\n\nAlthough it considers the breach established, the Tribunal has difficulty identifying the damage which the breach may have caused. Had it not been for the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision Industrias Infinito would have been restored to the position of an exploration permit holder with a pending application for an exploitation concession. However, at that time, the 2010 Executive Moratoria, which were still in place, would have barred Industrias Infinito from obtaining a new exploitation concession.\n\n583.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, despite this, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had a \u201cclear impact\u201d on the Crucitas Project.935 The argument is essentially that (i) it was the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and not the Administrative Chamber Decision which mandated the cancellation of its remaining mining rights, and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratoria \u201cwould not have deprived [Industrias Infinito] of its underlying rights, which [Industrias Infinito] could have built on to seek restoration of its key permits, once lifted.\u201d936\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 737.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 737.\n\n584.\n\nWhile these considerations may well be correct, they do not suggest that the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban caused a quantifiable harm. The fact remains that, regardless of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, Industrias Infinito was precluded from applying for an exploitation concession because of the 2010 Executive Moratoria. While these Moratoria did not establish a permanent mining ban, there is no indication in the record as to when Industrias Infinito would have been able to reapply for an exploitation concession. It should also be noted in this context that the 2010 Executive Moratoria were issued prior to the cut-off date and that therefore any claim related to them is time-barred.\n\n585.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to accept that the fact of harm was established, this would not assist the Claimant\u2019s case. There is no basis in the record, and Infinito has articulated none, allowing the Tribunal to quantify the damage caused by this standalone breach. Pursuant to the full reparation standard stated in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, \u201c[r]eparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\u201d937 Here, absent the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, Industrias Infinito would have been in the situation of an exploration permit holder. Assuming *arguendo* that the 2010 Executive Moratoria did not already prevent Industrias Infinito from restarting the process, the Claimant\u2019s harm would essentially consist in the loss of an opportunity or chance to apply for an exploitation concession. Yet, the Claimant has not put forward a quantification for such a loss of opportunity, nor has it provided the Tribunal with any elements to calculate it. If one adds the inherent uncertainty and the regulatory risk involved in any application process, the monetary consequences of this loss of chance appear too speculative to give rise to an award of damages.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland), 1928 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 17 (13 September 1928), \u00b6 125, Exh. **CL-0024**.\n\n586.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it cannot award damages for the FET breach stemming from the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, alone or in conjunction with the 2012 MINAET Resolution.\n\n**D. F****ull Protection and Security**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, contrary to Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, Costa Rica failed to grant Infinito\u2019s investments FPS.\n\n**a. The FPS Standard Under Article II(2)(b)**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Claimant makes four submissions with respect to the scope of the FPS standard enshrined at Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n589.\n\nFirst, it argues that the FPS standard covers the physical as well as the legal security of its investments.938 The wording of the BIT does not limit the obligation to physical security and, in the absence of such language, the standard should be interpreted to include legal security.939 Relying on *Biwater Gauff,* the Claimant submits that \u201cwhen the terms \u2018protection\u2019 and \u2018security\u2019 are qualified by \u2018full\u2019, the content of the standard may extend to matters other than physical security.\u201d940 This is supported by the definition of \u201cInvestment\u201d in the BIT, which is broad and includes both tangible and intangible assets.941\n\nC-Mem.

United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008 (\u201c***Biwater Gauff***\")*,* \u00b6 729, Exh. **CL-0021**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 635.\n\n590.\n\nSecond, the Claimant asserts that the FPS standard is independent from the FET standard.942 These standards are contained in two different provisions, which means that the \u201cdrafters intended for these standards to independently provide protection.\u201d943 The Claimant further contends that \u201cit would significantly undermine the protections of the BIT to declare a decisive rule that the [FPS] standard imposes nothing separate or independent from Article II(2)(a).\u201d944\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 638.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 638-639, citing *Jan de Nul N. V. and Dredging International N. V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 June 2006 (\u201c***Jan de Nul*** **Jurisdiction**\u201d), \u00b6 269, Exh. **CL-0204**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 639.\n\n591.\n\nThird, the Claimant acknowledges that the FPS standard does not impose strict or absolute liability on the Respondent, but requires it to act with due diligence to protect its investments by adopting all possible measures that could be reasonably expected. It thus requires active conduct on the part of the State, not the mere abstention from prejudicial conduct.945\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 642-643.\n\n592.\n\nFourth, the Claimant contends that the FPS standard protects investors from injuries, irrespective of whether they were caused by the host State actors or a third party.946 The Claimant further contends that \u201c[d]enying the application of the full protection and security clause against the state\u2019s own actions would deprive the application of the clause to legal security of any meaning.\u201d947\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 640; *American Manufacturing & Trading v.

The Respondent Breached Its Obligation to Provide Full Protection and Security**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to provide legal security to Infinito\u2019s investments and that its behavior falls below the standard of due diligence. Specifically, Costa Rica failed to create a legal system protecting Industrias Infinito\u2019s mining rights and providing a process to uphold those rights.948\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 644.\n\n594.\n\nFor the Claimant, the following actions by the Respondent show that it did not grant legal security for the Claimant\u2019s investments: (i) the Administrative Chamber annulled the 2008 Concession on the basis of the 2002 Moratorium even though it did not apply to the Crucitas Project; (ii) the Minister of the Environment then formally cancelled the 2008 Concession and extinguished Industrias Infinito\u2019s pre-existing mining rights; (iii) the Respondent did not put in place a legal system to prevent the issuance of inconsistent decisions by its courts.949\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 347.\n\n595.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s contentions, making the judicial system available to the investor and ensuring that decisions are taken in good faith is insufficient; the FPS standard includes ensuring the stability of the legal system as a whole. By \u201cmaintaining a legal system that allows for contradictory decisions to co-exist without a mechanism to address this inconsistency,\u201d the Respondent failed to do so, and it did not make its judicial system available to the Claimant in a meaningful way.950\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 645.\n\n596.\n\nInfinito further argues that the FPS obligation binds not only Costa Rica\u2019s judicial organs and executive branch, which \u201chad a duty not only to refrain from acting negligently, as it did, but to take actions to correct unacceptable behavior.\u201d951 Here, the Government committed errors in granting Industrias Infinito\u2019s permits and approvals and failed to adopt a mechanism to address the conflicting decisions issued by the Supreme Court, or to rectify the situation created by the annulment of the Concession and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban.952\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 647.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 647.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**a. The FPS Standard**\n-----------------------\n\n597.\n\nThe Respondent argues that (i) the FPS standard under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT is limited to physical security; (ii) the definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d does not expand the scope of the FPS standard; (iii) the FPS standard does not provide protection in addition to the FET obligation; and (iv) the correct legal standard of the FPS obligation only requires due diligence and good faith.953\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 676-693.\n\n598.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the FPS standard does not compel a host State to ensure the legal security of investors\u2019 assets. Relying on *Saluka* and *Rumeli,* the Respondent argues that the FPS clause is not meant to cover any kind of impairment of an investor\u2019s investment, but only to protect the physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of force.954 The fact that this is not expressly stated in the BIT does not mean that the FPS standard extends to legal security.955 Citing *Parkerings,* the Respondent denies that the reference to \u201cfull\u201d protection and security makes a difference in the level of protection a State is required to provide.956\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 478, citing *Saluka,* \u00b6\u00b6 483-484, Exh. **CL-0077**; *Rumeli,* \u00b6 668, Exh. **CL-0075**.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 676.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 677, citing *Parkerings,* \u00b6 354, Exh. **CL-0068**.\n\n599.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT is at odds with the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention. As Canada has emphasized in its Non-Disputing Party Submission, the scope of the FPS standard of the BIT is limited to physical protection and security of qualifying investments.957 This interpretation is consistent with the rules on treaty interpretation provided in the VCLT, as it conforms to the ordinary meaning of \u201cfull protection and security\u201d in its context and in light of the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose. It is also supported by Canada\u2019s treaty practice, as in recent treaties \u201cCanada has taken steps to clarify that the [FPS] obligation \u2018has always been intended to refer to physical protection and security\u2019 - for example through a joint interpretive statement.\u201d958\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 678, citing Canada\u2019s Non-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 40-47.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 679.\n\n600.\n\nSecond, the Respondent denies that the definition of \u201cinvestment\u201d widens the scope of the FPS standard because it includes both tangible and intangible assets.959 Many arbitral awards involving treaties with similarly broad definitions of \u201cinvestment\u201d have held that the FPS standard is limited to physical protection.960 As noted by the *AWG Group* tribunal, the cases cited by the Claimant (such as *CME*961 and *Azurix*962) have not provided any reason to depart from the historical interpretation of the standard.963\n\nR-Rej.

The Respondent Did Not Breach Its FPS Obligation**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it did not breach Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, as neither the challenged judicial measures nor the actions of the executive branch have failed to provide FPS to the Claimant\u2019s investments.\n\n***(i) The Judicial Measures Challenged by the Claimant Did Not Amount to a Breach of Costa Rica's Full FPS Obligation***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the judicial measures of which the Claimant complains (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the alleged lack of a mechanism to address inconsistencies between the decisions of the Supreme Court) amount to a breach of FPS.\n\n605.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that Costa Rica could not have breached the FPS standard since there is no allegation of physical harm.973\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 492; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 697.\n\n606.\n\nSecond, assuming that the FPS standard extends to legal security and protection, *quod non,* Infinito has established no denial of justice.974\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 698.\n\n607.\n\nThird, under the same assumption, the Respondent complied with the due diligence imposed by the FPS standard, which only requires \u201cCosta Rica\u2019s judicial system [to be] available to the Claimant and [...] the decisions of the Costa Rican judiciary [to be] taken in good faith and tenable.\u201d975 The issuance by a domestic court of a judgment adverse to the investor does not establish a breach of the FPS obligation.976 According to the Respondent, the Costa Rican courts rendered their decisions \u201cin good faith, impartially and with due respect for Industrias Infinito\u2019s procedural rights\u201d and in accordance with Costa Rican law. More specifically, the Administrative Chamber provided Industrias Infinito with a full opportunity to present its case, including through written and oral pleadings.977 In the alternative, the Respondent contends that a mere error in the application of domestic law does not amount to a breach of the FPS standard.978\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 494; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 699-700.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 495; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 700.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 497; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 701.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 701.\n\n608.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that the Costa Rican courts assessed and rejected all of the Claimant\u2019s arguments relating to the *res judicata* principle and the co-existence of contradictory decisions within Costa Rica\u2019s judicial order.979 As discussed in the context of denial of justice, there is no inconsistency between the decisions of the Administrative and the Constitutional Chambers, because each Chamber has its own area of competence.980\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 702.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 496; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 702.\n\n609.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that \u201cit would not have been reasonable to expect Costa Rica to overhaul its entire legal system and introduce a new judicial mechanism simply to address these allegedly conflicting decisions.\u201d981 Its actions were reasonable: it ensured a fair process for all parties and provided for a judicial system in which each Chamber has its own area of jurisdiction, precisely in order to avoid contradictory decisions.982\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 704.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 703, 705.\n\n***(ii) The Actions of Costa Rica's Executive Branch Did Not Amount to a Breach of the FPS***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n610.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent repeats that the FPS standard could not have been breached since the Claimant does not point out to any physical harm.983 In any event, the Respondent disputes that Costa Rica\u2019s executive branch acted in a manner that could give rise to a breach of the FPS standard.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 708-709.\n\n611.\n\nFirst, the FPS standard only requires the host State to comply with a duty of due diligence.984\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 710.\n\n612.\n\nSecond, the Claimant\u2019s argument that Costa Rica\u2019s executive branch \u201cfailed to rectify the situation\u201d is too vague to establish a breach to the BIT. If the Claimant\u2019s argument is that the MINAET should have disregarded the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, it is misguided, as \u201c[s]uch action would not only be \u2018contrary to the legal system\u2019, but also likely result in criminal and disciplinary proceedings against MINAE[T] officials for failure to abide by an express legal mandate.\u201d985\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 711.\n\n613.\n\nThird, as to the Claimant\u2019s position that the executive branch failed to adopt a mechanism to address the inconsistencies in its legal system, the Respondent contends that the executive branch cannot \u201creform the judiciary at will and thereby alter the checks and balances under the Costa Rican Constitution.\u201d986\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 712.\n\n614.\n\nFourth, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal cannot take into account the executive errors in granting Industrias Infinito\u2019s permits and approvals since these facts fall outside its jurisdiction *ratione temporis.987*\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 713.\n\n615.\n\nFifth, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant that the 2012 MINAET Resolution extinguished its pre-existing mining rights without a valid basis. This is because the Claimant did not have such rights when the 2008 Concession was annulled, as Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploration permit had expired on 18 September 1999.988\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 501; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 714.\n\n616.\n\nSixth, the Respondent submits that the most the Claimant could reasonably have expected was for the executive branch to assist Industrias Infinito in defending the legality of the Concession before the Costa Rican courts, which it did.989\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 715.\n\n617.\n\nFinally, the Respondent stresses that any complaint with regard to the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban relates to the actions of Costa Rica\u2019s legislative branch. In any event, as discussed in the context of FET, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had not impact on the Claimant.990\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 716.\n\n**3. Canada\u2019s Position**\n------------------------\n\n618.\n\nIn its Non-Disputing Party Submission, Canada argues that Article II(2)(b) of the BIT does not extend beyond the physical protection and security of investments. Canada submits that this interpretation is in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, as the ordinary meaning of the words \u201cprotection\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d point to \u201ca general meaning of safety from physical harm, injury or impairment.\u201d991\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 41, citing the definitions of \u201cprotection;\u201d \u201cprotect;\u201d \u201charm;\u201d \u201cinjure;\u201d \u201csecurity;\u201d \u201cdanger;\u201d and \u201cthreat\u201d in the English Oxford Living Dictionaries, online: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/, Exh. **CAN-0018**.\n\n619.\n\nCanada further asserts that the FPS standard was historically developed in the context of physical protection and security of a company\u2019s officials, employees or facilities, and submits that the notions of \u201cprotection and constant security\u201d or \u201cfull protection and security\u201d in international law have traditionally been associated with situations where the physical security of the investor or its investment was compromised.992 Hence, when it is interpreted in light of its object and purpose, it is clear that the FPS standard is intended to provide physical protection and security for investments.\n\nCanada\u2019s Submission, \u00b6 42, citing *Enron* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 284-287, Exh. **CL-0036**; and *BG Group Pic. v.

The FPS Standard**\n-----------------------\n\n621.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the BIT provides as follows:997\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party shall accord investments of the other Contracting Party:\n\n[...]\n\n(b) full protection and security.\n\nBIT, Article II(2)(b), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n622.\n\nAccording to Costa Rica, \u201cfull protection and security\u201d refers only to physical security, while the Claimant attributes to this term a wider meaning including legal security.\n\n623.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s view is that, absent treaty language indicating that legal security is covered, the FPS standard is intended to ensure physical protection and integrity of the investor and its property within the territory of the host State. While the stability of the business environment and legal security are captured by the standard of fair and equitable treatment, the full protection and security standard primarily seeks to protect investment from physical harm done by third parties.998 As noted by the *Enron* tribunal, \u201cthere might be cases where a broader interpretation could be justified, but then it becomes difficult to distinguish such situation from one resulting in the breach of fair and equitable treatment, and even from some form of expropriation.\u201d999 This Tribunal concurs that an overly extensive interpretation of FPS standard may result in an overlap with the other standards of investment protection, which is neither necessary nor desirable.\n\n*AWG* Liability, \u00b6 173, Exh. **RL-0208**; *El Paso*, \u00b6\u00b6 522-523, Exh. **CL-0035**.\n\n*Enron* Award, \u00b6 286, Exh. **CL-0036**.\n\n624.\n\nWhile some awards, such as *CME,* adopted a broader interpretation of FPS covering also legal security and protection, a number of subsequent awards have maintained the more traditional approach to interpreting the notion of FPS. In *Saluka,* the tribunal noted that \u201c[t]he practice of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate [...] that the \u2018full security and protection\u2019 clause is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor's investment but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of force.\u201d1000 Similarly, the tribunal in *Parkerings* held that \u201c[i]t is generally accepted that the variation of language between the formulation \u2018protection\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 does not make a difference in the level of protection a State is to provide.\u201d1001 A similar rationale has been applied by arbitral tribunals in *BG, PSEG* and *Rumeli.*1002\n\n*Saluka, \u00b6* 484, Exh. **CL-0077**.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 677, citing *Parkerings,* \u00b6 354, Exh. **CL-0068**.\n\n*BG Group,* \u00b6\u00b6 323-328, Exh. **CAN-0009**; *PSEG,* \u00b6\u00b6 258-259, Exh. **CL-0073**; *Rumeli,* \u00b6 669, Exh. **CL-0075**.\n\n625.\n\nThe Parties further disagree as to whether the FPS standard forms part of FET standard, as submitted by the Respondent, or is a separate standard of protection, as argued by the Claimant. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the fact that the Costa Rica-Canada BIT addresses FET and FPS in two distinct subparagraphs of Article II(2) indicates that the Contracting Parties intended them to cover two different obligations. Thus, a contextual interpretation requires the Tribunal to give effect to that intention by giving the two concepts distinct meanings and fields of application, a position that is supported by the practice of investment tribunals.1003 For instance, as stated in *Jan de Nul,* \u201c[t]he notion of continuous protection and security is to be distinguished here from the fair and equitable treatment standard since they are placed in two different provisions of the BIT, even if the two guarantees overlap.\u201d1004\n\n*Jan de Nul* Award \u00b6 269, Exh. **RL-0091**; *Electrabel,* \u00b6 7.83, Exh. **RL-0126**; *Vannessa Ventures,* \u00b6\u00b6 221-224, Exh. **RL-0078**; *Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe S.A. v.

Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2008), pp. 149-150. *See also* *Lauder,* \u00b6 308, Exh. **RL-0229** (\u201c[T]he Treaty does not oblige the Parties to protect foreign investment against any possible loss of value caused by persons whose acts could not be attributed to the State.\u201d)\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.

That said, a mere lack of due diligence will suffice to breach international law; there is no need to establish malice or negligence.1011\n\n*AALP*, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 76-77; Exh. **CL-0121**.\n\n*AAPL*, \u00b6 77, Exh. **CL-0121**.\n\n*AAPL*, \u00b6 77, Exh. **CL-0121** (emphasis added).\n\n*Saluka,* \u00b6 484, Exh. **CL-0077** (the State was under an obligation to \u201cadopt all reasonable measures to protect assets and property from threats or attacks\u201d); *Tecmed,* \u00b6 177, Exh. **CL-0085**; *AES*, \u00b6 13.3.2; Exh. **CL-0260**.\n\n*AAPL*, \u00b6 77, Exh. **CL-0121**; *Lauder,* \u00b6 308, Exh. **RL-0229**.\n\n628.\n\nWith these specifications in mind, the Tribunal will now determine whether the Respondent breached Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n**b. Has the Respondent Breached the FPS Standard?**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s FPS claim is premised on an alleged failure by Costa Rica to provide legal security to the Claimant\u2019s investments; the Claimant has not pointed to any physical harm. As the Tribunal has found that the BIT\u2019s FPS standard only protects against physical harm, the Claimant\u2019s claim must fail.\n\n**E. E****xpropriation**\n------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article VIII of the BIT covers both direct and indirect expropriation and that judicial measures can be expropriatory (a). The Claimant also alleges that it held rights capable of expropriation (b) and that the challenged measures amount to both a direct and indirect expropriation of its investments.\n\n**a. The Standard for Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Definition of Expropriation Under Article VIII of the BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the concept of expropriation provided in Article VIII of the BIT covers any measure having an effect \u201cequivalent to\u201d nationalization or expropriation and therefore encompasses direct and indirect expropriation.1012\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 251.\n\n632.\n\nRelying on *Quiborax* and *Burlington,* the Claimant argues that a direct expropriation occurs \u201cwhere a measure permanently deprives an investor of its property by forcibly taking or transferring the property to the State.\u201d1013 The Claimant further asserts that \u201c[a]n indirect expropriation occurs where a measure, or a combination of measures, substantially interfere with the investor\u2019s ability to use or derive the economic benefits from an investment established in the territory of the host State, even if it is not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\u201d1014\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 252, citing *Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v.

Merits, \u00b6 256; *Burlington Resources*, \u00b6 401, Exh. **CL-0023**; *Vivendi II,* \u00b6 7.5.20, Exh. **CL-0029**.\n\n634.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that an expropriation is lawful and complies with Article VIII of the BIT when the following requirements are met: (i) it is for a public purpose; (ii) it was conducted in accordance with due process of law; (iii) it was conducted on a non-discriminatory basis; and (iv) prompt, adequate and effective compensation was paid.1016\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 275.\n\n***(ii) Judicial Measures Can Be Expropriatory***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nThe Claimant argues that judicial measures can be expropriatory, since Article VIII of the BIT draws no distinction between expropriations conducted through executive, legislative or judicial measures.1017 Relying on *Rumeli,* it submits that \u201ca taking by the judicial arm of the State may also amount to an expropriation.\u201d1018 Along the same lines as its argumentation in respect of FET, the Claimant disputes that judicial measures can only breach the prohibition against unlawful expropriation under international law if they constitute a denial of justice, as the Respondent suggests, for the following reasons.1019\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 258; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 668.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 258, citing *Rumeli,* \u00b6 702, Exh. **CL-0075**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 668.\n\n636.\n\nFirst, the Claimant argues that the Respondent cannot raise the compliance with its domestic legal framework as a defense to expropriation.1020 Relying on *ATA,* the Claimant submits that \u201ca State cannot invoke its internal laws to evade obligations imposed by a given treaty or generally by public international law.\u201d1021\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 670.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 670, citing *ATA*, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122, 128, Exh. **CL-0016**.\n\n637.\n\nSecond, relying on *Biwater*, the Claimant asserts that investment tribunals have repeatedly confirmed that denial of justice is not a requirement for a judicial measure to amount to an expropriation.1022 For instance, in *Rumeli,* the tribunal held that \u201cthe final decision of Kazakhstan\u2019s Supreme Court affirming the compulsory redemption of the claimant\u2019s shares amounted to unlawful expropriation, even though the decision was made \u2018in accordance with due process of law.\u2019\u201d1023 In *Sistem,* the tribunal found that the invalidation of a share purchase agreement constituted an expropriation because it had the effect of abrogating the claimant\u2019s ownership rights in a hotel. As noted by the tribunal in *Sistem*, States are \u201cnot immune from liability for this expropriation simply because the state organs that had carried out the expropriation were judicial entities.\u201d1024\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 671 (a); *Biwater Gauff,* \u00b6\u00b6 457-458, Exh. **CL-0021**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 671(b); *Rumeli,* \u00b6\u00b6 705-706, Exh. **CL-0075**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 671; *Sistem*, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118, Exh. **CL-0082**.\n\n638.\n\nThird, the Claimant argues that the cases cited by the Respondent and by Canada are not material for the present dispute. The tribunal in *Azinian* did not find that a denial of justice is always a requirement for a finding of expropriation, but rather that tribunals can impose international responsibility on a State for multiple types of breaches including denial of justice. In any event, the Claimant stresses that no judicial measure was challenged in *Azinian.1025* In the same vein, the Claimant argues that the tribunal in *Loewen* did not purport to limit judicial expropriations in all cases to denial of justice.1026\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 672.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 673.\n\n**b. The Claimant\u2019s Rights Were Capable of Expropriation**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its rights were capable of expropriation. Indeed, Article VIII of the BIT protects \u201cinvestments of investors\u201d against unlawful expropriation, which notion includes the exploitation Concession, the pre-existing mining rights, the shares in Industrias Infinito, the money lent to Industrias Infinito and invested throughout the Project\u2019s life, the other Project approvals and the property associated with the Project.1027 The Claimant challenges that it held no valid rights capable of being expropriated following their annulment by the Costa Rican courts.1028\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 260.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 654.\n\n640.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the Respondent is estopped from raising the illegality of such rights as a defense in this arbitration.1029 Indeed, Costa Rica\u2019s Government -through the acts of SETENA, SINAC, DGM, MINAE, various Ministers, the President of Costa Rica and the Constitutional Chamber - led the Claimant to believe that its rights were valid by upholding them and encouraging Infinito to carry on with the Project.1030 More precisely, the Claimant argues that \u201c[i]f the 2002 Moratorium applied to the [P]roject, then the Government should not have restored the exploitation concession, granted the EIA, declared the [P]roject to be in the national interest, or granted the change of land use permit.\u201d1031 Further, the Claimant stresses that its witness, Mr. Ag\u00fcero, confirmed that the Government understood that Industrias Infinito had valid rights.1032\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 661.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 661, 665.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 666.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 667; CWS-Ag\u00fcero 1, \u00b6 35.\n\n641.\n\nAccording to Infinito, its position is echoed by various arbitral decisions. In particular, the tribunal in *ADC* rejected the State\u2019s argument that the relevant agreements were illegal because it had performed these agreements for several years.1033 In *Kardassopoulos,* the tribunal dismissed the respondents\u2019 illegality argument as the State had endorsed the investment.1034\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 663.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 664.\n\n642.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s argument only applies to the resolutions granting Industrias Infinito its Concession and other key approvals. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not affect the pre-existing mining rights. Rather, the 2012 MINAET Resolution expropriated the Claimant\u2019s pre-mining rights by archiving Industrias Infinito\u2019s file in the Mining Registry and declaring the Crucitas area free of mining rights in accordance with the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban.1035\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 655-656.\n\n643.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s contentions, Industrias Infinito\u2019s pre-existing mining rights were capable of expropriation for two reasons. First, pursuant to Articles 23 and 26 of the Mining Code, \u201can exploration permit holder becomes entitled as of right to an exploitation concession once it proves the existence of an exploitable deposit and meets defined statutory conditions,\u201d1036 a matter on which the Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. L\u00e9on expressed no opinion.1037\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 658.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 659.\n\n644.\n\nSecond, it is not true that Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploration permit had expired. Relying on Dr. Araya\u2019s expert report, the Claimant submits that \u201c[a]n exploration permit expires only if the permit holder fails to apply for an exploitation concession within sixty days of the permit\u2019s expiry, not if its conditions are met and the permit holder moves onto the next stage in the process.\u201d1038 Industrias Infinito was thus an exploration permit holder that had applied for an exploitation concession and its prior rights remained acquired.1039\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 660; CER-Araya 1, \u00b6\u00b6 74-75.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 660; CER-Araya 1, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 120, 162, 172.\n\n**c. The Respondent Expropriated the Claimant\u2019s Investments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) The Expropriation Was Direct and Indirect***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, by annulling the Claimant\u2019s rights, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision permanently deprived Infinito of its investments in Costa Rica.1040 The Claimant contends that this expropriation was both direct and indirect.1041\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 263.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 246-248; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 649.\n\n*a. Direct Expropriation*\n-------------------------\n\n646.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s submission that, through the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the Respondent directly expropriated (i) the exploitation Concession, (ii) other project approvals, and (iii) its pre-existing mining rights.1042\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 262.\n\n647.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the cancellation of its Concession is a classic case of direct expropriation. Infinito defines the Concession as \u201ca bundle of legal rights to which Industrias Infinito became entitled in 2001, when it proved the existence of a gold deposit at Crucitas [...] and had complied with all of its obligations as an exploration permit holder.\u201d The Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision took these rights away from Industrias Infinito and thereby expropriated the Concession.1043\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 264.\n\n648.\n\nThe other project approvals are likewise \u201cbundles of legal rights that conferred on Industrias Infinito certain rights in connection with the development, construction and operation of the Crucitas gold mine,\u201d including the 2005 EIA approval, the 2005 declaration of environmental viability and the 2008 approval of project modifications and granting of environmental viability.1044 For the Claimant, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision also directly expropriated these rights.1045\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 265.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 265.\n\n649.\n\nThat said, the Claimant argues that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision did not impact its pre-existing mining rights because \u201c[i]f the final act, such as the resolution granting a concession, is annulled, the rights-holder reverts to the position it was in immediately before the final act was granted.\u201d1046 Accordingly, the Claimant was entitled under its exploration permit to apply for a new concession and new project approvals in order to carry out the Crucitas Project.1047 However, the 2012 MINAET Resolution expropriated the pre-mining rights by extinguishing them. Moreover, the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban barred open-pit mining and thereby prevented the Claimant from obtaining new rights to build and operate the Crucitas mine.1048\n\nC-Mem.

Indirect Expropriation*\n---------------------------\n\n650.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent indirectly expropriated its other investments, including its shares in Industrias Infinito, the funds it invested into its subsidiary and the property associated with the Crucitas Project.\n\n651.\n\nMore precisely, the Claimant argues that with the loss of Industrias Infinito\u2019s Concession and related rights, the Claimant\u2019s other investments immediately became substantially and permanently worthless.1049 The Claimant stresses that Industrias Infinito\u2019s share value began to fall on 30 November 2011 because of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and dropped to zero in March 2013.1050 Relying on the expert report of FTI, the Claimant submits that the fall in Industrias Infinito\u2019s share value shows \u201cthe market\u2019s perception of the magnitude of the impact of the alleged wrongful acts on Infinito\u2019s investment.\u201d1051\n\nC-Mem.

Rather, the Claimant argues that the test is entirely objective and consists in assessing whether the host State deprived the investor of its investment or altered the economic value of these investments.1052\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 677.\n\n653.\n\nAccording to the Claimant and contrary to the Respondent\u2019s contentions, the police powers doctrine is narrow and does not apply in the present case because the challenged measures served no public purpose.\n\n*a. There Is No Broad \u201cPublic Purpose\u201d Exception to Expropriation*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n654.\n\nFor the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s broad definition of the public purpose exception, under which any measure adopted for public interest or in good faith is covered by this exception, is inconsistent with the BIT and with the jurisprudence.1053\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 679.\n\n655.\n\nFirst, the Claimant emphasizes that an expropriation is lawful when it meets four requirements, including that it serves a public purpose. Following Costa Rica\u2019s arguments, it would escalate the public purpose requirement from a condition for a lawful expropriation to a bar to a finding of expropriation, irrespective of the other preconditions.1054\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 680.\n\n656.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that, as noted in *Quiborax, Burlington, Tecmed* and *Saluka,* the police powers doctrine is narrow.1055 Relying on the decision in *Vivendi II,* the Claimant argues that \u201c[i]f public purpose automatically immuni[z]es measures from being found to be expropriatory, then there would never be a compensable taking for a public purpose.\u201d1056 Most investment arbitration decisions held that the police powers doctrine only applies when the measure (i) is truly necessary and proportionate to its stated rationale; (ii) is not contrary to the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations; (iii) does not otherwise breach international obligations; or (iv) is not contrary to domestic law.1057\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 682; *Quiborax* Award, \u00b6 200, Exh. **CL-0074**; *Burlington Resources*, \u00b6 506, Exh. **CL-0023**; *Tecmed,* \u00b6 119, Exh. **CL-0085**; *Saluka,* \u00b6\u00b6 258, 263, Exh. **CL-0077**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 681, citing, *Vivendi II*, \u00b6 7.5.21, Exh. **CL-0029**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 682.\n\n657.\n\nInfinito further notes that the Respondent has not referred to any case in support of its argument \u201cthat any measure aimed at general welfare and adopted in good faith will be exempted from to [sic] Article VIII\u2019s prohibition against unlawful expropriation, unless it is \u2018obviously disproportionate\u2019.\u201d1058 In *Philip Morris* and in *Chemtura,* the tribunals accepted that the respondent States had exercised their police powers because the measures were required to prevent scientifically established harm to public health. Likewise, in *Saluka,* the respondent\u2019s banking system was at stake.1059\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 683.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 683; *Philip Morris,* \u00b6\u00b6 284-286, Exh. **RL-0222**; *Saluka,* \u00b6\u00b6 262-265, 270-275, Exh. **CL-0077**; *Chemtura,* \u00b6 266, Exh. **CL-0025**.\n\n658.\n\nFinally, relying on *Santa Elena,* the Claimant submits that \u201c[e]xpropriatory environmental measures - no matter how laudable or beneficial to society as a whole - are in this respect, similar to any other expropriatory measures that a state may implement in order to implement its policies: where property is expropriated, even for environmental purposes, whether domestic or international, the state\u2019s obligation to pay compensation remains.\u201d1060\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 684, citing *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Final Award, 17 February 2000 (\u201c***Santa Elena***\")*,* \u00b6 71, Exh. **CL-0030**.\n\n*b. The Police Powers Doctrine Has No Application in the Present Case*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n659.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant denies that the Respondent adopted the challenged measures in good faith and for the legitimate purpose of protecting the environment.1061\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 685.\n\n660.\n\nFirst, the Claimant argues that there is no evidence on record establishing that the Crucitas Project was harmful for the environment. To the contrary, the Claimant stresses that Costa Rica\u2019s authorities, including SETENA, SINAC and the Constitutional Chamber, found that the Project was consistent with Costa Rican environmental law. In the same vein, the Claimant puts forward that the executive branch defended the Crucitas Project before the Costa Rican courts. Finally, the Claimant argues that the 2002 Moratorium and the 2012 MINAET Resolution merely reflect a change in policy following the election of President Chinchilla.1062\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 687-688.\n\n661.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that Costa Rica enacted the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (i) in violation of the Political Constitution and (ii) to prevent the Crucitas Project from proceeding.1063\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 689.\n\n662.\n\nThird, Infinito emphasizes that the Respondent\u2019s \u201crecent conduct belies its argument that concern for the environment motivated the cancellation of the Crucitas [P]roject.\u201d1064 Indeed, as noted by President Arias, \u201c[t]he environmental devastation caused by the illegal mining in Crucitas is a tragedy that, unfortunately, we could have avoided.\u201d1065 The Claimant contends that Costa Rica did nothing to prevent these illegal activities and the resulting harm to the environment.1066\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 690.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 690, citing Press Release, \u201cWhy did I approve the Crucitas Project?\u201d, La Naci\u00f3n (15 January 2019), Exh. **C-0753**.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 690.\n\n663.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant argues that the Respondent did not establish that the measures were proportionate and necessary to protect the environment, and thus the expropriation is not exempted under the police powers doctrine.1067\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 691.\n\n**d. The Expropriation Was Unlawful**\n-------------------------------------\n\n664.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the expropriation did not meet the legality requirement set in Article VIII of the BIT.\n\n665.\n\nFirst, the expropriation was not for a public purpose. Relying on the decision in *ADC* and on ILC reports, the Claimant explains that this condition \u201crequires some genuine interest of the public\u201d and is not a self-judging standard.1068 The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, however served no public purpose,1069 as \u201c[f]ar from having achieved any social good, the cancellation of the Crucitas gold mine has deprived an already economically depressed community of jobs, revenue, and social and physical infrastructure.\u201d1070\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 276-278, citing *ADC*, \u00b6 423, Exh. **CL-0009**.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 280.\n\nC-Mem. Merits. \u00b6 280.\n\n666.\n\nSecond, the expropriation was not completed in accordance with due process. Invoking *ADC,* the Claimant argues that \u201c\u2018due process of law\u2019, in the expropriation context, demands an actual and substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against the depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it.\u201d1071 Industrias Infinito had no knowledge, so says the Claimant, that it would have to submit arguments as to the application of the 2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession. Indeed, this issue was not part of the complaint filed before the TCA. As a result, Industrias Infinito only had the opportunity to make brief submissions on this issue. The Claimant further argues that the Administrative Chamber did not cure this procedural flaw \u201cgiven that the Administrative Chamber proceeding was an appeal rather than a hearing at first instance.\u201d1072\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 281, citing *ADC*, \u00b6 435, Exh. **CL-0009**.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 283.\n\n667.\n\nThird, the Claimant draws attention to the fact that Costa Rica has paid no compensation to Industrias Infinito or to the Claimant, contrary to Article VIII of the BIT which requires the payment of a compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the investment.1073\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 287.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimant Had No Mining Rights Capable of Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \u201c[t]here can be no expropriation of a right that does not exist\u201d in the first place.1074 Invoking the award in *Vestey,* the Respondent submits that \u201c[f]or a private person to have a claim under international law arising from the deprivation of its property it must hold that property in accordance with applicable rules of domestic law.\u201d1075 Likewise, the tribunal in *EnCana* ruled that \u201cfor there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return [...] the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them, in this case, the law of Ecuador.\u201d1076\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 504, 506; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 612; *Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, (\u201c***Vestey***\"), \u00b6 257, Exh. **CL-0206**; *EnCana Corporation v.

Merits, \u00b6 613.\n\n670.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s submission, the Respondent asserts that the same is true of Industrias Infinito\u2019s alleged pre-existing mining rights. As a preliminary matter, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s position on this point is unclear, as it argued in its Memorial that the expropriatory measure was the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, and later in its Reply that it was the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and the 2012 MINAET Resolution.1078\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 616.\n\n671.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent considers that Industrias Infinito had no pre-existing mining rights since an exploration permit holder is not entitled as of right to an exploitation concession, as confirmed by the TCA and Dr. Le\u00f3n,1079 and Industrias Infinito\u2019s exploration permit expired in September 1999.1080 The Respondent stresses that this fact was not disputed until the Claimant\u2019s Reply, and that the Claimant\u2019s witness Mr. Juan Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez admitted that the exploration permit had expired in 1999.1081\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 510; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 617; RER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 190; RER-Le\u00f3n 2, \u00b6 26.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 510; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 618; RER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 308, 337.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 618; CWS-Hern\u00e1ndez 1, \u00b6 72 (\u201c[T]he term of the exploration permit expired on September 18, 1999\u201d).\n\n672.\n\nThe Respondent adds that, even assuming that Industrias Infinito had held pre-existing mining rights, the outcome would still have been same. The 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on those alleged rights,1082 as the 2010 Executive Moratoria, which entered into force in 2010 before the cut-off date under the BIT, already prevented the Claimant from applying for a new concession. In other words, \u201cirrespective of the Legislative Moratorium and the 2012 MINAE Resolution, Industrias Infinito could not have obtained an exploitation concession following the annulment of its 2008 Concession.\u201d1083\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 620; RER-Le\u00f3n 1, \u00b6\u00b6 300-304.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 620.\n\n673.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that \u201cthe Claimant\u2019s lack of any valid mining right also defeats its indirect expropriation claim.\u201d1084 This is because the value of the assets allegedly subjected to indirect expropriation depended on the validity of the 2008 Concession and related rights.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 511; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 621.\n\n**b. The Respondent Is Not Estopped from Arguing that the Claimant\u2019s Rights Were not Valid**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n674.\n\nThe Respondent disputes being estopped from relying on the invalidity of the Claimant\u2019s rights because its executive branch spent a decade upholding the validity of such rights.1085\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 622.\n\n675.\n\nFirst, Costa Rica asserts that \u201c[t]he [...] decade to which the Claimant refers in its Reply was a stretch of unremitting uncertainty about the validity of Industrias Infinito\u2019s purported mining rights.\u201d1086 It underlines that between the granting of the 2002 Concession and the annulment in 2010 of the 2008 Concession, various proceedings were initiated as to the validity of the Claimant\u2019s rights: On 1 April 2002, environmental activists filed an *amparo* against the 2002 Concession, which led to its annulment in 2004; the 2008 Concession was also immediately suspended by the filing of *amparo* petitions; from 12 June 2002 to 4 June 2008 and from 29 April 2010 onwards, open-pit mining was prohibited by either the 2002 Moratorium, the 2010 Executive Moratoria or the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, which demonstrates that \u201cthere was no abrupt change in the conditions of the mining activity.\u201d1087\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 623.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 623.\n\n676.\n\nDuring this period, Costa Rica\u2019s executive branch never represented to the Claimant that (i) its rights were exempt from legal or judicial scrutiny or that (ii) the judicial branch would necessarily confirm the legality of its rights.1088 To the contrary, \u201c[t]he fact that some administrative agencies worked to advance the Crucitas Mining Project only reaffirms that Costa Rica acted in good faith in respect of the Claimant\u2019s investment.\u201d1089\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 624.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 633.\n\n677.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the cases which the Claimant cites are inapposite as they all relate to the admissibility of a jurisdictional objection based on the alleged illegality of the investor\u2019s investment.1090 For Costa Rica, the estoppel theory is not applicable here since it \u201ccan neither create rights that did not exist, nor make the Tribunal ignore the fact that the alleged rights in question were declared void in fair judicial proceedings before the Costa Rican Courts.\u201d1091 Further, in *Kardassopoulos, Railroad Development* and *Fraport*, the objection to jurisdiction was not admissible because both parties conducted themselves for years as if the relevant agreements were legal. Here, Costa Rica did not conduct itself as if the 2008 Concession was legal and never represented so to the Claimant.1092\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 625-628; *ADC,* \u00b6\u00b6 474-475, Exh. **CL-0009**; *Kardassopoulos,* \u00b6 183, Exh. **CL-0208**; *Railroad Development Corporation v.

Merits, \u00b6 628.\n\n678.\n\nThird, invoking *Arif,* the Respondent submits that \u201cCosta Rica cannot be held liable at an international level for the correct application by Costa Rican Courts of Costa Rican law in lawsuits filed by a third party.\u201d1093 Otherwise, a State would be denied the possibility to review the legality of executive measures, which would be inconsistent with the separation of powers. According to the Respondent, \u201c[i]f every declaration of annulment of an illegally granted concession following fair judicial proceedings could be considered as an expropriation, States would be unable to enforce their laws against investors.\u201d1094\n\nR-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 632.\n\n679.\n\nFourth, the Respondent denies that the Government misled the Claimant into making further investments in the Project. In the alternative, the Respondent argues that the Costa Rican judicial system provided the Claimant with a mechanism to dispel any doubt as to whether the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision annulled the 2002 Concession with absolute or relative effects. The Respondent cites in this regard the decision in *Amto,* pursuant to which \u201c[an] investor that fails to exercise his rights within a legal system, or exercises its rights unwisely, cannot pass his own responsibility for the outcome to the administration of justice, and from there to the host State in international law.\u201d1095\n\nR-Rej.

Judicial Measures Cannot Constitute an Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n680.\n\nThe Respondent and Canada submit that judicial measures cannot constitute an expropriation because \u201cin [the] absence of a denial of justice, there is no basis for an international tribunal to interfere with a domestic court\u2019s determination of what rights exist at domestic law.\u201d1096\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 636, citing Canada's Submission, \u00b6 38.\n\n681.\n\nRelying on the legal test laid down in *Azinian,* the Respondent submits that, to find that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investments, the Tribunal must be convinced that (i) domestic legal standards violate Costa Rica\u2019s international law obligations under the BIT; (ii) the Costa Rican courts themselves are disavowed at the international level (for instance, as a result of a denial of justice); or (iii) the Costa Rican courts were not only wrong with respect to the invalidity of the 2008 Concession, but there has been a pretense of form to achieve an internationally unlawful end. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet this test. It has not argued that the legal framework on which the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was grounded was expropriatory, nor has it proved a denial of justice or a pretense of form to achieve an internationally wrongful end.1097\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 518-522; *Azinian,* \u00b6\u00b6 96-99, Exh. **CL-0017**.\n\n**d. The Respondent\u2019s Measures are Covered by the Police Powers Doctrine**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s case that all of the impugned measures were *\u201cbona fide,* proportionate regulations aimed at the general welfare.\u201d As a result, they represented a legitimate use of the State\u2019s police powers and could not give rise to a claim for expropriation.1098\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 523.\n\n683.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the police powers doctrine \u201cprotects a State\u2019s right to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare.\u201d1099 Relying on *Philip Morris, S.D. Myers, Saluka* and *LG&E,* the Respondent argues that a measure is valid under this doctrine if (i) it is adopted in good faith; (ii) it is not obviously disproportionate; and (iii) it aims at the general welfare.1100\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 524.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 524-528; *Philip Morris,* \u00b6 307, Exh. **RL-0222**; *S.D.

Merits, \u00b6 655, citing *Philip Morris,* \u00b6 295, Exh. **RL-0222**.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 530-532; *Feldman,* \u00b6 103, Exh. **CL-0038**; *Chemtura,* \u00b6 266, Exh. **CL-0025**; Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union, 30 October 2016 (\u201cCETA Canada-EU\u201d), Article 8.12 with reference to Annex 8-A, Exh. **RL-0224**.\n\n685.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s arguments, the first step in the analysis is not whether there has been a deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s investment and if that deprivation was permanent. In the two cases cited by the Claimant *(Quiborax* and *Burlington),* the tribunal chose to start with the assessment of the third requirement, namely whether the measure was a legitimate exercise of the police powers doctrine.1103\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 655-656; *Quiborax* Award, \u00b6 227, Exh. **CL-0074**; *Burlington Resources,* \u00b6 529, Exh. **CL-0023**.\n\n686.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the challenged measures (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban) fall within the police powers doctrine, because they were *bona fide,* proportionate and aimed at the general welfare.1104 These measures \u201cwere all taken in order to maintain or enforce prior measures that had the overriding purpose of protecting the environment from the possible negative effects of open-pit mining.\u201d1105 Specifically, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAET Resolution both upheld measures whose aim was to protect the environment. Indeed, they both maintained and enforced the 2010 TCA Decision, which in turn had confirmed the application of the 2002 Moratorium to the 2002 Concession as a result of the Constitutional Chamber\u2019s annulment of that concession in 2004.1106 As for the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban, it was issued as a safeguard against a possible repeat of the 2010 Executive Moratoria and, like those Moratoria, was motivated by legitimate concerns about the environmental impact of open-pit mining.1107\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 529, 536.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 533.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 534.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 535.\n\n687.\n\nIn contrast to the Claimant\u2019s position, it is not necessary for Costa Rica to prove that the Crucitas Project would have been harmful for the environment; it is sufficient for it to demonstrate that Costa Rican courts applied the laws and regulations correctly.1108 The Respondent argues in this respect that the challenged measures were based primarily on the 2002 Moratorium, which sought to \u201censure a balance between the activities and their possible consequences on the environment, aimed at the protection of human health, and the natural, economic and social equilibrium.\u201d1109 In any event, the record shows that the Crucitas Project gave rise to numerous environmental concerns.1110\n\nR-Rej.

There Is No Causal Link Between the Loss or Damage and the Allegedly Expropriatory Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n690.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, for an expropriation to occur under international law, \u201c[t]he investor must be deprived of all or nearly all of the benefits and value of the investment.\u201d1115 The investor must also \u201cidentify the necessary causal link between the substantial loss or near destruction of the value of the investment and the challenged measure that allegedly led to that loss or radical deprivation.\u201d1116 According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to establish that the challenged measures (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAET Resolution, and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban) are the cause of the deprivation of its investment.1117\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 538.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 538.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 540.\n\n691.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the evidence shows that the loss occurred with the 2010 TCA Decision and not at a later date,1118 which the Claimant actually recognized in a press release.1119\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 541, citing CER-Credibility 1, \u00b6 72.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 542; Infinito Gold Ltd.

Canada\u2019s Position**\n------------------------\n\n694.\n\nCanada submits that the expropriation standard under the BIT, reflects customary international law and forms part of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.1127 It notes that, for a measure to amount to an expropriation under Article VIII of the BIT, \u201cthere must be a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either directly or indirectly, that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of the investment.\u201d1128\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\n695.\n\nAccording to Canada, the first step in an expropriation analysis is the identification of the investment allegedly expropriated.1129 When determining legal entitlements under domestic law, international tribunals should defer to domestic court rulings.1130 Canada further considers that \u201ca non-discriminatory measure that is designed to protect legitimate public welfare objectives does not constitute indirect expropriation, except in rare circumstances where its impacts are so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith.\u201d1131\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 34.\n\n**4. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n696.\n\nThe Tribunal will first set out the standard for expropriation (a). It will then address whether there has been a direct expropriation (b) and/or an indirect expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s investments (c). In the affirmative, the Tribunal will determine whether the expropriation was unlawful (d).\n\n**a. The Standard for Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n697.\n\nArticle VIII of the Costa Rica-Canada BIT provides:1132\n\nInvestments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018expropriation') in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall be based on the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or at the time the proposed expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier. [...]\n\nBIT, Article VIII, Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n698.\n\nThe Parties appear to be in agreement on the standard for expropriation. The Claimant has cited the formulation set out in *Quiborax* and *Burlington* as to what measures amount to direct and indirect expropriations,1133 and the Respondent has not contested it nor given a different version of the standard.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253, citing *Quiborax* Award, \u00b6 200, Exh. **CL-0074**; *Burlington Resources,* \u00b6 506, Exh. **CL-0023**.\n\n699.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees. A State measure constitutes expropriation if (i) the measure deprives the investor of its investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine.1134 An expropriation is direct when the deprivation occurs through a forcible taking or transfer of the property to the State.1135 It is indirect when the measure \u201csubstantially interfere[s] with the investor\u2019s ability to use or derive the economic benefits from an investment established in the territory of the host State, even if it is not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\u201d1136\n\n*Burlington Resources,* \u00b6 506, Exh. **CL-0023**; *Quiborax* Award, \u00b6 200; Exh. **CL-0074**.\n\n*Burlington Resources,* \u00b6 506, Exh. **CL-0023**; *Quiborax* Award, \u00b6 200; Exh. **CL-0074.**\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 253, citing *Metalclad,* \u00b6 103, Exh. **CL-0058**; *Occidental,* \u00b6 87, Exh. **CL-0066**.\n\n700.\n\nIf a measure amounts to an expropriation under such test, the Tribunal must assess whether the expropriation was lawful. Pursuant to Article VIII of the BIT, the expropriation is lawful if it is (i) made for a public purpose, (ii) under due process of law, (iii) in a non-discriminatory manner and (iv) against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. These requirements are cumulative, such that failure to meet any one of them makes the expropriation wrongful.\n\n701.\n\nWhile the Parties appear to concur on this standard, they diverge on whether a judicial decision may effect an expropriation if it does not amount to a denial of justice. For the reasons given in Section VI.C.1.d(iii) *supra* (on FET), a majority of the Tribunal answers this question in the affirmative, provided that the requirements for an expropriation set out in paragraph 699 *supra* are met.\n\n**b. Has There Been a Direct Expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s Investments?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, through the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAET Resolution, Costa Rica directly expropriated its Concession, project approvals and pre-existing mining rights.1137 The Respondent retorts that no expropriation could have taken place, because the Claimant did not hold rights capable of being expropriated, the judicial measures did not constitute a denial of justice, and the measures were adopted in accordance with the police powers doctrine to enforce underlying measures aimed at protecting the environment against open-pit mining activities.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 262; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 649.\n\n703.\n\nAt paragraph 175 *supra,* the Tribunal has held that the 2008 Concession and Industrias Infinito\u2019s other pre-existing mining rights did not qualify as \u201cinvestments\u201d of the Claimant under Article I(g) of the Treaty, because they are assets controlled indirectly by the Claimant through a host State enterprise that do not fall within the scope of the Treaty\u2019s definition of investment. For the same reason, these assets do not qualify as investment that can be expropriated directly in breach of Article VIII of the Treaty. While a State measure resulting in the loss of the 2008 Concession and other rights might potentially lead to the destruction of value of the shares of Industrias Infinito, this could only qualify as an indirect expropriation.\n\n704.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the Parties have not raised this point. The Respondent\u2019s main argument is not that the 2008 Concession does not qualify as a direct investment; it is that this Concession was not valid under domestic law, and as result was not capable of being expropriated. The Tribunal will thus address the Claimant\u2019s direct expropriation claim as the Parties have argued it, noting that the outcome would not be different.\n\n705.\n\nAs this claim has been framed by the Parties, the Tribunal must first determine whether the Claimant (through Industrias Infinito) held rights capable of being expropriated.1138 If no valid rights exist under domestic law, there can be no expropriation.1139\n\n*See e. g.*, *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A. S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009 (\u201c***Bayindir***\u201d), \u00b6 442, Exh. **CL-0019** (\u201cThe first step in assessing the existence of an expropriation is to identify the assets allegedly expropriated.\u201d).\n\n*Vestey,* \u00b6 257, Exh. **CL-0206**; *EnCana,* \u00b6 184, Exh. **RL-0127**; *Arif,* \u00b6\u00b6 417, 420, Exh. **CL-0014**; *Emmis,* \u00b6\u00b6 161-162, **RL-0086**; *Accession,* \u00b6 75, Exh. **RL-0175**.\n\n706.\n\nAs explained in *Vestey,* the existence of rights subject to expropriation must be assessed immediately before the adoption of the measures impugned.1140 The Tribunal will thus assess whether Industrias Infinito held any valid rights immediately before 30 November 2011, the date of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. As discussed in Section V.D.3.b(i) *supra,* this is when the annulment became definitive and the consequent loss of value to the Claimant\u2019s investment became permanent.1141\n\n*Vestey,* \u00b6 254, Exh. **CL-0206**.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 239-241.\n\n707.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the exploitation Concession, project approvals and pre-existing mining rights form a bundle of rights that qualify as \u201cinvestments of investors\u201d under Article I(g) of the BIT and are thus protected under Article VIII.1142 The Respondent, for its part, argues that the Concession and related project approvals were not validly granted because (i) the 2010 TCA Decision confirmed that the 2002 Concession was null *ab initio* and that Industrias Infinito had no right covered by the 2002 Moratorium\u2019s grandfathering provision; and (ii) the 2008 Concession was granted when the 2002 Moratorium was still in effect.1143 It also contends that Industrias Infinito held no valid pre-existing mining rights, as its exploration permit had expired in September 1999.\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6 260; C-Reply Merits, \u00b6 655.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 507-509; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 613.\n\n708.\n\nAs it was already made clear in the analysis of the claims of denial of justice and breach of FET, for the Tribunal Industrias Infinito held no valid Concession and related approvals capable of being expropriated. It is undisputed that the 2002 Concession was annulled by the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision. The TCA regarded this annulment as absolute, with the result that the 2002 Concession was null and void *ab initio,* a finding confirmed by the Administrative Chamber in 2011.\n\n709.\n\nWhile the Claimant disagrees with the Administrative Chamber\u2019s conclusion and argues that the nullity was only relative, it is common ground that the Government did not attempt to cure such nullity with a validation or remediation (as requested by Industrias Infinito), but purported to \u201cconvert\u201d the 2002 Concession in 2008. The Tribunal understands that, if it had been effective, the conversion would have resulted in a new concession.1144 In other words, a successful conversion would have had the same effect as the grant of a new concession; it would not have restored the 2002 Concession. There can thus be no doubt that, on 30 November 2011, Industrias Infinito held no valid rights over the 2002 Concession.\n\nGeneral Law of Public Administration, Law No. 6227 (5 February 1978), Exh. **C-0014**, Article 189 (\u201c1. The invalid act, absolute or relatively void, may be converted into ***a different valid one*** by the Administration's express declaration, on the condition that the former meets all formal and material requirements of the latter. 2. ***The conversion takes effect on its date****.*\")(Emphasis added)).\n\n710.\n\nAs to the 2008 Concession and related approvals, the TCA held in 2010 (and the Administrative Chamber upheld a year later) that the conversion had been improper and that in any event the Government had granted the 2008 Concession and related approvals while the 2002 Moratorium was still in effect. Accordingly, the TCA annulled the 2008 Concession and approvals, annulment which was confirmed by the Administrative Chamber.\n\n711.\n\nAs discussed above, the Tribunal must focus on the moment immediately preceding the Administrative Chamber Decision on 30 November 2011. At that time, the 2008 Concession and related approvals which Industrias Infinito formally held were vitiated by an absolute nullity. Consequently, Industrias Infinito could not be said to have owned valid rights capable of being expropriated.\n\n712.\n\nAs to Industrias Infinito\u2019s alleged pre-existing mining rights, the Tribunal has already found at paragraph 573 *supra* that Industrias Infinito had certain pre-existing mining rights that arose from its status as an exploration permit holder and that the application to the Crucitas Project of the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban (the MINAET Resolution being an ancillary measure not independent of the Ban) violated FET. For reasons of judicial economy, it can be left open whether these pre-existing rights were in addition subject to an expropriation. Indeed, even in the affirmative, no greater harm could be caused than the one generated by the FET breach. As noted when discussing the FET breach, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimant has proved the existence of a quantifiable harm, and finds that that any alleged harm is in any event too speculative to give rise to an award of damages.\n\n**c. Has There Been an Indirect Expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s Remaining Investments?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Respondent indirectly expropriated its other investments in Costa Rica, namely: (i) the shares in Industrias Infinito, which it acquired in 2000; (ii) the funds it invested in Industrias Infinito; (iii) the physical assets associated with the Project, including the half-built mining infrastructure; and (iv) the intangible assets associated with the Project. The Claimant argues that, with the loss of the Concession, these other investments became substantially and permanently worthless.1145\n\nC-Mem. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 268, 269, 271.\n\n714.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant validly held these assets prior to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the Tribunal has noted as much when discussing jurisdiction.1146 Rather, its case is that the Claimant\u2019s main investment was the Concession, and that the value of these remaining investments depended on the Concession.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 174; Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 175(b).\n\n715.\n\nFor present purposes, the Tribunal considers it necessary to distinguish what assets were held by the Claimant, and which by Industrias Infinito. It appears undisputed that the Claimant indirectly held the shares in Industrias Infinito through Crucitas (Barbados) Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of Barbados.1147 The Claimant also asserts that it invested funds into the Project, but the record is not clear as to how these funds were deployed (e.g., whether they were a capital contribution to Industrias Infinito or a shareholder loan). As to the physical and intangible assets, the record suggests that they were owned by Industrias Infinito,1148 and thus formed part of its share value. The Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant\u2019s other assets should be assessed as part of Industria\u2019s Infinito\u2019s value.\n\nCER-FTI Consulting 1, n. 15.\n\nSee, e.g., CER-FTI Consulting 1, \u00b6\u00b6 2.4; 4.14.\n\n716.\n\nIt is evident from the Claimant\u2019s own case that the exploitation Concession for the Crucitas Project was the most valuable asset, upon which the value of Industrias Infinito\u2019s shares (and indeed, of the entire Project) rested. The Claimant\u2019s argument is that, as a result of the loss of the Concession, Industrias Infinito\u2019s shares were substantially deprived of their value.\n\n717.\n\nAs explained above, for a measure to amount to an indirect expropriation, it must cause the deprivation of the investment. It is widely accepted that this deprivation must be substantial,1149 and that there must be a causal link between the measure and the deprivation.1150 Here, the Tribunal finds that there was no causal link between the alleged deprivation and the challenged measures.\n\n*Burlington Resources,* \u00b6\u00b6 396-397, Exh. **CL-0023**; *Quiborax* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 237-238, Exh. **CL-0074**; *Pope & Talbot v.

But this does not mean that, as a legal matter, the decision caused the substantial deprivation of the value of Industrias Infinito. The Administrative Chamber found that the 2008 Concession was vitiated by a legal flaw that rendered it null and void *ab initio.* This means that the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision merely confirmed this legal status. Had this decision been rendered in bad faith, in order to deprive Industrias Infinito of a validly held concession, it would have been open to the Tribunal to assess whether it was expropriatory. However, this is not the case here: as discussed in Section VI.C.2.c *supra,* the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision cannot be characterized as a denial of justice, nor was it fundamentally arbitrary or unfair. It was a *bona fide* decision of the Costa Rican Supreme Court that found that Industrias Infinito did not hold valid rights under Costa Rican law. Accordingly, it cannot be characterized as an expropriatory measure.\n\n719.\n\nIn other words, the value of Industrias Infinito\u2019s shares and other intangibles was premised on an illusion, *i.e.* that the mining rights were valid when they were not. In reality, the Claimant\u2019s shares in Industrias Infinito were already worthless prior to the challenged measures, which can thus not have caused their loss of value.\n\n**F.

The MFN Clause Does Not Allow the Claimant to Benefit from More Favorable Substantive Obligations Contained in Other Treaties**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n727.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the MFN clause in Article IV(a) of the BIT is not a \u201ctreaty-shopping device\u201d but a substantive obligation.1163 The Respondent argues that the protection provided in this clause is subject to three cumulative requirements: the investor must (i) identify an appropriate comparator, chiefly an investment of another investor that is in \u201clike circumstances;\u201d (ii) establish that its investment is being granted treatment in the Respondent\u2019s territory that is \u201cless favourable\u201d than that afforded to the comparator investment in connection to the \u201cenjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition\u201d of the investment; and, (iii) establish that the less favorable treatment which it has received is not objectively justified.1164\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 548; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 725.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 551; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 726.\n\n728.\n\nRelying on *Parkerings, Bayindir* and *I\u00e7kale,* the Respondent explains that an investor can only benefit from the MFN standard if it has established that all the foregoing requirements are met.1165 In the present case, the Claimant failed to establish any of these requirements; it has merely identified provisions contained in other treaties that are allegedly more favorable.1166 However, the Respondent argues that granting the nationals of another State more favorable substantive guarantees does not qualify as \u201ctreatment\u201d within the ordinary meaning of Article IV.1167 Relying on Canada\u2019s Non-Disputing Party Submission, the Respondent describes the standard in Article IV as follows:\n\nIn contrast to the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018treatment\u2019, treaty standards are not behaviour in respect of an entity or a person. Thus, absent measures adopted or maintained by a Contracting Party, substantive obligations and procedural rights in other international treaties do not automatically convert to \u2018treatment\u2019 for the purposes of the MFN obligation and cannot, themselves, give rise to a breach of Article IV(a).1168\n\nR-Rej.

The Respondent Did Not Breach the Alleged Obligation to \u201cDo What is Necessary\u201d**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) The Claimant Has Failed to Show that Article 3 of the France-******Costa Rica BIT Affords Investors More Favorable Treatment***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n730.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimant is entitled to invoke Article 3 of the France-Costa Rica BIT, because this clause does not afford more favorable protection than Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.1170 The former provision speaks of the \u201cexercise of the right so recognized,\u201d which refers back to the right to be treated fairly and equitably addressed in the first part of Article 3.1171 Calling on the award in *Lahoud,* the Respondent argues that the two parts of Article 3 relate to the same test and that the obligation to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d therefore does not \u201cplace any more onerous an obligation on Costa Rica than that already required under the FET clause in the BIT.\u201d1172\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 552; R-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 739.\n\n***(ii) The Respondent Has Not Failed to \u201cDo What is Necessary\u201d***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n732.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the obligation to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d requires the host State to \u201ctake positive steps\u201d to protect an investor\u2019s investment. To the contrary, Article 3 of the French BIT provides for a less burdensome obligation that consists in doing \u201cwhat is necessary so that the Claimant\u2019s right to [FET] [...] is not hindered, either in law or in fact.\u201d1174\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 559.\n\n733.\n\nThat said, the Respondent argues that the Claimant could not reasonably have expected the State to \u201c(i) disregard[] the fact that the Claimant\u2019s investment was fundamentally illegal under Costa Rican law; (ii) refrain[] from exercising its sovereign right and executive powers to protect the environment; and (iii) [...] go[] as far as to overhaul its judicial system.\u201d1175 The Claimant fails to address Costa Rica\u2019s arguments, and merely affirms that Costa Rica failed to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d because it did not redress the inconsistency and unfairness of the judgment of its courts and that, it permanently deprived the Claimant of its mining rights by issuing the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban. For the Respondent, these arguments are flawed because \u201cno reasonable interpretation of the obligation to \u2018do what is necessary\u2019 would require Costa Rica to exempt foreign investments from the application of domestic law,\u201d and because no tribunal has interpreted this provision in this way.1176\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 558; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 742.\n\nR-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 743-744.\n\n734.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that this claim is unfounded because (i) the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban had no impact on Industrias Infinito due to the 2010 Executive Moratoria and (ii) Industrias Infinito had no pre-mining rights anymore since the expiration of its exploration permit.1177\n\nR-Rej.

The Respondent Never Assumed or Breached Any \u201cSpecific Obligation\u201d**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n735.\n\nAccording to Costa Rica, it has never assumed or breached any \u201cspecific obligation.\u201d\n\n736.\n\nFirst, it submits that the BIT Contracting States did not intend to protect investors against the breach of specific obligations, since the BIT contains no umbrella clause. An investor should not be allowed to import an entirely new right into a treaty, which amounts to unilaterally modifying an international treaty, contrary to the drafters\u2019 intent.1178 In reliance on *Teinver,* the Respondent argues that \u201cthe parties to the Treaty were in all likelihood aware of the existence of umbrella clauses and if they had intended to include such a clause in the Treaty, they would have done so.\u201d1179 By contrast, the Respondent contends that the decision in *White Industries* to which the Claimant refers provides no guidance for present purposes, as India did not raise the same argument as Costa Rica, namely that MFN clauses cannot be used to import new rights.1180\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 562; R-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6 750.\n\n737.\n\nSecond, the Respondent alleges that it has \u201cnever assumed the specific obligation on which the Claimant\u2019s argument is premised,\u201d1181 because the 2008 Concession has been found null and void *ab initio* in accordance with domestic law*.*1182\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 566-567; R-Rej.

Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 754-755.\n\n**3. Canada\u2019s Position**\n------------------------\n\n739.\n\nIn its Non-Disputing Party Submission, Canada makes two main submissions with respect to the BIT\u2019s MFN clause.\n\n740.\n\nFirst, it submits that Article IV(a) of the BIT requires a comparison between the treatment accorded to the investment of an investor of a Contracting Party and the treatment accorded to the investment of an investor of a third State. According to Canada, the purpose of this provision which, cannot be applied in the abstract, is to prohibit nationality-based discrimination against investors of the Contracting Party. The investor bears the burden of proving that: \u201c(1) the Contracting Party has granted both the investments of the investor and an investor of a third State \u2018treatment\u2019 with respect to \u2018the enjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or disposition\u2019 of their investments; (2) the alleged treatment was granted \u2018in like circumstances\u2019; and (3) the treatment accorded to the investments of the investor was \u2018less favourable\u2019 than the treatment accorded to the investment of the investor of a third State.\u201d1184\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, citing *UPS* Award, \u00b6 83, **RL-0227**; *Loewen,* \u00b6 139, Exh. **CL-0055**; *Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05, Award, 21 November 2007 (\u201c***Archer Daniels***\")*,* \u00b6 205, Exh. **CL-0013**; *S.D. Myers*, \u00b6 252, Exh. **CL-0078**.\n\n741.\n\nSecond, Canada argues that, when interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, Article IV(a) of the BIT does not allow for the importation of substantive or procedural rights in other treaties, nor was this the Parties\u2019 intention. The term \u201ctreatment\u201d refers to measures adopted or maintained (*i.e.*, \u201ctaken or not taken\u201d) by the Contracting Party, which is confirmed by the wording of other treaty provisions, such as Article XII (which refers to claims by an investor \u201cthat a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement\u201d), and Article XII(2)(b) of the BIT (which provides that when an investor submits a claim, it bears the burden of proving, *inter alia,* \u201cthat the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement.\u201d).1185\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n742.\n\nThe fact that \u201ctreatment\u201d refers to actual measures and not to standards is also corroborated by the reference in Article IV(a) to a comparison in respect of \u201cinvestments in its territory of investors of a third State.\u201d According to Canada, this \u201creflects the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention that the MFN obligation apply to activities in their territory, which is distinct from the dispute settlement procedures and substantive treaty standards that are contained in other international treaties.\u201d1186 Canada further notes that several international investment tribunals have recognized that the phrase \u201cin its territory\u201d is inconsistent with an interpretation of the MFN clause that expands the scope of international arbitration beyond what is explicitly provided for in the treaty.\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 14.\n\n743.\n\nCanada further notes that the chapeau of Article IV provides that the \u201ctreatment\u201d must be \u201cwith respect to investments and the enjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition thereof.\u201d Treatystandards are not \u201ctreatment\u201d, says Canada, because they are not behavior in respect of an entity or a person. Thus, \u201cabsent measures adopted or maintained by a Contracting Party, substantive obligations and procedural rights in other international treaties do not automatically convert to \u2018treatment\u2019 for the purposes of the MFN obligation and cannot, themselves, give rise to a breach of Article IV(a).\u201d1187\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\n744.\n\nFor Canada, the context of Article IV(a) of the BIT confirms this interpretation. The BIT was concluded before *Maffezini* held that more favorable dispute settlement provisions could be imported *via* the MFN clause, and Canada\u2019s subsequent treaty practice confirms that the term \u201ctreatment\u201d does not encompass dispute settlement procedures, and that substantive obligations in other treaties do not in themselves amount to \u201ctreatment\u201d that could give rise to a breach of the MFN clause.1188\n\nCanada's Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n**4. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a. No Need to Determine Whether the MFN Clause Allows the Importation of More Favorable Protections**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nArticle IV(a) of the BIT provides for the most-favored nation (MFN) treatment in the following terms:1189\n\nWith respect to investments and the enjoyment, use, management, conduct, operation, expansion, and sale or other disposition thereof, each Contracting Party shall accord treatment no less favourable than that which, in like circumstances, it grants in respect of:\n\n(a) investments in its territory of investors of a third State;\n\n(b) investments in its territory of its own investors.\n\nBIT, Article IV(a), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n746.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant seeks to rely on two substantive obligations from other treaties: (i) the obligation to do \u201cwhat is necessary\u201d to protect an investor\u2019s investments found in Article 3 of the Costa Rica-France BIT; and (ii) an umbrella clause requiring the State to \u201ccomply with [or observe] any obligation assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,\u201d contained in Article 3(2) of the Taiwan-Costa Rica BIT and Article 10(3) of the Korea-Costa Rica BIT. The Respondent and Canada deny that the Claimant may \u201cimport\u201d obligations from other treaties, because the reference in Article IV(a) to \u201ctreatment,\u201d \u201cin its territory\u201d and \u201cin like circumstances\u201d means that the MFN clause is limited to the material treatment of an investor and does not extend to substantive obligations in other treaties.1190\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 548; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 718, 720, 726, 731-733.\n\n747.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it can dispense with resolving the Parties\u2019 divergence on whether the MFN clause entitles an investor to import a more favorable protection found in a third party treaty into the basic treaty, *i.e.* the BIT, or whether the investor must show an actual difference in treatment between him/herself and another investor who is in like circumstances. Indeed, even assuming that the importation of a more favorable guarantee were sufficient, *i.e.* assuming that Infinito\u2019s theory prevails, the latter\u2019s claim would still fail under the terms of the BIT and the facts on record.\n\n**b. Does the Obligation \u201cTo Do What is Necessary\u201d to Protect the Claimant\u2019s Investments Provide Additional Protection to the Claimant?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nEven assuming that the BIT\u2019s MFN clause allowed the Claimant to import the obligation to \u201cdo what is necessary so that the exercise of the right so recognized is not impaired either in law or in fact\u201d contained at Article 3 of the Costa Rica-France BIT,1191 the Tribunal does not find that it provides additional protection in the present case.\n\nCosta-Rica-France BIT, Article 3, Exh. **CL-0005**.\n\n749.\n\nThe full text of Article 3 of the France-Costa Rica BIT provides as follows:\n\nCada una de las Partes contratantes, por medio de su legislaci\u00f3n, se compromete a garantizar en su territorio y en sus zonas mar\u00edtimas un tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios del Derecho Internacional, para las inversiones de los nacionales y sociedades de la otra Parte y a hacer lo necesario para que el ejercicio del derecho as\u00ed reconocido no se vea obstaculizado ni en derecho ni de hecho.1192\n\nCosta Rica-France BIT, Article 3, Exh. **CL-0005**.\n\n750.\n\nIt is clear from the text of the provision that the obligation to do what is necessary is tied to the FET obligation. It is a corollary to that obligation to ensure that \u201cthe exercise of the right so recognized [*i.e.*, the right to FET] is not impaired either in law or in fact.\u201d In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this does not provide the Claimant further rights, nor does it impose any additional obligations on the Respondent, beyond the FET standard. As the Tribunal has already discussed, there is nothing further for the Tribunal to address in this respect.\n\n**c. Did the Respondent Breach the Umbrella Clauses Imported Through the MFN Clause?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n751.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the BIT\u2019s MFN clause allows it to import the umbrella clauses contained in Costa Rica\u2019s BITs with Taiwan and Korea, which provide as follows:\n\nEither Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.1193\n\n[...] Each Contracting Party shall comply with any obligation assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.1194\n\nCosta Rica-Korea BIT, Article 10(3), Exh. **CL-0001**.\n\nCosta Rica-Taiwan BIT, Article 3(2), Exh. **CL-0002**.\n\n752.\n\nOn the basis of these imported clauses, the Claimant argues that the Respondent breached its obligation, assumed through the grant of the Concession(s), to allow the Claimant to exploit the Crucitas mine.\n\n753.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow this argument. For an obligation to be protected under the umbrella clause, it must be valid under domestic law.1195 As discussed above, both the 2002 and the 2008 Concessions were granted in violation of Costa Rican law. There was thus no valid obligation under domestic law that could be complied with.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004, \u00b6 126, Exh. **RL-0028**; *Burlington Resources,* \u00b6 214, Exh. **CL-0023**; *Micula,* \u00b6 418, Exh. **CL-0060**.\n\n754.\n\nThe Tribunal thus dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claim based on the BIT\u2019s MFN clause.\n\n**G. D****oes the Environmental Exception in Section** **III(1)** **of Annex** **I** **of the** **BIT Exempt the Respondent from Liability?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n755.\n\nA majority of the Tribunal has found that the Respondent breached its FET obligation through the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and, as an ancillary act, the 2012 MINAET Resolution (to the extent that it implemented that Ban), which had the effect of depriving Industrias Infinito of the opportunity to apply for a new exploitation concession.1196\n\n*See* Section VI.C *supra.*\n\n756.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has found that the Claimant has not established that this breach caused a quantifiable harm, it must address the Respondent\u2019s argument that the environmental exception in Section III(1) of Annex I of the BIT exempts Costa Rica from liability.\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n757.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, as a result of Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT, it cannot be held liable for the challenged measures.1197 Annex I, Section III(1) provides as follows:\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.1198\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 568; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 760.\n\nBIT, Annex I, Section III(1), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n758.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Section III(1) provides for an environmental exception whose purpose is to \u201cgrant some margin of discretion, as well as some level of protection from liability, to the States Parties to enable them to enact, maintain and enforce measures to protect the environment and thereby advance the public good.\u201d1199\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 581.\n\n759.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the environmental exception applies to measures that (i) are otherwise consistent with the BIT, and (ii) that the host State \u201cconsiders appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.\u201d1200\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 573.\n\n760.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s contentions, it is not necessary for both the underlying environmental measures and the measures adopted to enforce or maintain them to be \u201cotherwise consistent\u201d with the BIT.1201 If Section III(1) only permitted Costa Rica to enact measures that are \u201cotherwise consistent\u2019 with the BIT, as the Claimant argues, the environmental exception could only apply where all the relevant measures are consistent with the BIT. In other words, it would only apply in situations where the host State\u2019s liability is not at stake, that is, where \u201cthere is no need for any exemption from liability.\u201d1202 The Claimant\u2019s interpretation would thus establish a mechanism that would never be triggered, and would be inconsistent with the clause\u2019s substantive purpose.1203\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 576.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 579; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 765.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 579-583.\n\n761.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent submits that \u201cthe term \u2018measure\u2019 refers to the ***underlying*** measure that is safeguarding the environment, rather than to a subsequent measure that maintains or enforces such underlying measure.\u201d1204 The decision in *Al Tamim,* which involved an environmental clause identical to Section III(1),1205 confirms its interpretation.1206 Finally, the Respondent argues that its interpretation of Section III(1) ensures that the environmental exception is effective and serves its purpose.1207\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 576 (emphasis in original).\n\nUnited States-Oman Free Trade Agreement, 1 January 2009 (\u201c**US-Oman FTA**\u201d), Article 10.10, Exh. **CL-0111**, states: \u201cNothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.\u201d\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 585, citing *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v.

Merits, \u00b6 763.\n\n762.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the clause applies in the present case, with the result that the Respondent is exempted from liability,1208 because all of the challenged measures - with exception of the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision - were adopted to maintain and/or enforce measures aiming at protecting the environment from possible negative effects of open-pit mining.1209\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 604.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 588.\n\n763.\n\nFurther, the underlying measures (namely, the (i) the 2002 Moratorium; (ii) the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision; (iii) Resolution R-613-2007-MINAE which rendered the 2002 Concession null and void; (iv) the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision; and (v) the 2010 Executive Moratoria) should be deemed to be consistent with the BIT because the Claimant did not challenge them, and because they pre-date the cut-off date under the limitations provision in Article XII(3)(c).1210\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 588.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n764.\n\nThe Claimant denies that Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT relieves the Respondent form liability. The Claimant essentially argues that (i) the Respondent is mischaracterizing Section III(1), which is not an exemption clause; (ii) Costa Rican authorities and the Supreme Court had confirmed that the Crucitas Project complied with Costa Rican environmental policy; and (iii) there is no evidence that Costa Rica adopted the contested measures on environmental grounds.1211\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 703.\n\n765.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits that Section III(1) is not an \u201cenvironmental exception\u201d under which a host State would be exempt of liability if it adopted the challenged measures to enforce environmentally motivated measures.1212 According to the Claimant, Section III(1) is \u201climited to confirming environmental regulatory authority where that authority does not override the substantive provisions of the BIT.\u201d1213 Simply put, Section III(1) merely acknowledges the State\u2019s sovereign right to regulate on environmental matters and cannot be used to \u201coverride the substantive obligations of the BIT and exempt otherwise infringing measures [...].\u201d1214\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 705.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 706.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 705, 710.\n\n766.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this interpretation is confirmed by the literal meaning of Section III(1), which refers expressly to \u201cany measure otherwise consistent with this Agreement.\u201d1215 For the Claimant, the reference to \u201cany measure\u201d includes the \u201cunderlying\u201d measure that is adopted by a State, as well as any subsequent measure that maintains or enforces the \u201cunderlying\u201d measure. There is thus no basis to distinguish between the underlying environmental measures and the measures adopted by the host State to enforce or maintain the former.1216 If Costa Rica\u2019s interpretation were correct, it would \u201cprovide a back door for the Government to avoid its obligations under the BIT by framing any measure in terms of maintaining or enforcing pre-existing or underlying measures, which could not be challenged owing to the three-year limitation.\u201d1217\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 705.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 709.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 709.\n\n767.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the *Al Tamimi* case on which the Respondent relies is irrelevant because the measures at issue in that case did not breach the applicable BIT.1218\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 707.\n\n768.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is estopped from invoking Section III(1) since its own authorities - SETENA, SINAC and the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court - have confirmed that the Crucitas Project was environmentally viable.1219 Indeed, the Costa Rican Government defended the Crucitas Project\u2019s environmental viability before the Costa Rican courts.1220 Relying on *Metalclad,* the Claimant argues that the Respondent cannot ignore its own Government\u2019s conduct, and that \u201cwhere the state has demonstrated that it considers the project at issue to be sensitive to environmental concerns,\u201d provisions such as Section III(1) do not apply.1221\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 711.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 712.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 714, citing *Metalclad,* \u00b6 98, Exh. **CL-0058**.\n\n769.\n\nThird, the Claimant argues that the challenged measures have no environmental purpose and thus do not engage Section III(1).1222 The Claimant stresses that the man measure it challenges is the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which merely engaged in a technical analysis of the 2010 TCA Decision in light of Costa Rican administrative law. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision has thus no \u201csound environmental purpose.\u201d1223 Similarly, the 2012 MINAET Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Ban \u201cwere not motivated by *bona fide* environmental concerns.\u201d1224 More precisely, the Claimant argues that (i) the 2012 MINAET Resolution was merely implementing a judgment rendered on administrative grounds and thus cannot be characterized as an environmental measure;1225 and (ii) several factors show that the 2011 Legislative Ban was issued for political reasons unrelated to environmental concerns.1226 This is confirmed by the fact that Costa Rica has not taken adequate measures to prevent illegal mining and environmental damage caused by that mining on the Project site, or to police or remediate that damage.1227\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 716-717.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 717-719.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 720.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 721.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 720.\n\nC-Reply Merits, \u00b6 720.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a. Does Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT Provide for an Exception to Liability?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n770.\n\nAnnex I, Section III(1) of the BIT provides:\n\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.1228\n\nBIT, Annex I, Section III(1), Exh. **C-0001**.\n\n771.\n\nAccording to the general rule of interpretation enshrined in Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal must interpret the Treaty\u2019s provisions in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context and in light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose.\n\n772.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, unlike other provisions on environmental protection in other investment treaties,1229 Annex I, Section III(1) of the Costa Rica-Canada BIT contains the wording \u201cany measure otherwise consistent with this Agreement.\u201d In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this wording makes it clear that measures meant \u201cto ensure that investment activity [...] is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns\u201d must also be consistent with the investment protections set forth in the BIT.\n\n*See e.g.,* Jordan-Singapore BIT (2004); Japan-Singapore New Age Economic Partnership (2003), India-Singapore CECA (2005), Japan-Malaysia Economic Partnership (2005); Korea-Singapore FTA (2005).\n\n773.\n\nCommentators agree that provisions with such wording \u201ccannot [...] be used to override mandatory treaty obligations,\u201d1230 and that the \u201crequirement that environmental measures be \u2018otherwise consistent\u2019 with the investment treaty [...] undermines the effectiveness of that shield.\u201d1231 One commentator opines that the scope of these provisions is \u201cextremely limited,\u201d and that, despite the fact that most of them are entitled \u201cgeneral exceptions,\u201d \u201cthey do not really do much to narrow States\u2019 potential liability [...]. Rather, they merely recognize and affirm the State\u2019s sovereign right to regulate [...].\u201d1232 For instance, this author submits that these \u201cgeneral provisions [...] have no impact whatsoever on the expropriation provision, which does not prohibit a State from enacting regulations that effectively expropriate investors\u2019 property, but demands compensation in return.\u201d1233\n\nT.

Niki\u00e8ma, *Best Practices: Indirect Expropriation* (Winnipeg: International Institute for Sustainable Development, 2012), p. 9, Exh. **CL-0190**.\n\n774.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties refer to *Al Tamimi,* an arbitration brought under the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement. The tribunal in that case considered the treaty\u2019s provisions recognizing the importance of environmental measures as the context for interpreting the State Parties\u2019 obligations, and noted that the States enjoyed a \u201cmargin of discretion\u201d in relation to the enforcement of their environmental laws.1234 There is no basis to conclude, however, that the tribunal considered that the treaty\u2019s references to environmental measures suggested there should be greater deference in matters relating to the environment than the deference due generally to States in relation to their domestic regulatory affairs.1235 Notably, the *Al Tamimi* tribunal also observed that \u201ceven an express provision such as Article 10.10 will not protect a State from liability for measures that are carried out in bad faith, or in violation of the expected standards of basic fairness or due process.\u201d1236\n\nAl Tamimi, \u00b6 389, Exh. **RL-0104.**\n\n*Al Tamimi,* \u00b6 389, Exh. **RL-0104** (referring in this respect to the well-established principle that investment treaty tribunals \u201cdo not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making\u201d).\n\n*Al Tamimi,* \u00b6 445, Exh. **RL-0104**.\n\n775.\n\nFinally, Costa Rica contends that the words \u201cotherwise consistent with this Agreement\u2019 in Annex I, Section III(1) do not apply to the measures that Infinito challenges because they merely \u201cmaintain or enforce\u201d pre-existing measures, and that Infinito is not challenging and is not permitted to challenge those pre-existing measures because of the three-year limitation period.1237 It argues that the phrase \u201cotherwise consistent\u2019 refers to the word \u201cmeasure,\u201d and the context shows that the term \u201cmeasure\u201d refers to the underlying measure that is safeguarding the environment, rather than to a subsequent measure that maintains or enforces such underlying measure.1238\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 572-577, 588; R-Rej. Merits, \u00b6 761.\n\nR-CM Merits, \u00b6 576.\n\n776.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow this interpretation. The terms \u201cotherwise consistent with this Agreement\u201d also apply to measures that are \u201cmaintain[ed]\u201d or \u201cenforc[ed],\u201d not only to measures that are \u201cadopted.\u201d Consequently, in accordance with its ordinary meaning, Annex I, Section III(1) does not exempt an environmental measure from the substantive provisions of the BIT, regardless of whether that measure is a new measure that is \u201cadopted\u201d or whether it is a measure that \u201cmaintains\u201d or \u201cenforces\u201d an earlier measure.\n\n777.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, interpreted in accordance with the VCLT, Annex I, Section III(1) is not a carve-out from the BIT\u2019s protections, but rather a reaffirmation of the State\u2019s right to regulate.\n\n778.\n\nThe Respondent argues however that, unless it is interpreted as exempting the Respondent from liability for the adoption of environmental measures, Annex I, Section III(1) is deprived of its *effet utile.* The Tribunal cannot agree. It understands that the purpose of this provision is to protect the Contracting State\u2019s legitimate regulatory space and to reserve a margin of discretion in environmental matters.1239 Provisions like Annex I, Section III(1) must be viewed as acknowledging and reminding interpreters that these two objectives - environment and investment protection - should, if possible, be reconciled so that they are mutually supportive and reinforcing.1240 In other words, this provision reaffirms the State\u2019s right to regulate.\n\n*See Clayton &* *Bilcon,* \u00b6 597, Exh. **CL-0172** (confirming, notwithstanding the identical reference in NAFTA, Chapter 11, that \u201c[t]he mere fact that environmental regulation is involved does not make investor protection inapplicable\u201d).\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Separate Opinion by Dr. Bryan Schwartz, Concurring Except with Respect to Performance Requirements, in the Partial Award of the Tribunal, 12 November 2000, \u00b6 118 (\u201cI view Article 1114 as acknowledging and reminding interpreters of Chapter 11 (Investment) that the parties take both the environment and open trade very seriously and that means should be found to reconcile these two objectives and, if possible, to make them mutually supportive\u201d).\n\n779.\n\n*Al Tamimi* supports this interpretation. In that case, the tribunal found that fines issued by the government for repeated and serious breaches of environmental regulations were issued in furtherance of its role \u201cto regulate and supervise compliance with Oman\u2019s environmental laws.\u201d1241 In reaching this conclusion, the tribunal relied on a provision of the U.S.-Oman FTA with the exact language contained in Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT.1242 Significantly, the measures at issue did not breach the substantive protections in the relevant treaty.1243 While this provision confirmed Oman\u2019s right to sanction violations of its environmental laws in a manner that did not otherwise breach its obligations under the treaty, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it would have operated as a defense had the tribunal found that those measures breached the treaty.\n\n*Al Tamimi,* \u00b6 340, Exh. **RL-0104**.\n\n*Al Tamimi,* \u00b6 445, Exh. **RL-0104**, citing Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Sultanate of Oman on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area, Article 10.10, Exh. **CL-0111**.\n\n*Al Tamimi,* \u00b6\u00b6 376, 390, 430-431, 445-447, 467, Exh. **RL-0104**.\n\n780.\n\nConversely, the Respondent\u2019s argument that Annex I, Section III(1) of the BIT provides a defense to substantive breaches of the BIT would render meaningless the \u201cotherwise consistent with this Agreement\u201d language. Other exceptions and exemptions contained in Section III are not limited by similar language. For example, Section III(3) contains an unlimited exemption enabling the Contracting Parties to adopt or maintain \u201creasonable measures for prudential reasons\u201d related to financial market protection and regulation. Similarly, Section III(4) exempts \u201cinvestments in cultural industries\u201d from the provisions of the BIT. Since Section III(1) does contain the \u201cotherwise consistent\u201d\u2019 language, it cannot be construed as an exception or exemption from the BIT protections for environmental measures.\n\n781.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Annex I, Section III(1) of the Costa Rica-Canada BIT does not exempt the Respondent from liability for breaches of the substantive protections granted by the BIT. Accordingly, it cannot exempt the Respondent for its breaches of its FET obligation.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. T****he Parties\u2019 Costs**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1.

Accordingly, ICSID's financial records reflect that adding the fourth advance payment of USD 200,000.00, d uring the merits phase the Claimant p rovided advance payments of USD 449,990.00, for a total of advance payments in this proceeding of USD 799,970.00.\n\nThat total seems to have a mathematical error.

R-Cost Merits, \u00b6 6.\n\nThis amount refers to the advance payments made to ICSID to cover ICSID administrative costs, and Tribunal fees and expenses. *See* R-Costs Merits, \u00b6 3(i). The Tribunal observes that this amount does not reflect the fourth advance payment requested from the Parties on 9 September 2020 and paid by the Respondent on 9 October 2020, after the Statements of Costs were filed. *See* ICSID's communication of 19 October 2020. Accordingly, ICSID's financial records reflect that adding the fourth advance payment of USD 199,975.00, during the merits phase the Respondent provided advance payments of USD 449,955.00, for a total of advance payments in this proceeding of USD 799,913.00. (In addition, the Respondent credited to the case fund in this proceeding an additional amount of USD 49,308.15 in transfers from remanent funds in other concluded proceedings, as reflected in ICSID's letter to the Parties dated 7 December 2017).\n\n790.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to (i) \u201corder the Claimant to pay to Costa Rica **USD 3,014,267.58** to cover the Costs and Expenses that Costa Rica has incurred in this proceeding, plus compound interest on those amounts before and after the issuance of the award and until the date of payment, calculated on the basis of a reasonable commercial rate determined by the Tribunal;\u201d1262 and (ii) \u201corder the Claimant to pay any additional Costs and Expenses that Costa Rica may reasonably incur before the Tribunal renders its award, plus interest.\u201d1263\n\nR-Costs Merits, \u00b6 10.\n\nR-Costs Merits, \u00b6 11.\n\n**B. T****he Costs of the Proceeding**\n--------------------------------------\n\n791.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Description** | **Amount (USD)** |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 Fees and Expenses |  |\n| Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler | $ 364,816.22 |\n| Prof. Bernard Hanotiau | $ 242,789.95 |\n| Prof. Brigitte Stern | $ 236,420.02 |\n| Assistant\u2019s Fees and Expenses | $ 191,862.54 |\n| ICSID\u2019s Administrative Fees | $ 264,000.00 |\n| Direct Expenses | $ 224,302.64 |\n| **total** | **$ 1,524,191.37** |\n\n792.\n\nThese costs (\u201c**Costs of the Proceeding**\u201d) have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties.1264 The expended portion of each Party\u2019s advances to cover the above costs of the arbitration was: USD 762,695.69 (for the Claimant) and USD 761,495.69 (for the Respondent).1265\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a Final Financial Statement of the case fund. The remaining balance shall be reimbursed to the Parties based on the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\nThe small difference in the disbursements from the case fund allocated to each Party relates to the Parties' agreement that the costs associated with the conduct of the examination of Mr. Erich Rauguth at the Hearing on the Merits via videoconference would be covered by the Claimant. *See* the Parties' emails of 11 July 2019.\n\n**C. A****nalysis**\n-------------------\n\n793.\n\nEach Party seeks an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration, including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings.\n\n794.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n795.\n\nThe Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration between the Parties, including legal fees and expenses, as it deems appropriate. The Parties have not disputed the Tribunal\u2019s discretion, and in fact, the Respondent has explicitly recognized it.1266\n\nR-Costs Merits, \u00b6 2; R-Cost Jur., \u00b6 2.\n\n796.\n\nTwo approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals in awarding costs. The first consists in apportioning ICSID costs in equal shares and ruling that each party shall bear its own costs. The second applies the principle \u201ccosts follow the event,\u201d such that the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party, or that the parties share in the costs proportionately to their success or failure.\n\n797.\n\nIn reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has considered the Parties\u2019 arguments as well as the circumstances of this case, including the Parties\u2019 conduct in pursuing their claims and defenses. The Tribunal observes that the Claimant has prevailed on jurisdiction and the Respondent has largely but not entirely succeeded on the merits. It also notes that the factual and legal issues to which this dispute gave rise were highly complex and that it can certainly not be deemed illegitimate or frivolous for the Claimant to have brought this arbitration. Its claims gave rise to difficult questions, the outcome of which could not easily be predicted at the time of initiating these proceedings. It must also be observed that both Parties and their counsel have conducted these proceedings in a professional, cooperative, and efficient manner.\n\n798.\n\nWeighing all these elements, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, finds it fair that the Costs of the Proceeding shall be shared equally between the Parties,1267 and that each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs.\n\nExcept for the Parties' own agreement with respect to the costs of the videoconference of Mr. Rauguth, which are to be borne by the Claimant as agreed and already reflected in the distribution of disbursements in the case fund. *Supra* \u00b6 792, and fn.1265.\n\n**VIII.

DECLARES that it has jurisdiction over the claims before it and that, with the exception noted in paragraph (b) below, the claims are admissible;\n\nb. DECLARES that the claim arising from the reinitiation in 2019 of the TCA damages proceeding is premature and thus inadmissible at the present stage;\n\nc. DECLARES that, by enacting the 2011 Legislative Mining Ban and implementing it through the 2012 MINAET Resolution, the Respondent has breached its obligation under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT to accord to the Claimant\u2019s investments fair and equitable treatment;\n\nd. DETERMINES that it can award no damages from this breach;\n\ne. ORDERS that each Party bear 50% of the Costs of the Proceeding and its own legal fees and other costs;\n\nf. DISMISSES all remaining claims and requests for relief."}]}
