After summarizing the Parties' positions in Section II, the Tribunal provides the reasons for its bifurcation decision in Section III. The Tribunal's decision is set out in Section IV and the new procedural timetable is set out in Annex A.\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 in this claim under the United Kingdom-Sri Lanka bilateral investment treaty (\"BIT\"), including a partial procedural schedule (\"Annex A\").\n\n3.\n\nPer Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent on December 8, 2017 filed its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections Pursuant to Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, accompanied by Exhibits R-0001 through R-0011 and Legal Authorities RL-0001 through RL-0049. This contained a request for bifurcation of preliminary objections on jurisdiction (the \"Respondent's Bifurcation Request\").\n\n4.\n\nOn December 29, 2017, the Claimants filed their Objections to the Respondent's Request to Bifurcate (the \"Claimants' Bifurcation Opposition\") together with a proposed schedule and two legal authorities.1\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., and MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat \u00f3 Kft. v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 (Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, June 13, 2013); and *United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24 (Procedural Order No. 2, June 17, 2015).\n\n5.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Respondent filed its Response to the Claimants\u2019 Objection to the Respondent\u2019s Request to Bifurcate (the \"Respondent\u2019s Bifurcation Response\") together with one legal authority.2\n\n*Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Ltd v. Republic of India,* PCA, Case No.2016-2017 (Procedural Order No. 4, April 19, 2017) *(\"Cairn v. India\").*\n\n6.\n\nOn January 12, 2018, the Claimants applied to the Tribunal for leave to reply to Respondent\u2019s Bifurcation Response, which was granted. The Claimants filed their submission on January 17, 2018 (the \"Claimants\u2019 Bifurcation Reply\").\n\n7.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, the Secretariat relayed the following communication from the Tribunal to the Parties:\n\nUpon review of the Parties\u2019 submissions of December 8 and 29, 2017 and January 10 and 17, 2018, the Tribunal has determined that bifurcation of jurisdiction is appropriate, for reasons to be outlined in an order to follow.\n\nBased on the Parties' agreement that the merits issues are not unduly complex, with relatively complex submissions and expert testimony to come only at the quantum phase, we consider that it would be most efficient to bifurcate the proceedings to hear both jurisdiction and merits together first before moving to a quantum stage, if necessary. The Tribunal will attempt to find earlier hearing dates for the joint jurisdiction and merits phase, or, if necessary, hold the hearing on days during the reserved week in October 2018.\n\nBefore proceeding in this fashion, we would appreciate the Parties' views on the suggested scope of bifurcation and the number of days likely necessary to hear jurisdiction and merits together. Please provide your views (email is fine) by February 1, 2018.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of February 1, 2018, the Claimants agreed with the Tribunal\u2019s proposed bifurcation of a joint jurisdictional and merits phase, followed by a quantum phase (if required). The Claimants expressed the view that \"the proposed jurisdiction and merits hearing could be accommodated within two days of sitting time, to be scheduled as early as possible subject to availability\", and they attached an indicative procedural calendar with a possible hearing after 15 July 2018. They also requested that the Tribunal reserve a provisional hearing date for quantum.\n\n9.\n\nAlso on February 1, 2018, the Respondent supported the Tribunal\u2019s proposed bifurcation, and suggested a two-and-one-half day hearing with one-half day in reserve. The Respondent expressed the \"view and understanding\" that bifurcation would mean that all legal issues relating to causation and quantum, the quantum and planning expert issues, related disclosure issues, and related factual evidence would not be included in the bifurcated first phase. They added:\n\nThere is one further issue which would need to be hived off to any future quantum phase, being the question of whether adequate compensation was provided in the context of the Claimant\u2019s [sic] claim for alleged expropriation under Article 5(1): see \u00a7165 of the Claimant\u2019s [sic] Memorial. This necessarily raises issues that go to quantum. However, and to clarify further and for the avoidance of doubt, the Claimants argue that adequate compensation is a precondition to any expropriation being lawful. The Respondent disagrees given the terms of the BIT and this legal issue can be dealt with in this jurisdiction/liability phase.\n\n10.\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the Claimants wrote that they \"strongly oppose\" the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the bifurcated jurisdiction/merits phase not include the question of the adequacy of the compensation paid by the Respondent on the taking of the Claimants\u2019 investments. In their view:\n\n[t]he question of whether compensation offered or paid to the Claimants was *\"adequate\"* within the meaning of Article 5(1) is not the same as the question of the Claimants\u2019 rightful compensation under the customary standard of full reparation established in the *Chorzow Factory* case [footnote omitted]. The former... would entail hearing from a Sri Lankan land valuation expert as to the bare value of the Montrose Land at the time at which it was taken. The latter - comprising evidence as to the future value of the Claimants\u2019 planned Hotel Project [footnote omitted] - would then be heard in the quantum phase (if required) when determining the Claimants\u2019 ultimate losses.\n\nIf the Respondent\u2019s suggestion is adopted, say the Claimants, \"it will leave the Tribunal unable to determine liability in its decision on jurisdiction and merits since it will not be able to rule definitively on any of the treaty breaches advanced in the Memorial.\"\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated February 5, 2018, the Respondent objected that the Claimants were attempting \"to amend their case in correspondence in order to seek to have the opportunity to put in new land surveyor expert evidence that they have never advanced in respect of a case they have never advanced.\" The Respondents emphasize that the Claimants have not put forward any expert evidence supporting a case for the value of the bare land before the alleged expropriation; in claiming in their Memorial that the land was worth approximately US$21 million, the basis is the DCF computation of their alleged loss of opportunity to develop a hotel on the land. The Respondent also argues that \"it is well-established that compensation does not go to lawfulness\" of expropriation.\n\n12.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, the Secretariat relayed the following communication from the Tribunal to the Parties:\n\nThe Tribunal notes the differing, and apparently irreconcilable, views of the parties as to whether the issue of the lawfulness of the alleged expropriation of the Montrose Land is properly and fully a liability/merits issue or a quantum issue. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal confirms its decision to bifurcate only jurisdiction issues for a preliminary phase, for reasons to follow in a formal decision.\n\nThe Tribunal proposes to conduct the hearing on **22-24 August 2018** (two days, with a half day in reserve). If the parties can agree on this August date, the Tribunal requests counsel to attempt to agree a balanced procedural timetable leading up to the hearing. If the parties cannot agree on the 22-24 August hearing date, the Tribunal will calendar the jurisdiction hearing for the reserved days of **17-19 October 2018** (two days, with a half day in reserve), and requests counsel to attempt to agree the procedural timetable.\n\nThe parties are to revert by **13 February 2018**. The Tribunal will schedule the merits and quantum hearing after the jurisdiction schedule is settled.\n\n13.\n\nOn February 13, 2018, the Parties reported to the Tribunal that the Respondent\u2019s counsel are unavailable for the Tribunal\u2019s proposed August 2018 hearing dates, and the Claimants consequently have \"reluctantly and under protest\" agreed to the October 1719, 2018 hearing dates. The February 13, 2018 letter attaches the new draft procedural timetable agreed by the Parties.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS ON BIFURCATION OF JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Bifurcation Request**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn its December 8, 2017 submission, the Respondent raises the following jurisdictional objections:\n\n(i) The Claimants are not \"investors\" under the BIT and so they lack standing to bring a claim under BIT Article 8(2) or, in the alternative, BIT Article 8(1);\n\n(ii) There is no \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; and/or\n\n(iii) The Claimants\u2019 claim does not \"directly arise\" out of any alleged \"investment\" pursuant to ICSID Convention Article 25.3\n\nBifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 3; 39 *et seq.*\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent provides detailed argument on each of these objections and concludes by submitting that the Claimants\u2019 \"claims should be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds and that this should be dealt with as a preliminary issue and/or by way of formal stay of the proceeding on the merits.\"4\n\nBifurcation Request, \u00b6 123.\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Bifurcation Opposition**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants oppose the Respondent's bifurcation request, arguing that, although appearing to request bifurcation, the Respondent \"has not advanced any positive case for bifurcation in the Preliminary Objections, nor has it referred to any of the factors identified in the relevant ICSID case-law which would militate in favor of bifurcation.\"5 The Claimants underscore that \"[w]hilst the decision to bifurcate proceedings under Rule 41(4) is a matter of discretion\u2026a number of considerations applicable to the exercise of discretion have been identified by prior ICSID tribunals\", the \"touchstone of analysis is procedural efficiency.\"6\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 1- 2.\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\n17.\n\nAnalyzing the Respondent's preliminary objections using the bifurcation factors identified in ICSID case law, the Claimants submit:\n\n(i) The Respondent's request for bifurcation is not substantial as the preliminary objections are likely to fail;7\n\n(ii) The Bifurcation Request \"is highly unlikely to lead to a reduction in the proceedings [as] none of the jurisdictional objections made appears particularly meritorious\"; even if they succeeded, given the parties already considered that a five-day hearing would suffice for both jurisdiction and merits, there would only be a \"very limited amount of time and expenditure\" saved, \"which would likely be matched or exceeded by the additional time and cost taken in arranging and arguing a separate jurisdictional phase of the proceeding.\"8\n\n(iii) \"Whilst the issues identified by the Respondent in the Preliminary Objections are not overly intertwined with the merits\u2026none of the points\u2026, if upheld by the Tribunal, would resolve the entire dispute\u2026. This fundamental nature of Respondent's objections also increases the substantial risk that a separate jurisdictional phase, even if partially successful for the Respondent, would still lead to a merits phase with no narrowing of the issues.\"9\n\n(iv) \"The strongest factor militating against bifurcation, however, is the complete lack of proportionality of the delay to the proceedings. According to the Claimants, \"[t]he merits phase of the proceedings will be uncomplicated\", which is the reason that the \"Tribunal set down the timetable in Annex A of PO1 of just over 15 months from the filing of the Memorial to the final hearing. Granting the Request would disrupt this considerably\u2026. There would also be the substantial additional cost of both party legal costs and Tribunal expenses for a second oral hearing and the production of two partial awards rather than a single final award.\" The Claimants posit that \"the true motivation for seeking a preliminary determination of the insubstantial jurisdictional objections is simply to drag the proceedings out\u2026.\"10\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.\n\n18.\n\nConcluding, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal should dismiss the Bifurcation Request and adopt the Claimants' proposed modified procedural timetable that would permit the Tribunal still to hold \u2018a single final hearing\" during the October 2018 scheduled dates.11\n\nBifurcation Opposition, \u00b6\u00b6 36-38.\n\n**C. THE RESPONDENT'S BIFURCATION RESPONSE**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nIn its Bifurcation Response, the Respondent counters the Claimants' argument that it did not advance a specific bifurcation request or justify its proposal by explaining that it \"did not understand that it was required to do so at the time of filing its Preliminary Objections\" as the \"procedural steps leading to a hearing on bifurcation have already been set out in the Tribunal's Flow Chart\u2026.\"12 Moreover, \"[i]f the Claimants thought otherwise, they could have promptly canvassed the point\u2026rather than waiting 21 days to file their Objection[\u2026]\"13 The Respondent further submits that the Flow Chart needed only be updated to specify that a 1.5 day jurisdictional hearing would be required as well as a jurisdictional document disclosure phase.14\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 4.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 5.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with Claimants' bifurcation \"test\" \u2013 that the \"merits of the jurisdictional objections advanced \u2026 are not prima facie of substance and are likely to fail\" \u2013 and \"the Claimants' asserted assessment of the merits.\"15 Instead, the Respondent submits that to oppose bifurcation:\n\n[t]he Claimants would have to argue that the jurisdictional objections are on their face obviously frivolous such that the Respondent has not put forward serious arguments. Beyond such circumstances, which is obviously not the case, it is singularly inappropriate for the Claimants to seek to argue the merits in this way and to invite the Tribunal to prejudge the merits of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.16\n\nThe Respondent then emphasizes several alleged deficiencies in the Claimants' substantive arguments regarding the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.17\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (citing *Cairn v. India*).\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n21.\n\nContrary to the Claimants' assertions, the Respondent contends that \"[i]f the Respondent is successful on its jurisdictional objections then there will have been considerable time and costs saving\" as the hearing will be shorter, expert evidence will not be addressed, witness evidence will be curtailed and the need for document disclosure will be less.18 The Respondent also disputes the Claimants' assertion that \"the Respondent has to succeed on several of its jurisdiction arguments in order to knock out both Claimants.\"19\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 15.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 19.\n\n22.\n\nIn the event the Tribunal denies bifurcation, the Respondent objects to the Claimants' proposed timetable. First, the Respondent submits that it would not be able to produce its Counter-Memorial on the Merits with supporting evidence by January 26, 2018. Second, the Respondent argues that the deadline for the Respondent's Rejoinder is unfair as lead counsel will be away in August 2018 and there would have been only ten weeks from the proposed document production deadline (as compared to the Claimants' having four months to prepare a Reply). Consequently, the Respondent proposes two alternative timetables in the event its Preliminary Objections are not bifurcated.20\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6\u00b6 22-33.\n\n**D. THE CLAIMANTS' BIFURCATION REPLY**\n---------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn their Bifurcation Reply, the Claimants underscore that \"as the Respondent ultimately accepts, the case for bifurcation is not made out.\" The Claimants then stress that the \"expeditious resolution of all issues in dispute as a combined jurisdiction and merits hearing\u2026 in October 2018\" is in both Parties' interest.21 The Claimants highlight that the Respondent's submissions on bifurcation are premised on the success of its jurisdictional objections and note that a decision to bifurcate cannot be \"premised on the mere fact that preliminary objections have been made.\" Instead, the Claimants assert that \"the analysis must take into account the context of the application.\"\n\nBifurcation Reply, p. 1.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants explain that this case should not be bifurcated as it \"remains a straightforward case by investment arbitration standards\u2026with comparatively modest quantum\"; little evidence on the merits is needed; the Parties agreed a five-day hearing would suffice on both jurisdiction and merits (versus 1.5 days estimated by the Respondent for jurisdiction only); and the additional cost and the delay of an additional phase is not merited.22 After considering the Respondent\u2019s proposed procedural timetable for a non-bifurcated proceeding, the Claimants adjust the proposed deadlines for the document production phase and the time limit for the Claimants\u2019 Reply.23\n\nBifurcation Reply, p. 2.\n\nBifurcation Reply, pp. 2-3.\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n25.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nAny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) provides in relevant part that the Tribunal \"may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute....\"\n\n27.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 positions on bifurcation, and as indicated to the Parties in prior communications, the Tribunal finds that bifurcation of the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections on jurisdiction is warranted on several grounds.\n\n28.\n\nFirst, the Respondent has raised serious jurisdictional objections that, if accepted, could lead to dismissal of the entire case or a substantial part of the case. This will promote procedural efficiency.\n\n29.\n\nSecond, the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections involve limited factual and legal issues, which could be fully developed with a limited further document production stage and limited witnesses. Even the Claimants recognize that \"the Preliminary Objections are not overly intertwined with the merits.\"24 The merits are - subject to the Parties' differing and apparently irreconcilable views as to whether the issue of the lawfulness of the alleged expropriation of the Montrose Land is properly and fully a liability/merits issue or a quantum issue - relatively straightforward, because it is undisputed that the Respondent took the Montrose Land and paid the original purchase price.\n\nClaimants\u2019 December 29, 2017 letter, para. 29.\n\n30.\n\nThird, it is quantum that will be the most complicated and expensive stage, as the Claimants are seeking lost future profits exceeding US$20 million from the hotel project contemplated for the Montrose Land. If the quantum phase is necessary, there will be complex submissions and a host of fact and expert witness testimony. It would be a waste of significant time and funds for the Parties to address quantum in the first phase should the Tribunal decide in the Respondent's favor in whole or substantial part on jurisdiction.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n31.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal orders as follows:\n\na. the Respondent's request to bifurcate preliminary objections on jurisdiction is granted; and\n\nb. the procedural timetable for the bifurcated first phase is as set out in Annex A."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2020-03-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**BIT**\" or the \"**UK-Sri Lanka BIT**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Mr Raymond Charles Eyre (\"**Mr Eyre**\"), a British national, and Montrose Developments (Private) Limited (\"**Montrose**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Sri Lanka (together, the \"**Claimants**\"). Mr Eyre has had a long career in international finance, including as Managing Director and Head of Leasing and Capital International Development at Bank of America for 15 years before founding and becoming the Chairman of Montrose Global LLP (\"**Montrose Global**\"), described by the Claimants as \"an alternative asset-based investment and management partnership focused on the leasing and financing of large ticket assets and private equity\".1\n\nClaimants' Memorial (\"**Memorial**\"), para 6.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (\"**Sri Lanka**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a dispute between the Parties arising out of the Claimants' alleged investment in a plot of land on a lake in Sri Lanka (the \"**Montrose Land**\"), which the Claimants allege was to be developed into a hotel complex (the \"**Hotel Project**\"). The Claimants allege that Sri Lanka expropriated the land by dredging along the shoreline and restricting access to the Montrose Land without notice and then failing to pay adequate compensation.\n\n6.\n\nThe subject of this Award is Sri Lanka's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections brought under Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention. For the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal has determined that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and hence dismisses this arbitration, with reasonable costs to be borne by the Claimants.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Request for Arbitration**\n----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 7 July 2016, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from Mr Eyre and Montrose against Sri Lanka (the \"**Request**\") together with an affidavit of Mr Eyre dated 30 June 2016 and Exhibits C-001 through C-009.\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 August 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, supplemented by letter of 27 July 2016, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**B. Tribunal Constitution**\n----------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, whereby the Tribunal would comprise three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Professor Lucy Reed, a US national, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Professor Julian DM Lew QC, a British national, appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Brigitte Stern, a French national, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n11.\n\nOn 6 March 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms Geraldine Fischer, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. The Written and Oral Phases**\n----------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 1 May 2017 by teleconference.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 1 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1. Procedural Order No 1 provides, *inter alia,* that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, the procedural language is English, and the place of proceeding is London, United Kingdom.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No 1, the Claimants filed their Memorial on 11 August 2017 (the \"**Memorial**\"), together with the Witness Statement of Mr Eyre dated 2 August 2017 (the \"**First Eyre Statement**\"), the Witness Statement of Mr Sanjeewa Wijeratne dated 2 August 2017, the Expert Report of Mr KBV Dharmasiri dated 8 August 2007, the Expert Report of Mr Achin Khanna dated 11 August 2017, Exhibits C-010 through C-087 and Legal Authorities CL-001 through CL-123.\n\n15.\n\nOn 8 December 2017, Sri Lanka filed its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections pursuant to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention (the \"**Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections**\") which contained a request that the Tribunal bifurcate and address the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections \"as a preliminary issue and/or by way of formal stay of the proceedings on the merits\" (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Request to Bifurcate**\"), together with Exhibits R-001 through R-011 and Legal Authorities RL-001 through RL-049.\n\n16.\n\nOn 29 December 2017, the Claimants filed their Objections to the Respondent\u2019s Request to Bifurcate with a proposed schedule and two Legal Authorities.\n\n17.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, on 10 January 2018, Sri Lanka filed its Response to the Claimants\u2019 Objection to the Respondent\u2019s Request to Bifurcate together with one Legal Authority.\n\n18.\n\nOn 17 January 2018, further to the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Claimants filed their Observations on the Respondent\u2019s 10 January 2018 Response on the issue of bifurcation.\n\n19.\n\nIn January and February 2018, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties on the proposed scope of bifurcation and possible hearing dates.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2, granting Sri Lanka\u2019s Request to Bifurcate the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections and setting the procedural timetable for the bifurcated first phase.\n\n21.\n\nOn 25 April 2018, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\") together with the Second Witness Statement of Mr Eyre dated 25 April 2018 (the \"**Second Eyre Statement**\"), Exhibits C-088 through C-098 and Legal Authorities CL-124 through CL-176.\n\n22.\n\nIn May 2018, the Parties pursued document production requests. On 30 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 3 addressing the Parties\u2019 contested document production requests.\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 July 2018, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction (the \"**Reply**\") together with the Expert Report of Ms Narissa Chen dated 18 July 2018, Exhibits R-012 through R-022 and Legal Authorities RL-050 through RL-148.\n\n24.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, the Secretary-General moved the Tribunal to stay the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) for non-payment of the required advances. The proceeding was stayed on 1 August 2018. On 9 August 2018, after the Centre received the requested advance from the Respondent, the Tribunal lifted the stay of the proceeding.\n\n25.\n\nOn 13 August 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 request for an extension to file their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction until 7 September 2018.\n\n26.\n\nOn 6 September 2018, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the \"**Rejoinder**\") with Legal Authorities CL-177 through CL-235. The Rejoinder also contained Claimants\u2019 application, under ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1), 26(3) and 27, to exclude three allegedly new jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent in its Reply (the \"**Exclusion Application**\").\n\n27.\n\nOn 18 September 2018, the Respondent opposed the Claimants\u2019 Exclusion Application and filed an application to adduce two new legal authorities and one new exhibit (the \"**New Evidence Application**\"). Sri Lanka also requested disclosure of \"documents containing and/or evidencing any discussion and/or negotiation concerning the terms of the MOU and any alleged developments and/or changes in those terms, subsequent to the signature of that document\" (the \"**Disclosure Application**\"). As discussed below (at paragraphs 80-86), the \"**MOU**\" is an undated document headed \"Memorandum of Understanding between Electro Holiday Resorts and Montrose Global LLP\", which became the focus of substantial dispute between the Parties.\n\n28.\n\nOn 24 September 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 4, denying the Claimants\u2019 Exclusion Application on grounds that the Claimants had requested and received an extension of time to address the allegedly new jurisdictional objections in their Rejoinder. The Tribunal subsequently allowed the Parties to make substantive submissions on the relevant three jurisdictional objections at the 17-19 October 2018 hearing on jurisdiction in London (the \"**Jurisdiction Hearing**\"). The Tribunal also granted the Respondent\u2019s New Evidence Application and invited the Claimants to respond to the Respondent\u2019s Disclosure Application by 27 September 2018.\n\n29.\n\nOn 27 September 2018, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s Disclosure Application and represented that, in any event, they did not have in their possession or control any responsive documents.\n\n30.\n\nOn 28 September 2018, the Tribunal held a meeting by teleconference with the Parties to address the organisation for the Jurisdiction Hearing.\n\n31.\n\nOn 2 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 5 addressing the organisation of the Jurisdiction Hearing and the Respondent\u2019s Disclosure Application. The Tribunal granted the Disclosure Application and directed the Claimants to conduct a further search for \"documents containing and/or evidencing any discussion and/or negotiation concerning the terms of the MOU and any alleged developments and/or changes in those terms, subsequent to the signature of that document\" and then produce those documents immediately or report the results of the search to the Tribunal by 8 October 2018.\n\n32.\n\nOn 10 and 11 October 2018, the Parties exchanged correspondence regarding their positions on the Claimants\u2019 compliance with the further search directed in Procedural Order No 5. On 11 October 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would address the issue at the Jurisdiction Hearing. At the opening of the Jurisdiction Hearing, counsel for the Respondent confirmed that they would address the issues during opening submissions, although Sri Lanka was not seeking an order from the Tribunal at this stage.2\n\nTranscript (\"**Tr**\") Day One 9:10-20.\n\n33.\n\nThe Jurisdiction Hearing proceeded on 17-19 October 2018.\n\n34.\n\nThe following persons were present at the Hearing on Jurisdiction in London:\n\n***Tribunal** :*  \nProfessor Lucy Reed President  \nProfessor Julian DM Lew QC Arbitrator  \nProfessor Brigitte Stern Arbitrator\n\n***ICSID Secretariat:***  \nMs Geraldine R Fischer Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n***For the Claimants:***  \nDr Christopher Harris QC 3 Verulam Buildings  \nDr Cameron Miles 3 Verulam Buildings  \nMr Garreth Wong Bird & Bird  \nMs Rhiannon Price Bird & Bird  \nMr Theo Rees-Bidder Bird & Bird  \nDr Harsha Cabral PC Chambers of Dr Harsha Cabral  \nMr Nishan Premathiratne AAL Chambers of Dr Harsha Cabral  \nMs Marina Litvak Counsel, Montrose  \nMr Raymond Charles Eyre Montrose  \nMr Sanjeewa Wijeratne Witness\n\n***For the Respondent:***  \nMr Ricky Diwan QC Essex Court Chambers  \nMr John Whittaker Clyde & Co LLP  \nMs Grace Asemota Clyde & Co LLP  \nMs Caitriona McCarthy Clyde & Co LLP  \nMs Sophie Morrison Clyde & Co LLP  \nMr Andrew Chan Chee Yin Allen & Gledhill LLP  \nMr Milinda Gunetilleke Attorney General's Department  \nMr Nirmalan Wigneswaran Attorney General's Department  \nMs Anusha Jayatilake Attorney General's Department  \nMr CB Amerasinghe Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation  \n Ms HKKW Ekanayake Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation\n\n***Court Reporter:***  \nMs Diana Burden\n\n***Interpreter:***  \nMr Mohamed Rizvi Rawoof thebigword\n\n***Observer:***  \nMr Geoffrey Shaw Temple Bar Scholar (with Dr Christopher Harris QC).\n\n35.\n\nOn the first day of the Jurisdiction Hearing, counsel presented opening statements. On the first and second days of the Jurisdiction Hearing, the following persons were examined:\n\n***On behalf of the Claimants** :*  \nMr Wijeratne  \nMr Eyre\n\n***On behalf of the Respondent:***  \nMs Chen\n\n36.\n\nOn the second and third day of the Jurisdiction Hearing, counsel presented closing arguments. In response to inquiries from the Tribunal as to the possible outcomes stemming from Sri Lanka's various jurisdictional objections, counsel for the Claimants submitted a demonstrative in the form of a Decision Tree. Counsel for both sides addressed the Decision Tree during their closings. At the close of the Jurisdiction Hearing, the Tribunal requested the Parties to attempt to update and agree on the Decision Tree. The Tribunal also directed the Parties to file post-hearing submissions.\n\n37.\n\nOn 7 December 2018, as directed, the Claimants filed their Post-Hearing Brief and the Respondent filed its Closing Submissions on Jurisdiction.\n\n38.\n\nOn 11 December 2018, the Respondents filed an application to exclude two allegedly new substantive issues in the Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief (the \"**Post-Hearing Exclusion Application**\"). In brief, the alleged new issues were: first, the Claimants\u2019 assertion that under Sri Lankan law no express trust arose from the MOU over the profits from the future Hotel Project; and, second, the Claimants\u2019 alternative case that a constructive trust was created for Mr Eyre in relation to the Montrose shareholding.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter dated 14 December 2018, the Claimants\u2019 counsel reported to the Tribunal that the Parties had not been able to agree a final version of the Decision Tree. The Claimants submitted a copy of the Decision Tree \"in its almost finally agreed form - thereby incorporating a large number of changes proposed by Sri Lanka that the Claimants do not accept\".\n\n40.\n\nBy letter also dated 14 December 2018, Sri Lanka\u2019s counsel confirmed that they had been unable to agree with the Claimants\u2019 counsel on a final version of the Decision Tree, because the Decision Tree \"presents a number of the key issues from the Claimants\u2019 perspective in the body of the flow chart with a number of points raised by the Respondent addressed by way of footnote rather than in the chart itself... and the visual impression created by the Chart reflects the Claimants\u2019 position and not the Respondent\u2019s position\".\n\n41.\n\nOn 21 December 2018, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Exclusion Application. Again in brief, the Claimants argued that, first, the express trust issue had been sufficiently addressed at the Jurisdiction Hearing and, second, any disadvantage to Sri Lanka caused by the late raising of the constructive trust issue could be alleviated by allowing Sri Lanka a supplementary submission.\n\n42.\n\nOn 18 January 2019, Sri Lanka maintained the arguments in support of its Post-Hearing Exclusion Application.\n\n43.\n\nOn 6 February 2019, by Procedural Order No 6, the Tribunal (by majority) granted the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Exclusion Application, finding that the Claimants had failed to provide satisfactory justification for raising two new issues after the Jurisdiction Hearing.\n\n44.\n\nOn 20 February 2019, as directed, the Claimants filed their Statement of Costs (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Costs Statement**\") and the Respondent filed its Schedules of Costs Relating to Jurisdiction and to Substantive Proceedings (Excluding Costs of Jurisdiction Application) (the \"**Respondent\u2019s Costs Statement**\").\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below the factual background as relevant to the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings, based on the Parties\u2019 documentary and witness evidence. The record reflects several significant factual disputes.\n\n46.\n\nAs will be seen, the Claimants corrected and supplemented certain aspects of the factual background as they reacted to Sri Lanka\u2019s case and as Mr Eyre located additional documents in his personal records. The Tribunal includes the evolving presentation of the facts in this Factual Background section, identified as such.\n\n**A. The Montrose Land and the Initial Development Projects**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Montrose Land is a plot of land of approximately 3.87 acres on the banks of Lake Diyawanna, approximately eight kilometres to the southeast of downtown Colombo and bordering the township of Kotte. When the Montrose Land was officially surveyed in August 1978, it was owned by Electro Plastics Limited, which had a factory on the site. The then Managing Director of Electro Plastics Limited, Dr Sir Don Buddadasa Wethasinghe, had the idea to redevelop the Montrose Land for a hotel.\n\n48.\n\nOn 11 September 1979, the Urban Development Authority of Sri Lanka (the \"**UDA**\") granted preliminary planning approval to Dr Wethasinghe for the proposed hotel on the following terms:\n\n*With reference to your letter dated 21 August 1979, forwarding the preliminary plans submitted by your architects, Messrs Alfred Wong Associates of Singapore, there is no objection to the proposed development from a planning point of view. You will, however, be required to submit detailed drawings to the Local Authority for formal approval.... It is presumed that you have received the approval of the Ceylon Tourist Board for the Hotel Complex.*3\n\nMemorial, para 15; Exhibit C-11.\n\n49.\n\nOn 13 September 1979, the Ceylon Tourist Board granted Dr Wethasinghe conditional permission to construct a 212-room hotel complex, subject to certain conditions including the provision of detailed cost estimates and an implementation plan within three months of approval and ideally the commencement of construction within six months.\n\n50.\n\nDr Wethasinghe thereafter advanced his plans to develop the hotel. At some point prior to October 1980, the name of Electro Plastics Limited was changed to Electro Holiday Resorts Ltd (\"**Electro Resorts**\"). In May 1980, a further survey was undertaken of both the Montrose Land and an approximately seven-acre plot on the far side of Lake Diyawanna (later purchased by Mr Eyre and known as the \"**Natiso Land**\"). The Montrose Land and the Natiso Land are shown as Plots 1 and 2, on the left and right side, respectively, on the survey reproduced below.4\n\nMemorial, para 17.2; Exhibit C-13.\n\n51.\n\nIt was also in 1980 that Dr Wethasinghe met Mr Eyre. Dr Wethasinghe retained Samuel Montagu & Co in London to facilitate financing to develop the Montrose Land hotel, and Mr Eyre was assigned to assist him. Mr Eyre recalls that Dr Wethasinghe considered the hotel development plan to have great potential, because the Sri Lankan government planned to build a new parliament complex on an island in Diyawanna Lake and there would be renewed interest in the Kotte area. Mr Eyre also recalls that he actively approached a number of international banks and there was \"an appetite for providing funding\" including from Chase Manhattan and Citibank, but works \"ground to a halt with the outbreak of civil war in Sri Lanka in July 1983\".5 The hotel financing work was put on indefinite hold, but, in the course of their dealings, Dr Wethasinghe and Mr Eyre developed a close friendship. Mr Eyre thereafter attended many Wethasinghe family events including the marriage of Dr Wethasinghe's son, Mr Ravi Wethasinghe.\n\nWitness Statement of Raymond Charles Eyre dated 2 August 2017 (\"**First Eyre Statement**\"), paras 6-7.\n\n52.\n\nOn 31 October 1991, the UDA granted conditional planning permission to Electro Resorts for \"Residential Development\" and \"Mixed Development of Residential and Commercial Development of Shops & Offices Only\" for the Montrose Land and Natiso Land.6\n\nMemorial, para 17.4; Exhibit C-16.\n\n53.\n\nDr Wethasinghe died in 1996, after which control of Electro Resorts passed to his son. Ravi Wethasinghe continued efforts to develop the Montrose Land, the Natiso Land and two other nearby parcels known as the \"Wethasinghe Land\" and the \"Tubal Land\".\n\n54.\n\nIn November 2000, the UDA wrote to Ravi Wethasinghe confirming that it had granted preliminary planning clearance, which would be valid for one year, for the development of the Montrose Land and nearby parcels subject to certain planning guidelines and instructions.\n\n55.\n\nOver the next several years, Ravi Wethasinghe was engaged in several business ventures in Sri Lanka. He controlled a Sri Lankan company, La'tec, which built buses for the public transportation system. In or around 2001, when Sri Lanka began to privatise bus routes, Ravi Wethasinghe determined to try to bid on certain bus routes. To obtain the personal financing to do so, he turned to Mr Eyre, who was then at Bank of America. Mr Eyre initially refused. In 2003, Ravi Wethasinghe obtained planning permission and financing for the Wethasinghe Land, on which a residential complex ultimately was built.\n\n**B. The Lease of the Montrose Land to Mr Eyre**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn around 2003, Ravi Wethasinghe bid for a privatised bus route but could not afford to pay the US$ 1.1 million bond required by the Sri Lankan government. Out of loyalty to Ravi Wethasinghe's father, Mr Eyre reconsidered his original refusal to lend funds to Ravi Wethasinghe and agreed to provide the financing for the bond by way of a personal loan from himself and his wife (a Singapore national) of US$ 1.1 million, subject to being granted a lease on the Montrose Land as security for the loan. Mr Eyre attributed his decision to make the loan to Ravi Wethasinghe to \"loyalty to his late father\",7 and testified at the Hearing on Jurisdiction as follows:\n\n*I was still at Bank of America. At the last minute when he was due to make a bid for the bus companies he called me to say he did not have the money to put up the bid bond and would I help him, which I guess is a phone call I regret to this day, frankly, but it did happen. I lent him I think approximately $1 million converted into rupees, but it was around $1 million to go into the bid bond.... He was the youngest son of a very dear old friend of mine and I agreed to that to try to see if the project could go through.*8\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 10.\n\nTr Day One 113:12-114:9.\n\n57.\n\nThere is no loan agreement or other documentation in the record concerning Mr Eyre's US$ 1.1 million loan to Ravi Wethasinghe. When asked on cross-examination at the Jurisdiction Hearing whether he had entered into a written loan agreement with Ravi Wethasinghe, Mr Eyre testified: \"I am fairly sure we didn't because it was just a rush of time\".9 Mr Eyre recalled that he paid the total US$ 1.1 million to Ravi Wethasinghe in more than one sum, but he could not locate any bank documents showing definitively when and how the sums were paid.10 Nor could Mr Eyre locate any documents concerning the related debt owed to him by Ravi Wethasinghe.11\n\nTr Day One 138:11-15.\n\nTr Day One 141:18-24, 145:21-146:11.\n\nTr Day One 150:20-24.\n\n58.\n\nOn 11 August 2005, Electro Resorts granted Mr Eyre a lease over the Montrose Land for 25 years expiring on 30 June 2030 (the \"**Lease**\").12 The Lease is written and notarised.13 The Lease makes no reference to a US$ 1.1 million loan from Mr Eyre to Ravi Wethasinghe. The Lease recites that the monthly rental is to be Sri Lankan Rupees (\"**Rs**\") 125,000 for a total rental of Rs 30 million over the 25-year lease period, and that:\n\n*the Lessee has deposited with the Lessor a sum of **Rupees Thirty Million** (**Rs.30,000,000** /-) at the time of execution of these presents (the receipt whereof the Lessor doth hereby admit and acknowledge) to be set off on account of the monthly rental throughout the leasehold period.*14\n\nMemorial, para 24; Exhibit C-27; First Eyre Statement, para 11.\n\nExhibit C-27, pages 6-8.\n\nExhibit C-27, page 2 (emphasis in original).\n\n59.\n\nMr Eyre testified that he could not remember whether he had in fact made the deposit of Rs 30 million, and suggested that the comparatively low rental fee in relation to the size of his loan to Ravi Wethasinghe might be because he also arranged a mortgage on the Natiso Land.15\n\nTr Day One 147:9-25, 148:1-19.\n\n60.\n\nAt around the same time as the lease in 2005, Ravi Wethasinghe informed Mr Eyre of his plans to develop the Montrose Land and nearby parcels, noting that he had secured approval in late 2000 from the Sri Lankan Board of Investment for a mixed development project with foreign collaboration on the Montrose and Natiso Land. In that connection, Ravi Wethasinghe asked Mr Eyre to contribute US$ 350,000 in funding for the initial development of the land. Mr Eyre agreed, subject to the requirements, first, that the US$ 350,000 be distributed over three months and repaid by 31 March 2008 and, second, that he be appointed a director of Electro Resorts.16 Ravi Wethasinghe agreed to these requirements, which were recorded, not at the time, but some two years later in an Agreement to Finance dated 13 December 2007.17 Mr Eyre testified that he could not locate bank records documenting when and how he made the US$ 350,000 loan to Ravi Wethasinghe.18\n\nMemorial, para 26; First Eyre Statement, para 13.\n\nMemorial, para 26; Exhibit C-29.\n\nTr Day One 133:2-6.\n\n**C. The Incorporation of Montrose Developments (Private****) Limited and the Sale of the Montrose Land**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn early 2010, Ravi Wethasinghe proposed to transfer title to the Montrose Land to Mr Eyre rather than repay the loans. Mr Eyre decided that his \"best option was to progress the hotel development and recoup the loaned sums from its eventual sale\", and so he agreed with Ravi Wethasinghe to take the title and \"transfer an additional sum as consideration for the Montrose Land\".19\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, paras 14-15.\n\n62.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the board of Electro Resorts resolved to sell the Montrose Land to Mr Eyre for the \"negotiated sum\" of Rs 100 million (approximately US$ 887,000).20\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 16; Exhibit C-33.\n\n63.\n\nOn 3 August 2010, Montrose Developments Private Limited (again, the second Claimant, \"**Montrose**\") was incorporated as a Sri Lankan private limited company with one share (the \"**Montrose share**\"), to hold legal title to the Montrose Land. According to Mr Eyre, his \"understanding at the time was that it was necessary for a Sri Lankan company to have a Sri Lankan national as the initial subscriber of shares and company director in order to comply with local legal requirements\".21 At the suggestion of a business associate in the tourism business, Mr Wijeratne, Mr Joseph Ranjan Fernando was named the nominee shareholder and director of Montrose. Mr Eyre testified repeatedly that Montrose was to be only the legal owner of the Montrose Land, while he was to be the beneficial owner and Mr Fernando was to act only on his instructions. According to Mr Eyre:\n\n*The intention and understanding of all concerned was that at all times that I would retain full beneficial ownership and control over the company.*22\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 18.\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 18.\n\n64.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr Eyre testified on cross-examination that he did not use or understand the phrase \"beneficial interest\".23\n\nTr Day One 196:11-15, 204:25, 205:1-2.\n\n65.\n\nThere was no written agreement between Mr Eyre and Mr Fernando. The Claimants\u2019 evidence is that, to ensure Mr Fernando could be removed as the sole director of Montrose at any time, Mr Eyre (through Mr Wijeratne) obtained a signed and undated resignation letter from Mr Fernando, a copy of which is in the record.24 At the Jurisdiction Hearing, Mr Wijeratne testified that Mr Fernando also provided a signed blank share transfer form, but no copy of that form was entered in the record.25\n\nMemorial, para 29; Exhibit C-85.\n\nTr Day One 235:3-7.\n\n66.\n\nSri Lanka disputes Mr Eyre\u2019s testimony on the reason for having Mr Fernando serve as the nominee shareholder and director of Montrose. According to Sri Lanka, there were no legal restrictions at the time precluding foreign shareholders or directors from acquiring Sri Lankan land, but Section 58(1) of the Finance Act No 11 of 1963 (the \"**Sri Lankan Finance Act**\") did give rise to a statutory obligation on a foreign citizen purchasing Sri Lankan land to pay a tax equivalent to the full value of the property.26 Sri Lanka argues that the real purpose for Mr Eyre to incorporate Montrose with Mr Fernando as sole shareholder and director must have been to evade this 100% tax on the purchase of the Montrose Land from Electro Resorts.27\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections Pursuant to Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention (\"**Preliminary Objections**\"), para 20; Finance Act No 11 of 1963 (RL-2).\n\nPreliminary Objections, paras 20-22.\n\n67.\n\nOn 4 August 2010, one day after Montrose was incorporated, Electro Resorts transferred ownership of the Montrose Land to Montrose by a Deed of Transfer.28 The Deed of Transfer, which is notarised by Ms Sarjonie Mudalige, provides in relevant part:\n\n*AND WHEREAS the VENDOR has agreed with MONTROSE DEVELOPMENTS (PRIVATE) LIMITED a company duly incorporated in the Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka... (hereinafter called and referred to as the PURCHASER...) for the absolute sale and conveyance to the PURCHASER all that allotment of land depicted in Plan No.1700... free of all encumbrances and charges whatsoever at or for the price of sum of RUPEES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONLY (Rs100,000,000/-) of lawful money of the said Republic of Sri Lanka.*\n\n*NOW KNOW YE AND THESE PRESENTS WITNESS that in pursuance of the said agreement and in consideration of the said sum of RUPEES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONLY (RS.100,000,000/-) of lawful money of the said Republic of Sri Lanka well and truly paid to the VENDOR by the PURCHASER (the receipt whereof the VENDOR doth hereby expressly admit and acknowledge) the VENDOR doth hereby sell grant convey transfer assign set over and assure unto the PURCHASER all that allotment of land depicted in Plan No.1700... **.***\n\nMemorial, para 32; Exhibits C-7 and C-35.\n\n68.\n\nThe notary added at the end of her certification:\n\n*I further certify and attest that the within mentioned consideration was not passed in my presence.29*\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants admit that there was no written sale contract for the Montrose Land:\n\n*The Claimants have never relied on a written contract of sale because no such contract exists. As Mr Eyre says, the Montrose Land was transferred by way of a Deed of Transfer, which has already been disclosed.*30\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"**Rejoinder**\"), para 188.\n\n70.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants describe the payment for the sale of the Montrose Land as coming some eight months later, on 4 April 2011. According to Mr Eyre in his First Witness Statement:\n\n*Shortly before 4 April 2011, I transferred the additional sums in respect of the purchase price from another company, Montrose Developments Pte Limited (Montrose Singapore) (which is owned 99% by me), to a bank account held by Electro Holidays* [footnote to Exhibit C-44]*.*31\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 20.\n\n71.\n\nIn their Memorial, the Claimants rely on a written receipt from Electro Resorts to Montrose Developments Pte Limited (\"**Montrose Singapore**\") dated 4 April 2011, which is Exhibit C-44, as proof of this payment. Exhibit C-44, which became the focus of substantial discussion and dispute between the Parties, merits quoting in full. The document is on Electro Resorts letterhead, is dated 4 April 2011, is headed \"Receipt\", and is signed by \"Director for Electro Holiday Resorts Ltd\" (apparently Ravi Wethasinghe).\n\n*We do hereby acknowledge receipt of US$ 1000,000/-(US Dollars One Million Only) from Montrose Developments (PVT) Ltd being the purchase price of land depicted in plan no 1700 dated 14th February 1978 made by S.J.Setunga Licensed Surveyor containing in extent THREE ACRES THREE ROODS AND TWENTY FIVE PERCHES (A3.R3.P25) and situated at Kotuwegoda in the district of Colombo which* [sic - is] *more fully described in the schedule to the Deed of Transfer No 2207 dated 04th August 2010 attested by C.K.I.P.A. Mudalige, Notary Public.*32\n\nExhibit C-44.\n\n72.\n\nIn its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, Sri Lanka describes Exhibit C-44 as a \"curious document\" in that it refers to receipt from Montrose Singapore of US$ 1 million, rather than Rs 100 million or the US dollar equivalent of US$ 887,000 described by Mr Eyre.33 Further, Montrose Singapore was not incorporated until September 2011, some five months later.34 At the Jurisdiction Hearing, Mr Eyre testified that he wanted to correct the original reference of \"(Montrose Singapore)\" in Exhibit C-44 to \"(Montrose Sri Lanka)\".35\n\nPreliminary Objections, para 17.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para 17.\n\nTr Day One 109:3-12.\n\n73.\n\nIn their Counter-Memorial, having undertaken a further document search and obtained records from BNP Paribas Wealth Management (among other banks at which Mr Eyre had accounts), the Claimants withdrew their reliance on Exhibit C-44 as evidence of payment for the Montrose Land and corrected the evidentiary record. They explain in the Counter-Memorial that Montrose Aircraft Leasing Pte Limited (\"**Montrose Aircraft Leasing**\"), a Singapore company within the Montrose Group of companies owned 99% by Mr Eyre (the \"**Montrose Group**\"), made a payment on 5 July 2012 of US$ 400,055 to Latec International Logistics and Shipping Pte Ltd (\"**Latec International**\"), a company of which Ravi Wethasinghe was a 50% shareholder and a director.36 The Claimants rely on contemporaneous emails between Mr Eyre and Ravi Wethasinghe in June and July 2012 to confirm that the US$ 400,055 was a contribution in respect of the Montrose Land. In those emails, Ravi Wethasinghe provided Mr Eyre with reports on the Montrose Land title search; Mr Eyre agreed to release US$ 400,000 \"as a sign of good faith and to keep the approvals process going\";37 Ravi Wethasinghe asked that the payment be made into the Latec International account; Mr Eyre so directed the payment; and Ravi Wethasinghe acknowledged receipt of the payment.38\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Counter-Memorial**\"), para 11; Exhibit C-91.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 11.4.1; Witness Statement of Raymond Charles Eyre dated 25 April 2018 (\"**Second Eyre Statement**\"), para 20(b); Exhibit C-89.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 11.4.2-11.4.4; Exhibits C-90\u2013C-92 and R-12.4.\n\n74.\n\nIn its Reply, Sri Lanka accuses the Claimants of retreating from reliance on the 4 April 2011 Electro Resorts receipt in Exhibit C-44 \"because its contents are untrue, i.e. it was manufactured for some ulterior reason\".39 The Claimants object to this characterisation in their Rejoinder, stating that \"Mr Eyre relied on this receipt as he could not precisely recall the payment in question [which] was in the context of a personal transaction, managed without the corporate infrastructure of the Montrose Group\".40 Further, say the Claimants, the receipt was not generated by Montrose but by Electro Resorts. In his Second Witness Statement, Mr Eyre explains that, despite significant efforts, he had \"not been able to find the relevant entry for the payment to Electro Holidays\" of the purchase price for the Montrose Land.41\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction (\"**Reply**\"), para 4.\n\nRejoinder, para 185.\n\nSecond Eyre Statement, para 18.\n\n75.\n\nThere is an entry on the 2012 Montrose books indicating that the sum of Rs 100 million payable to Electro Resorts was settled directly by Mr Eyre, and so was treated as a loan repayable by Montrose to Mr Eyre.42 In specific, the Notes to the Financial Statement in the Independent Auditor's Report of 14 August 2013 record the sum of Rs 100 million as payable to Electro Resorts in 2010/2011 and to Mr Eyre in 2011/2012, followed by:\n\n*Note: The amounts payable to Electro Holiday Resorts (Pvt) Ltd on land acquisition, had been settled by the director Mr.R C Eyre.*\n\n*Accordingly the company has to pay that amount to Mr.R C Eyre.*43\n\nPreliminary Objections, para 25; Exhibit R-5.\n\nExhibit R-5, page 11.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants deny that any such loan was made by Mr Eyre. They explain that \"this was nothing more than a book debt reflecting the anticipated payment of the purchase price of the Montrose Land by Mr Eyre on Montrose's behalf\u2019,44 which did not occur.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 18.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants confirm in their Counter-Memorial that further document searches did not uncover any documents concerning Mr Eyre's original loans to Ravi Wethasinghe of US$ 1.1 million and US$ 350,000. Counsel for the Claimants assert that this is \"unsurprising, as the transactions occurred over 10 years ago, and the payment records associated are not easily obtainable from the banks involved\".45\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 13.\n\n78.\n\nIn the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, Sri Lanka points out that Mr Eyre fails to mention in his evidence that, based on Minutes of the Montrose Board of Directors, Mr Fernando transferred the Montrose Share to Mr Eyre on 11 October 2010, which was subsequent to the 4 August 2010 Deed of Transfer of the Montrose Land and prior to the alleged payment for the Montrose Land by Montrose Singapore on 4 April 2011.46 In their Counter-Memorial, the Claimants explain that the 11 October 2010 transfer was defective under Sri Lankan law because of the lack of a completed share transfer form by which Mr Eyre consented to the transfer, and hence the transfer was never reported to the Registrar of Companies.47 The transfer was eventually regularised, say the Claimants, by the transfer of the Montrose Share from Mr Fernando to Montrose Singapore in March 2012.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para 26.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 20; Second Eyre Statement, para 22.\n\n79.\n\nIn response to criticism by Sri Lanka concerning the late discovery of certain documents and the absence of other documents underpinning various loans and payments, counsel for Mr Eyre emphasised that \"Mr Eyre's activities in Sri Lanka were very much of a personal character\" outside his busy professional finance practice.48 Mr Eyre testified that he did not conduct document searches on his personal computer and in fact he had changed computer systems at some point, but he personally did manual document searches \"over several weekends\".49 At the Jurisdiction Hearing, when asked in cross-examination what he thought of the criticisms made of the limited documentation of his alleged investment in Sri Lanka, Mr Eyre testified:\n\n*Well, I think in response to that I would like to say that this was not a business for me. This was really a personal favour I was doing and I was really trying to collect my debts. I was at the time this initially started as I just mentioned in the global leasing group at Bank of America. That was a $25 billion portfolio. I had 250 people working for me around the world. This event was a very small piece of my time.*\n\n*When I joined Montrose from Bank of America we had a 12 billion-dollar portfolio which was probably around 170 aircraft globally. Unfortunately, after the tragic events of 9/11, a number of those aircraft were parked, so my so-called semi-retirement job became a full-time job and that continued. So this was really a very small element of my time. It was an annoyance. It was an embarrassment to me that I had lent money to this guy but really he had just treated me in this manner.*50\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 4.\n\nTr Day One 152:5-23.\n\nTr Day One 116:4-23.\n\n80.\n\nIn its Reply, Sri Lanka relies heavily on the Memorandum of Understanding between Montrose Global and Electro Resorts (again, the \"**MOU**\"), which the Claimants produced after Mr Eyre's further document searches but did not mention or discuss in their Counter-Memorial.51 The MOU is undated, but, alleges Sri Lanka, presumably was signed sometime in late July 2010 before the 4 August 2010 Deed of Transfer.52 To situate the MOU in time, the Respondent relies on an email dated 23 July 2010 from Ravi Wethasinghe to Mr Eyre with the Subject heading of \"MOU\".53 The email reads in relevant part:\n\n*With your approval and agreement we can implement this without delay.*\n\n*A-1. Register Montrose Developments Ltd in Sri Lanka and Electro Holiday Resorts transfers ownership of this land to Montrose Developments Ltd.*\n\n*2. Value of the property for the deed will be US$ 1 Million, Montrose will pay US$ 1,000,000 (less any deposits paid) at the time of development of the hotel project.*\n\n*3. Stamp duty will be payable on the US$ 1 Million of the deed value of the property. That will come to approximately US$ 30,000. B-1. As per MOU between Montrose and Electro Holiday Resorts/Ravi agreement property value has been estimated at:*\n\n*US$ 18,000 per perch*  \n*US$ 11,250,000 for 625 perches*  \n*US$ 1,000,000 deed value that is deducted from final price*  \n*US$ 10,250,000 total land value*  \n*Total land value will be payable when the development/sale commences and will be jointly agreed by both parties.*\n\nReply, para 7; Exhibit R-12.3.\n\nReply, para 7.\n\nExhibit R-12.2.\n\n81.\n\nThe MOU sets out terms for the sale of the Montrose Land by Electro Resorts to Montrose Global, as follows:\n\n*As consideration for the land, Montrose Global LLP (\u2018Montrose') hereby agrees to pay US$1 million for the land upon completion of an appropriate Purchase and Sale Agreement and no later than 36 months from the date of the Purchase and Sale Agreement 30th September 2010.*\n\n*This land together with the land recently acquired by Natiso (Pvt) Ltd will form the basis of land for the Development Project (\u2018DP').*\n\n*DP will consist of the building of a new apartment block together with a Five Star hotel and associated serviced apartments, conference facilities and shopping centre.*\n\n*In relation to DP, Montrose will be responsible for all cost in relation to the negotiation for planning and actual implementation of DP. Montrose will be solely responsible for all negotiations relative to DP but will report to Electro at least once a month by written form.*\n\n*The DP to be 100% owned by Montrose but where a 50% beneficial interest on the profit will be maintained for Electro in addition to payment for the land itself of US$5million.*54\n\nExhibit R-12.3.\n\n82.\n\nThe MOU was signed by Mr Eyre as Managing Director of Montrose Global and Ravi Wethasinghe as Director of Electro Resorts.55 It is not notarised.\n\nExhibit R-12.3.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent characterises the MOU as a binding agreement under Sri Lankan law for Electro Resorts to sell the Montrose Land to Montrose Global, creating a constructive trust for Electro Resorts over the Montrose Land or at least over 50% of future profits from the hotel development on the Montrose Land as part of the overall development project (the\n\n\"**Development Project**\"). The Respondent emphasises the similarity between the terms in the MOU and those in the 4 April 2011 Electro Resorts receipt (Exhibit C-44), in particular the reference to US$ 1 million as a payable amount.56\n\nReply, para 12; Exhibit C-44.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants vigorously object to Sri Lanka's characterisation of and reliance on the MOU. In summary, their position is:\n\n*[T]he MOU is not a binding document under English law, which governs it. Instead, the MOU was intended simply to document the status at that point in time of negotiations between the parties concerning the transfer of the Montrose Land. As is common in such discussions, the parties' negotiations evolved. The Montrose Land was not transferred under the arrangement contemplated in the MOU. This is clear from the transaction that actually took place, which was on markedly different terms. Sri Lanka's hypothesised joint venture between Electro and Montrose Global did and does not exist.*57\n\nRejoinder, para 194.\n\n85.\n\nIn his testimony at the Jurisdiction Hearing, Mr Eyre stated that he did not mention the MOU in his Witness Statements because he did not consider it significant:\n\n*I had not forgotten about it but, as I have tried to explain consistently, there were any number of discussions, promises, with Mr Wethasinghe. By this stage it was somewhat of a nonsense, frankly, to think that something was actually going to happen with Mr Wethasinghe. If I may just finish, I signed probably 100 MOUs a year, and probably 95 per cent of those don't happen for whatever reason. It is a very common technique we use in aircraft asset financing to describe a potential transaction, but unfortunately very rarely does that turn out to be [sic] true transaction.*58\n\nTr Day One 158:3-14.\n\n86.\n\nSri Lanka requested production of related documents subsequent to the MOU. As noted in the Procedural History section above, the Tribunal ordered a further search for and production of such MOU-related documents. The Claimants reported that none could be found.\n\n**D. The Montrose Land Development Planning**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nWith improved prospects for Sri Lankan tourism following the end of the civil war in 2009, Mr Eyre took steps to explore development of the Montrose Land as a 250-room \"mid-market\" hotel, in conjunction with a luxury serviced apartment complex to be constructed on the Natiso Land.59\n\nMemorial, para 34; First Eyre Statement, para 23.\n\n88.\n\nAs he lacked personal experience in property development, Mr Eyre reached out to expert consultants. He retained HVS Hospitality Services, which reported in a November 2010 feasibility study and development strategy paper that the Montrose Land Hotel Project likely would be successful, at a development cost of approximately US$ 53 million inclusive of land cost of US$ 21,159,178.60 Mr Eyre also retained the international firm Woods Bagot, assisted by the Sri Lankan firm Arch International (Pvt) Limited, to provide architectural and design consultancy services and, on 18 May 2011, Woods Bagot delivered a \"Masterplan Initial Concepts: Developed Building Concepts\" proposal including a hotel with spa and fitness centre, residential and serviced apartments, and retail space.61 As he planned to involve an international hotel group in the project, Mr Eyre also approached various well-known hotel groups, which led to \"an overwhelmingly positive response\" as evidenced by meetings and site visits.62 The Starwood, Hyatt, Marriott and Langham hotel groups all made initial proposals.63\n\nMemorial, para 35.4; Exhibit C-37, page 8.\n\nMemorial, paras 36-38; Exhibits C-39 and C-45.\n\nMemorial, para 40; First Eyre Statement, para 28.\n\nMemorial, para 41; Exhibits C-41-43, C-46 and C-50.\n\n89.\n\nAs for financing the estimated development costs of approximately US$33 million (excluding the land cost), Mr Eyre approached various professional contacts at international banks with a presence in Sri Lanka, and found HSBC, Standard Chartered and CIMB to be preliminarily receptive.64 Mr Eyre testified about his financing plans as follows:\n\n*I planned to part-fund the hotel development using my own resources or the resources of Montrose Global and to obtain funding for the remainder of the development costs of the hotel from elsewhere. I intended to secure funding from a number of sources, including international and domestic banks, the International Finance Corporation (the **IFC**) and international hotel groups, the latter of which would contribute funds toward the development costs in exchange for an agreement that they would operate and manage the hotel in due course. I also intended to agree deferred payment mechanisms with the contractors working on the project in lieu of upfront payments. My plan was for [sic] to retain the completed hotel for a period of two to three years or until it was financial [sic] advantageous to sell it.*65\n\nMemorial, para 43; First Eyre Statement, para 26.\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 25 (emphasis in original).\n\n**E. The Dredging and Compulsory State Acquisition of the Montrose Land**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nIn September 2011, Woods Bagot informed Mr Eyre that the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (the \"**SLLRDC**\") was conducting dredging works in Lake Diyawanna close to the western boundary of the Montrose Land. Despite entreaties to the UDA by Montrose\u2019s Sri Lankan counsel, Ms Mudalige, the dredging continued and resulted in approximately three acres of the Montrose Land being submerged in Lake Diyawanna. The dredging also affected the nearby Tubal Land.\n\n91.\n\nMr Eyre nonetheless remained optimistic about development, thinking that the Montrose Land could be drained or the Hotel Project could be re-designed to be built on stilts. He and Ms Mudalige devoted substantial efforts in seeking assistance from the then-President of Sri Lanka, the UDA and the SLLRDC. At a meeting on 17 February 2012, attended by Mr Shafiq Iqbal as a representative of the Tubal Group, the Additional Secretary for Urban Development reportedly relayed strong government support for the Montrose Land development and suggested that the hotel plans be amended for construction on stilts in light of environmental concerns.66\n\nMemorial, para 50; Exhibit C-56.\n\n92.\n\nOn 12 March 2012, an amended application for preliminary planning clearance was submitted to the UDA on behalf of Montrose, which application was suspended and has not been processed.67\n\nMemorial, para 51; Exhibit C-55.\n\n93.\n\nOn 4 May 2012, the Greater Colombo Flood Control and Environmental Promotion Office (the \"**FCEPO**\") issued a notice pursuant to the Sri Lankan Land Acquisition Act authorizing FCEPO to enter the Montrose Land for the purpose of surveying it to determine whether the land was suitable for a public purpose.68\n\nMemorial, para 55; Exhibit C-60.\n\n94.\n\nOn 30 November 2012, Mr Eyre and Mr Iqbal arranged a meeting with the Secretary of Defence and Urban Development, which was attended by Ms Mudalige, the British High Commissioner and the Deputy British High Commissioner on behalf of Mr Eyre and Montrose. The dredging was discussed but no conclusion was reached.69\n\nMemorial, para 57; Exhibit C-63.\n\n95.\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Sri Lanka issued a Gazette Notice confirming that it was proceeding to acquire the Montrose Land.70\n\nMemorial, para 58: Exhibit C-64.\n\n96.\n\nOn 10 July 2013, a Gazette Notice recorded that the Montrose Land was needed for a public purpose and was being compulsorily acquired under Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act.71\n\nMemorial, para 58; Exhibit C-68.\n\n97.\n\nOn 10 April 2015, a Gazette Notice published under Section 7 of the Sri Lankan Land Acquisition Act requested all persons interested in the Montrose Land to notify a certain Mr C.W. Abeysuriya of the nature of their interest and be prepared to appear on 15 May 20 1 5.72 Mr Wijeratne notified Mr Abeysuriya of Montrose\u2019s interest in the Montrose Land and requested compensation of Rs 2,749,700,000 (approximately US$ 20,705,241). Ms Mudalige appeared on behalf of Montrose and confirmed Montrose\u2019s title to the land.\n\nMemorial, para 59; Exhibit C-71.\n\n98.\n\nOn 3 July 2015, Mr Wijeratne wrote to Mr Abeysuriya and requested compensation of 5 million RS per perch.73 No offer of compensation was forthcoming.\n\nMemorial, para 60; Exhibit C-73.\n\n99.\n\nMr Eyre directed Mr Wijeratne to make a claim to the Land Acquisition Board for compensation. To that end, Mr Wijeratne commissioned a report from a retired former Sri Lankan government chief valuer, who valued the Montrose Land, under restrictions the Claimants understood to be applicable in Sir Lankan compensation proceedings, at Rs 1,891,000,000 (approximately US$ 13,218,090).74 (Apparently this report was initially put under Ravi Wethasinghe's name, which Mr Wijeratne explained was a mistake resulting from Ravi Wethasinghe having used the same former government chief valuer to value Electro Resorts' neighbouring plot of land.75) Mr Wijeratne included the Montrose Land valuation report in the claim made to the Land Acquisition Board on 5 December 2016.\n\nMemorial, para 63; Exhibit C-81.\n\nTr Day One 242:6-14; Tr Day Two 446:5-447:1.\n\n100.\n\nOn 8 December 2016, the Land Acquisition Board awarded Montrose the sum of Rs 123,738,500 (approximately US$ 838,947) as compensation for the Montrose Land.76\n\nMemorial, para 64; Exhibit C-82.\n\n101.\n\nOn 4 January 2017, on Mr Eyre's instructions, this compensation award was appealed to the Land Acquisition Board of Review. According to counsel for both the Claimants and the Respondent, the appeal remained pending as of the Jurisdiction Hearing.77\n\nTr Day One 60:2-16.\n\n102.\n\nNo entity other than Montrose, including Electro Resorts and Ravi Wethasinghe, submitted any notification of an interest in the Montrose Land in response to the 10 April 2015 Gazette Notice.\n\n103.\n\nMuch of Mr Eyre's correspondence with Sri Lankan government officials over the course of this land acquisition and compensation process, as with his correspondence with hotel development consultants before the Montrose Land was dredged, was on letterhead and under email addresses of Montrose Global rather than Montrose itself. The Claimants explain this as normal commercial practice for the head of a closely-held corporate group of companies such as the Montrose Group.78\n\nFor example, Second Eyre Statement, para 12.\n\n**F. Montrose Developments Pte Ltd**\n------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nAccording to Mr Eyre, when he was exploring possible financing for the Montrose Land Hotel Project in the spring of 2012, \"concerns... had been raised by financial institutions... in respect of the legal ownership of the [Montrose] share\".79 To alleviate such concerns, Mr Eyre directed that legal title to the Montrose Share be transferred from Mr Fernando to Montrose Singapore, as another company in the Montrose Group owned 99% by him.\n\nMemorial, para 52; First Eyre Statement, para 21.\n\n105.\n\nOn 31 March 2012, a share transfer form was executed and the Montrose share ledger was updated to reflect that the Montrose Share was owned by Montrose Singapore.80 On 19 June 2012, a share certificate was issued in favour of Montrose Singapore.81 Mr Fernando resigned his directorship of Montrose, and Mr Eyre and Mr Wijeratne became directors of Montrose.\n\nMemorial, para 53; Exhibit C-58.\n\nMemorial, para 53; Exhibit C-61.\n\n106.\n\nThe Parties dispute the terms on which Montrose Singapore holds the Montrose Share. The Claimants\u2019 evidence is that Mr Eyre, through the transfer from Mr Fernando, remains the beneficial owner of Montrose. Sri Lanka points to Montrose Singapore\u2019s Financial Year 2014 year-end accounts, which expressly describe Montrose Singapore as the equity owner of Montrose, with total assets valued at US$ 1,474,063 including the Montrose Land.82\n\nPreliminary Objections, para 29; Exhibit R-4, page 4.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent requests that the \"Claimants\u2019 claims... be dismissed on each, alternatively any, of the jurisdictional grounds\" raised by the Respondent and that the Claimants \"should pay the Respondent\u2019s costs of these jurisdictional proceedings\".\n\n**B. The Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nIn their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n*DISREGARD OR DEEM WAIVED those jurisdictional objections that Sri Lanka could have but failed to raise in the Preliminary Objections on the basis set out in Rules 41(1), 26(3) and 27 of the ICSID Rules - particularly the objections set out in \u00a7\u00a7B, D and E of the Reply and those objections which depend on the reasoning set out therein;*\n\n*OTHERWISE DISMISS Sri Lanka's jurisdiction objections as reflected in the Preliminary Objections and the Reply;*\n\n*CONFIRM its jurisdiction over this dispute;*\n\n*MAKE such other or further orders as it sees fit; and*\n\n*ORDER that Sri Lanka pay the Claimants' costs of this jurisdiction phase of the proceedings in any event and immediately, without awaiting the conclusion of the merits phase.*\n\n**V. RESPONDENT\u2019S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS: IN SUMMARY**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nJust as the factual background presented by the Claimants evolved over the course of the proceedings, so did the focus and organisation of the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, particularly in relation to the MOU. The Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections are set out below in their three major iterations, which the Tribunal found to complicate the necessary understanding and analysis of the objections.\n\n110.\n\nTo establish certain parameters at the start, it is undisputed that: (a) Montrose has legal title to and owns the Montrose Land; and (b) Montrose Singapore has equity title to and owns the Montrose Share, and hence directly owns Montrose. Although the Claimants originally asserted that Mr Eyre beneficially owns the Montrose Land, their position changed to a claim that Mr Eyre has a beneficial ownership interest not in the Montrose Land but in the Montrose Share through his 99% ownership of Montrose Singapore.\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Initial Jurisdictional Objections**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nIn its initial Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, Sri Lanka sought dismissal of the Claimants\u2019 claims on several grounds under three main headings.\n\n112.\n\nFirst, Sri Lanka alleged that neither Mr Eyre nor Montrose has standing as a protected \"investor\" to invoke the offer to arbitrate in Article 8(2) or, alternatively, in Article 8(1) of the BIT. As to Article 8(2), the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment in the Montrose Land through Montrose as a Sri Lankan incorporated company gives rise to exclusive application of Article 8(2), and neither of the Claimants can satisfy Article 8(2) because the shareholding in Montrose was at all material times directly owned by Montrose Singapore, which has no standing under the UK-Sri Lanka BIT. As to Article 8(1), if there is a jurisdictional basis to circumvent Article 8(2), it is necessary to establish that the alleged investor actively made the investment within the meaning of Article 8(1), which Mr Eyre cannot satisfy because it was only Montrose Singapore that took on the risk, funding and decision-making roles in relation to the Montrose Land.\n\n113.\n\nSecondly, Sri Lanka alleged that there has been no \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, because: (a) there is no evidence that the Claimants actually paid for the Montrose Land; (b) the Claimants did not make any commitment of any duration or take any risk to develop the Montrose Land, having undertaken only pre-investment activity; and/or (c) the acquisition of the Montrose Land *per se* did not contribute to the economic development of Sri Lanka. Further, the claims advanced do not \"directly arise\" out of any alleged investment as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, because the alleged investment is the alleged acquisition of the Montrose Land and not the \"future aspirational hotel development plans in respect of which there was no contractual commitment at the time of making the investment\".83\n\nPreliminary Objections, para 13.\n\n114.\n\nThirdly, Mr Eyre\u2019s claim to have a beneficial interest in Montrose, by way of a trustee/nominee relationship both when Mr Fernando was the legal owner and when Montrose Singapore was the legal owner, does not assist in giving him standing under the BIT, because the alleged beneficial interest: (a) does not provide a basis for circumventing Article 8(2) of the BIT; (b) fails under Sri Lankan law; and (c) is not entitled to protection under the BIT, as an invalid investment under Sri Lankan law.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections in Its Reply on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, in part due to the evolving presentation of facts and legal argument in the Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Sri Lanka articulated nine separate Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections under the following headings:\n\nObjection 1 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* or subject matter jurisdiction, in respect of Mr Eyre\u2019s shareholding in Montrose Singapore, because Article 1(a) of the BIT does not extend to \"indirect shareholdings\".\n\nObjection 2 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae,* or personal jurisdiction, over: (a) Montrose, because it does not constitute a company of the United Kingdom; and (b) Mr Eyre, because he is not the owner of the Montrose Share.\n\nObjection 3 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* because a shareholder lacks standing to claim under the BIT for alleged loss of shareholder value reflective of alleged loss of corporate value.\n\nObjection 4 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* because Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT does not extend to an alleged beneficial interest.\n\nObjection 5 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* because Mr Eyre has no beneficial interest in the shares of Montrose in any event.\n\nObjection 6 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants cannot make claims in respect of Electro Resorts, which holds the Montrose Land on constructive trust.\n\nObjection 7 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because there was no investment under either Article 1 of the BIT or Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, because no payment was made for the Montrose Land.\n\nObjection 8 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Mr Eyre made no contribution and took no action that would confer upon him the status of an investor pursuant to the BIT.\n\nObjection 9 : The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because, if the Montrose Share was held on trust for Mr Eyre, then it was not for a lawful purpose and constituted illegitimate tax avoidance, and Sri Lanka did not agree to give investment protection in these circumstances.\n\n**C. The Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections at the Jurisdiction Hearing and in Its Closing Submissions**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nAt the Jurisdiction Hearing, counsel for Sri Lanka presented the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections not in the order utilised in the Reply but instead, \"because we say you have to build up\", first under the category of the \"Montrose Land level\" and then under the category of the \"shareholder level\".84 The Respondent used essentially the same order in its Closing Submissions, as set out below.\n\nTr Day One 55:2-57:3.\n\n117.\n\nAt the Montrose Land level, Sri Lanka challenges jurisdiction on two overlapping bases focused on investment treaty interpretation principles:\n\nObjection A : Based on the MOU, Montrose cannot claim in respect of Electro Resorts' beneficial interest in the Montrose Land and its profit-earning capability and/or the Montrose Land does not constitute an investment of Montrose under Article 1(a)(ii) and Article 8(1) of the BIT.\n\nObjection B : Applying the *Salini* principles,85 the Montrose Land is not an investment under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, because Montrose and Mr Eyre did not make any contribution to acquire the Montrose Land and took no investment risk.\n\n*Salini Construttori SpA & Italstrade SpA v Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No ARB/00/04, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001 (\"***Salini***\"), para 38 (CL-26).\n\n118.\n\nAt the shareholder level, Sri Lanka challenges jurisdiction on six bases:\n\nObjection C : Any alleged shareholder claim by Mr Eyre is dependent upon the Montrose Land constituting an asset of Montrose, which it is not.\n\nObjection D : Indirect shareholders are not covered by Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT and, under Article 8(2) of the BIT, a locally incorporated company does not take the nationality of an indirect shareholder.\n\nObjection E : A beneficial interest in shares is not covered by Article (1)(a)(ii) of the BIT and in any event Mr Eyre did not have a beneficial interest in the Montrose Share.\n\nObjection F : Mr Eyre's alleged beneficial interest is not in accordance with law and good faith, and is void under Sri Lanka law.\n\nObjection G : Mr Eyre does not have a claim as indirect legal title holder to the Montrose Land.\n\nObjection H : Mr Eyre's reflective loss claim is not permitted under Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n119.\n\nFor the sake of good order and clarity, the Tribunal summarises the Parties' positions on the jurisdictional objections below using the framework of the Respondent's Closing Submissions - identified immediately above as Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections A through H - as closely as possible. Thereafter, as noted above, the Tribunal will analyse the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections in a different structure focusing on core issues of jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae.*\n\n**VI. PRELIMINARY JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS: THE MONTROSE LAND LEVEL**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection A : Montrose Cannot Claim in Respect of the Montrose Land and/or the Entirety of Its Alleged Profit-Earning Capability**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s primary Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection goes to jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* Sri Lanka argues that Montrose, although it is the legal owner of the Montrose Land, cannot claim under the BIT because, based on the MOU, the beneficial interest in the Montrose Land is vested in Electro Resorts. Sri Lanka argues that the Montrose Land was transferred pursuant to the signed MOU,86 which was a \"contractual memorandum of understanding\" entered into \"sometime in late July 2010 between Electro Resorts and Montrose Global LLP (not Mr Eyre), prior to the Deed of Transfer\".87 This is evident, argues Sri Lanka, from the email of 23 July 2010 from Ravi Wethasinghe to Mr Eyre allegedly preceding the signing of the MOU, \"which contemplated signing the MOU on Monday 26 July 2010\".88\n\nExhibit R-12.3,\n\nReply, para 7.\n\nExhibit R-12.2.\n\n121.\n\nAs set out in the Factual Background section above, the MOU envisioned the following: (i) Montrose Global would pay Electro Resorts US$ 1 million for the Montrose Land upon completion of a Purchase and Sale Agreement, and no later than 36 months from 30 September 2010; (ii) the Montrose Land and the Natiso Land would form the basis for the land for the Development Project of hotel, apartments, conference facilities and shopping centre; (iii) Montrose Global would own 100% of the Development Project, but \"a 50% beneficial interest on the profit will be maintained for Electro in addition to payment for the land itself of US$ 5 million\".89 However, according to Sri Lanka, the initial consideration of US$ 1 million was not paid.90\n\nReply, para 8.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 19.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the MOU \"has significant jurisdictional implications in and of itself apart from other fundamental jurisdictional obstacles\".91 In specific, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over any part of the claim or, alternatively, \"only has jurisdiction over the alleged claim less, at the very minimum according to the MOU, 50% of the alleged future profits and less USD 5 million and less USD 1 million; meaning that the maximum claim that can be put forward is USD 4,758,028.5[0]\".92\n\nReply, para 9.\n\nReply, para 295.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent bases its position on the application of the well-established principle of international law as set out in, for example, *Occidental v Ecuador.93* This, says Sri Lanka, necessarily excludes any claim in respect of the profit-earning capability of the Montrose Land based on the Hotel Project. Independent of this, and again on the principle in *Occidental v Ecuador* and in *Impregilo v Pakistan,* Montrose cannot claim under the BIT in respect of Electro Resorts' beneficial interest in the profit-earning capability of the Montrose Land, to the extent the MOU entitles Electro Resorts to 50% of such profits and US$ 5 million.94\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corp. v Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, 2 November 2015 (\"***Occidental***\"), paras 258-266 (RL-49).\n\n*Ibid* ; *Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/03, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, paras 151-155 (RL-132).\n\n124.\n\nSri Lanka argues that the Claimants cannot avoid this impact of Electro Resorts' beneficial interest on their claim by arguing that principles of customary international law are not applicable to the BIT. Applying the decision in *ELSI*,95 as exemplified in *Occidental v Ecuador,* clear wording in the BIT would be required for such an exclusion.\n\n*ELSI (United States v Italy)* (1989) ICJ 15 (RL-82).\n\n125.\n\nNor can the Claimants rely on the discussion of legal title in *Saba Fakes v Turkey* to support their claim, because the tribunal in that case did not have the benefit of the applicable rule of customary international law cited to it and therefore started on the premise that legal title of the relevant asset had to be excluded.96 Further, on the facts, the tribunal concluded that the claimant Mr Fakes, as the alleged legal title holder, was not the true owner but only a nominal owner.97\n\n*Saba Fakes v Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010 (\"***Saba Fakes***\"), para 134 (CL-75).\n\n*Saba Fakes*, para 137.\n\n126.\n\nFurther, and/or alternatively, Sri Lanka submits that the Montrose Land is not an \"investment\" of Montrose under Article 1(a) and 8(1) of the BIT, because Montrose is merely the trustee under Sri Lankan law (see below). For this treaty argument, Sri Lanka relies on *Blue Bank v Venezuela,* where the tribunal interpreted the relevant BIT and concluded, on the basis of the Barbados Trust Act, that the trustee had title of the relevant assets but did not own the assets in any relevant sense, and so the trustee could not claim.98 Here, under section 3(a) of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance, ownership is only nominally vested in the trustee, and so Montrose is not the owner of the Montrose Land in the true sense.99 Sri Lanka disagrees with the Claimants that *Blue Bank v Venezuela* turned on specific wording in the relevant BIT, that an asset had to be \"invested by the investor\", for two reasons. First, citing *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka v Hellenic Republic,* Sri Lanka says that this wording merely makes express what is implicit in all definitions of \"investment\".100 Secondly, citing *Standard Chartered Bank v Tanzania (\"**SCB v Tanzania**\"),* the UK-Sri Lanka BIT here conveys the same requirement by requiring in Article 8(1) that the investment be an investment \"of\u2019 the investor.101\n\n*Blue Bank International v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Award, 26 April 2017 (\"***Blue Bank***\"), paras 162, 168-169 (CL-232).\n\nAn Ordinance to Define and Amend the Law Relating to Trusts, 16 April 1918 (\"**Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance**\"), section 3(a) (RL-42).\n\n*Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka, a.s.. and Istrokapital SE v Hellenic Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/13/8, Award, 9 April 2015 (\"***Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank***\"), paras 230-246 (RL-100).\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank v United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/12, Award, 2 November 2012 (\"***SCB v Tanzania***\"), paras 198-201 (RL-1).\n\n127.\n\nApplying the facts to its BIT interpretation points, Sri Lanka argues that Montrose owns the Montrose Land only on constructive trust to the benefit of Electro Resorts under Sri Lankan law.\n\n128.\n\nUnder section 83 of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance, a constructive trust is created where it cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that the owner of the property intended to dispose of the beneficial ownership therein.102 The intention of the owner is to be ascertained objectively, with greater reliance on written evidence than oral evidence, and it is not necessary to establish a binding contract.103 Whether or not consideration has passed is a highly relevant circumstance.104 Section 83 of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance includes the Pallant-type trust, recognising that a constructive trust arises by operation of law when the circumstances render it unconscionable for a party to claim the entire beneficial interest in the relevant property and/or the proceeds of the property and deny the interest of another.105 The consequence of such a constructive trust is that any pecuniary advantage, including profits, is held on trust.106 A trust being a concept of equity, equity will disregard any attempt to evade its application, for example by piercing the corporate veil if the veil is being abused to frustrate the law.107 Also consistent with the notion of equity, a party is able to go behind the terms of a notarised deed to challenge the alleged payment of consideration. Proviso 1 of Section 92 of the Sri Lankan Evidence Ordinance expressly states that parole evidence is admissible to demonstrate the want or failure of consideration,108 and even the attestation of a notary that consideration has been paid does not establish the truth of payment, which still has to be proven.109\n\nSri Lankan Trust Ordinance, section 83.\n\n*Sudarshani v MHMG Somawathi*, SC Appeal/173/2011, 6 April 2017 (\"***Sudarshani***\"), pages 14-16 (RL-136).\n\n*WCK Kulasuriya v Harischandra*, SC Appeal No 157/2011, 4 April 2014, page 9 (RL-135).\n\n*Peter Farrar v David Miller,* [2018] EWCA Civ 172, paras 21 and 42 (RL-143), citing *Pallant v Morgan* [1953] Ch 43.\n\nSri Lankan Trust Ordinance, section 90.\n\n*Prest v Prest* [2013] 2 AC 415, paras 27, 35-36, 57-58, 61, 81-82, 96-97, 103-104 (RL-139).\n\nProviso 1 to section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance (RL-151); authorities include *Sudarshani*, pages 12-13.\n\n*Menika v Menike*, CA 846/96 (2013), headnote (5) (RL-153).\n\n129.\n\nExamining the circumstances of the ownership of the Montrose Land against these principles of Sri Lankan law, Sri Lanka submits that, on both the Respondent\u2019s case and the Claimants\u2019 case, \"[t]he critical point is that there was an agreement to pay for the Land (whether binding or informal) and payment was never made\" and \"[t]his automatically gives rise to a constructive trust\".110 On this point, the Respondent argues:\n\n*First, the true position - though not material for present purposes -is that the Land was transferred pursuant to the signed MOU; a document that was disclosed late in the day and constitutes the relevant attendant circumstance. Under the terms of the MOU, the consideration to be paid for the Land was USD 1 million. What is more, as Mr Eyre acknowledged, and is obvious from the email of 23 July 2010 preceding the signing of the MOU (which contemplated signing the MOU on Monday 26 July 2010), the Land was transferred following the signing of the MOU: Tr. Day 1/p.157/17-21.*111\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 13.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 14 (emphasis in original, footnotes omitted).\n\n130.\n\nSri Lanka firmly rejects the \"unfounded allegation in the Rejoinder that the MOU was subject to subsequent on-going negotiation\" and maintains its objection that Mr Eyre's unsupervised manual searches for emails around the MOU were inadequate.112 Sri Lanka asks that adverse inferences be drawn \"to the extent necessary to rebut any allegation that the MOU is not the relevant attendant circumstance and to rebut any allegation - were it to be advanced - that there was no agreement (formal or otherwise) to pay for the Land\".113\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, paras 15-16.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 17.\n\n131.\n\nIn any event and even without more documentation, argues Sri Lanka, the same constructive trust arises out of the Claimants' pleaded case and witness evidence. Mr Eyre in his First Witness Statement, and the Claimants in their Memorial, specifically referred to an agreement by Electro Resorts to sell the Montrose Land to \"Mr Eyre for Rs 100,000,000 (approximately USD 1 million)\", which was reiterated in the Rejoinder.114 The Electro Resorts board resolved on 27 July 2010 to sell the Montrose Land to Mr Eyre.115 Montrose was incorporated as the holding vehicle for the sale, with Mr Eyre retaining full beneficial ownership.116 Further, even though the Claimants originally relied on the receipt of 4 April 2011 from Electro Resorts as proof of payment of US$ 1 million, they later had to acknowledge that payment had not in fact been made. Mr Eyre testified that he could not locate a bank statement or equivalent showing the transfer of that sum in 2010, that Rs 100,000,000 or US$ 1 million was not paid in one lump sum \"for sure\", and that he did not know whether or not the sum had ever been paid.117\n\nMemorial, para 30; First Eyre Statement, paras 15-16; Rejoinder, para 215.\n\nExhibit C-33.\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, paras 17-18.\n\nTr Day One 118:23-25; 119:1-5; 128:7-11.\n\n132.\n\nIn these circumstances and applying the relevant Sri Lankan legal principles, the Respondent describes this as \"a classic case of Electro retaining the beneficial interest in the Land, by reason of a constructive trust being automatically imposed pursuant to section 83 of the Trust Ordinance\".118 The critical attendant circumstance to the transfer of the Montrose Land was Mr Eyre's agreement to pay Rs 100 million/US$ 1 million, which the Claimants have not proven was ever paid. It is undisputed that payment of this consideration was a binding commitment, whether under the MOU or otherwise, but in any event a constructive trust arises from an informal promise. The Claimants are wrong to submit that a party cannot go around the notarised Deed of Transfer for the Montrose Land sale to challenge alleged payment of consideration, especially as Ms Mudalige, in notarising the Deed of Transfer, added \"the mentioned consideration was not passed in my presence\".119\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 22.\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\n133.\n\nor does it help the Claimants to suggest that Electro Resorts has not enforced the trust by failing to file a claim for the Montrose Land with the government after the dredging, because, under Section 57 of the Land Acquisition Act, Electro Resorts is entitled to recover directly from Montrose any compensation paid to Montrose.120 To the extent relevant, because the trust attaches to the Montrose Land, equity would disregard the separate corporate personality of, first, Montrose Global as the party to the MOU and, second, Montrose, because Mr Eyre controls them both and used this control to evade Sri Lankan tax law. Even on the Claimants' case, says Sri Lanka:\n\n*the arrangement was with Mr Eyre personally, which reinforces the artificiality of distinguishing the corporate personality of the entities involved. Indeed, Montrose Global LLP described itself as having acquired the Land in its letter to the President of Sri Lanka of 10 October 2011.*121\n\nLand Acquisition Act (Law No. 9 of 1950), 9 March 1950, section 57 (CL-2).\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 22(e) (emphasis in original).\n\n134.\n\nTo the extent the Claimants rely on the alleged historical payments of US$ 1 million and US$ 350,000 by Mr Eyre to Ravi Wethasinghe, Sri Lanka considers those alleged loans to be irrelevant to the constructive trust. There is no evidence in the record documenting that Mr Eyre made those loan payments or that Mr Eyre treated the amounts as part of the consideration for the transfer of the Montrose Land.\n\n135.\n\nMoving beyond the Montrose Land itself to the profit-earning capability of the Montrose Land, the Respondent relies on operation of either a constructive trust or an express trust in favour of Electro Resorts. Under section 6 of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance, an express trust is created by words or acts through which the author of the trust indicates with reasonable certainty an intention to create a trust.122 As with a constructive trust, the requirement is reasonable certainty rather than a binding contract.\n\nSri Lankan Trust Ordinance, section 6 (RL-42).\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that the MOU was the basis on which Electro Resorts on 4 August 2010 transferred the Montrose Land to Montrose and the Natiso Land to Natiso, both companies of Mr Eyre. The Montrose Land and the Natiso Land, respectively, were to be used for the Development Project of the linked hotel and residential complex, in which Electro Resorts - as recited expressly in the MOU - was to have a 50% beneficial interest in profits and receive a later payment of US$ 5 million for the land. As Mr Eyre acknowledged, Electro Resorts proceeded to play an active role in seeking to obtain planning permission for the Development Project.123\n\nTr Day One 169:11-18.\n\n137.\n\nSri Lanka argues that this arrangement gives rise to an express trust by its plain terms or, alternatively, a constructive trust for Electro Resorts in respect of 50% of the profit-earning capability of the Montrose Land plus US$ 5 million.\n\n138.\n\nSri Lanka describes the Claimants\u2019 efforts to rebut the binding nature of the MOU as unavailing. Sri Lanka\u2019s case for a constructive trust on the profit-earning capability of the Montrose Land is not dependent on a binding agreement, because a reasonable certainty suffices. Further, the fact that the parties to the MOU agreed that there would be further documentation of the arrangement was not a condition precedent to the binding nature of the MOU and, indeed, the parties progressed the Development Project immediately after signing the MOU. Most important, because of the limitations in their search for MOU-related documents following the Tribunal\u2019s order, the Claimants cannot be heard to contend that the MOU was subject to ongoing negotiation and further documentation.\n\n139.\n\nOverall, according to Sri Lanka, this arrangement resonates with a Pallant-type trust, and Montrose cannot claim for the entire beneficial interest in the proceeds of the Montrose Land and deny Electro Resorts its interest. As a consequence of this express trust or, alternatively, constructive trust, Sri Lanka submits that the Claimants are not entitled to claim the full alleged earning potential of the Montrose Land.\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimants firmly reject the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the MOU to defeat jurisdiction. The Claimants contend that, to accept Sri Lanka\u2019s MOU-based argument that Electro Resorts is the real owner of the Montrose Land by operation of a Sri Lankan law trust, the Tribunal would have to ignore Mr Eyre\u2019s testimony, ignore the Deed of Transfer, ignore the fact that Electro Resorts has not challenged the Claimants\u2019 ownership of the Montrose Land for almost a decade, and \"be forced to rely on the MOU, which amounts to nothing more than an undated and non-binding agreement to agree set down on a single piece of A4 paper, to which neither Claimant is even a party\".124 According to the Claimants:\n\n*it is obvious that the MOU offers little more than a snapshot into the status of the ongoing and evolving negotiations between the parties concerning the Montrose Land. The MOU was never legally binding and was in fact superseded in the normal way by the parties' subsequent negotiations, which ultimately concluded in a significantly different structure and outcome than envisaged in the MOU.*125\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 3.\n\nRejoinder, para 206.\n\n141.\n\nCiting the Sri Lanka Supreme Court case of *Sudarshani v Herath,* the Claimants allege that Sri Lanka bears the burden of proving Electro Resorts' alleged interest in the Montrose Land *via* constructive trust, which it has failed to do.126 Sri Lanka is mistakenly relying only on the MOU in support of a constructive trust allegedly held by Electro Resorts over the Montrose Land and/or the sums of US$ 5 million and 50% of the expected profits.127\n\n*Sudarshani*, page 15 (RL-136).\n\nThe Claimants included arguments against the Respondent's alternative argument of an express trust in favor of Electro Resorts over 50% of the expected profits in their Post-Hearing Brief. The Tribunal does not address these arguments as they were excluded as untimely in Procedural Order No 6.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimants' primary defence is that the MOU carries no weight whatsoever and, in any event, is negated by the 4 August 2010 Deed of Transfer.\n\n143.\n\nUnder English law, which is the governing law of the MOU, the MOU is a non-binding \"agreement to agree\":128 it is undated and not notarised; it is entitled \"Memorandum of Understanding\" rather than \"agreement\"; it expressly anticipates the conclusion of a purchase and sale agreement, which never materialised; it provides that \"all documentation in relative to the [Development Project]... will be completed by 30 September 2010\", anticipating further agreements, which never materialised; and \"it is simply not credible that an agreement intended to govern a development project worth millions of US$ was concluded on a single piece of A4 paper\".129 The Claimants contend that the non-binding nature of the MOU is consistent with Mr Eyre's testimony that many MOUs are executed but rarely lead to actual transactions.130 Further, even if it were binding, the MOU was executed by Electro Resorts and Montrose Global, and Sri Lanka has not explained how it could bind the Claimants or overcome the clear and contrary language of the Deed of Transfer.\n\nRejoinder, paras 201-206.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 13; Exhibit R-12.3.\n\nTr Day One 158:3-14.\n\n144.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the 4 August 2010 Deed of Transfer, in comparison to the MOU, is a dated and fully notarised document which \"transferred absolute, unencumbered title to the Montrose Land and reflects the true basis on which the land was transferred to Montrose Sri Lanka\".131 In the Deed of Transfer, Electro Resorts stated that it did \"hereby expressly admit and acknowledge\" that Montrose had \"well and truly paid\" the purchase price for the Montrose Land of Rs 100 million, and that it was transferring the Montrose Land to Montrose \"free of all encumbrances and charges whatsoever\".132\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 18 (emphasis in original).\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\n145.\n\nGiven the undisputed validity of the Deed of Transfer, the Claimants reject Sri Lanka's argument that the MOU is an \"attendant circumstance\" supporting creation of a constructive trust to Electro Resorts' benefit under section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, because the Claimants allegedly never paid the purchase price under the MOU. The Claimants rely on Sri Lankan evidence law, under which \"a notarised deed represents near-incontrovertible proof of the facts set out there in\".133 In support, the Claimants again cite *Sudarshani v Herath:*\n\n*a declaration of Trust can be granted only if the Court finds that title was **not** transferred absolutely and that the parties always intended that the beneficial interest in the property will remain with the transferor. In other words, the Court has to determine that there was **no** true sale and that, therefore the deed of transfer is of **no** force or effect - i.e. that the deed of transfer is **void**.*134\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para 21; Tr Day Three 536:21-538.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 21; *Sudarshani*, page 8 (emphasis from the Claimants).\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Sri Lanka has not presented anywhere near \"incontrovertible proof\u2019 of a constructive trust. Instead, say the Claimants, the evidence before the Tribunal shows that the joint venture contemplated by the MOU was never implemented, while the Claimants did pay for the Montrose Land in accordance with the Deed of Transfer. The documentary evidence includes: (i) the 27 July 2010 Electro Resorts board resolution recording the sale and transfer of the Montrose Land for Rs 100 million, with no mention of the MOU;135 (ii) the express disavowal in the Deed of Transfer of any intention by Electro Resorts to retain a beneficial interest in the Montrose Land or any profits arising therefrom;136 (iii) the recording in the Montrose audited company accounts of Mr Eyre's having paid Rs 100 million for the Montrose Land, which debt is still recorded in the Montrose accounts;137 (iv) Electro Resorts not having made any claim for the Montrose Land, despite obtaining a valuation and making a claim for flooded land it owned nearby;138 and (v) Electro Resorts' failure to challenge the validity of the Deed of Transfer or Montrose's unencumbered title to the Montrose Land, or to seek payment for the land, for more than eight years since the date of the Deed of Transfer.\n\nExhibit C-33.\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\nExhibit R-4.\n\nTr Day One 240:17-242:16.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants describe Mr Eyre's witness evidence as consistent with the documentary record. Whilst he could not recall exactly how the purchase price for the Montrose Land had been paid, he testified adamantly that a significant portion of that payment was *via* his US$ 1,450,000 in debt forgiveness to Ravi Wethasinghe, with those debts being evidenced and secured by the Lease of 11 August 2005 and the Agreement to Finance of 13 December 2007.139\n\nExhibits C-27 and C-29.\n\n148.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that the purchase price under the Deed of Transfer was not paid to Electro Resorts, the Claimants argue against the imposition of a constructive trust. This is because Electro Resorts expressly stated in the Deed of Transfer that it intended title to the Montrose Land to pass to Montrose \"free of all encumbrances and charges whatsoever\", thereby disavowing any interest in the Montrose Land and being estopped from any claim otherwise.140 At most, Electro Resorts could attempt a claim for non-payment of the purchase price, which it would also be estopped from pursuing in light of its express admission and acknowledgement that it had been \"well and truly paid\" the purchase price of Rs 100 million.141\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\n149.\n\nIn contrast, argue the Claimants, Sri Lanka has failed to identify any evidence that the MOU was the basis for the transfer of the Montrose Land. Sri Lanka has failed to point to any document post-dating the MOU in which the MOU is mentioned, and the deal contemplated in the MOU was superseded by the different deal documented in the Deed of Transfer. As for the 23 July 2010 email from Ravi Wethasinghe to Mr Eyre referencing an MOU, which Sri Lanka alleges must have been sent before the MOU was signed, the Claimants contend that the context - in particular, use of the present tense in mentioning an MOU - suggests that the email actually post-dates the executed MOU (in the record) and was anticipating a further MOU. That further MOU apparently was not concluded and, instead, Ravi Wethasinghe and Mr Eyre proceeded to conclude the Deed of Transfer on 4 August 2010.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants also refute Sri Lanka's suggestion that, despite their allegedly owing Electro Resorts some US$ 1 million, the Claimants are collaborating with Ravi Wethasinghe behind the scenes in relation to the Hotel Project. The Claimants explain the limited ongoing connections between Mr Eyre and Ravi Wethasinghe as the result, not of the MOU, but of their owning neighboring plots of land subject to similar treatment in Sri Lanka. For example, Mr Wijeratne explained that the former government official retained by Montrose to value the Montrose Land for purposes of its claim under the Land Acquisition Act originally mistakenly put the report under Ravi Wethasinghe's name, because Ravi Wethasinghe had retained the same person to value a neighbouring plot owned by Electro Resorts. The Claimants assert that, assuming *arguendo* Sri Lanka is right that Ravi Wethasinghe has an ongoing interest in the Montrose Land under the MOU, \"it would be bizarre for him to allow the valuation to be issued without that interest being recorded\".142\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 33.2.\n\n151.\n\nFinally, the Claimants take the position that, even if Electro Resorts is found to have a beneficial interest in the Montrose Land *via* the MOU, they would still have valid claims under the BIT, for two main reasons.\n\n152.\n\nFirst, argue the Claimants, while Mr Eyre could not bring a claim on behalf of Electro Resorts as a joint venture partner, Montrose - which has legal title to the Montrose Land - has independent legal personality and is not precluded from bringing a claim in its own right. It does not assist Sri Lanka to rely on cases like *Impregilo v Pakistan,* which involved joint ventures lacking such separate legal personality.143\n\nRejoinder, paras 235-238; Tr Day Three 560:12-561:13.\n\n153.\n\nSecondly, citing *Saba Fakes v Turkey,* the Claimants insist that bare legal title to an asset - here, Montrose\u2019s legal title to the Montrose Land - is an investment for purposes of Article 1(a) of the BIT, falling within the definition of \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset\".144 As exemplified in *Occidental Petroleum v Ecuador,* rules of customary international law granting standing only to the beneficial owner of an investment do not apply to the *lex specialis* regime in the UK-Sri Lanka BIT, and Sri Lanka is wrong to argue otherwise.145 Sri Lanka is also wrong to argue that cases such as *Blue Bank v Venezuela,* where specific treaty language - in that case, that an asset had to be \"invested by the investor\" - excluded trustees from bringing claims related to assets they held in trust, are applicable in the instant case.146 That case must be distinguished because the facts there involved a professional trustee that had not made an investment in its own right, which is different from the situation of Montrose here.147\n\n*Saba Fakes*, para 134; Rejoinder, paras 239-242.\n\n*Occidental*, para 134; Tr Day 3 561:14-24.\n\n*Blue Bank*, paras 161-173.\n\nTr Day Three 563:1-566:9.\n\n**B. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B : The Montrose Land Is Not an Investment Under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1**) **of the ICSID Convention, Because the Claimants Did Not Make Any Contribution or Take Any Investment Risk**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Montrose Land - as bare land - is not a protected investment for purposes of Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and therefore the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of Montrose\u2019s claim based on the Montrose Land.\n\n155.\n\nSri Lanka bases its analysis on the ordinary meaning of the term \"investment\", utilising the *Salini* criteria and the more recent case of *Orascom v Algeria,* with focus on the attributes of contribution and risk.148 Sri Lanka rejects the Claimants\u2019 reliance on the analysis in *Philip Morris v Uruguay,* in which the tribunal, in Sri Lanka\u2019s view, erroneously relied on the fact that the term \"investment\" in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention was compromise language amongst the treaty parties and went on to infer that there should be wide leeway to find jurisdiction.149 Citing to Professor Schreuer\u2019s commentary, Sri Lanka says that the reason the compromise language was introduced into Article 25(1) was because the treaty parties could not agree on a definition.150 Under the circumstances, the correct approach is to interpret Article 25(1) applying the principles of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\") in order to give the term \"investment\" its ordinary meaning without speculating on the treaty parties\u2019 intentions.\n\n*Salini* (CL-26); *Orascom v Algeria*, ICSID Case No ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, paras 370-371 (RL-79).\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 32; *Philip Morris v Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/07, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 July 2013 (\"***Philip Morris***\"), para 198 (CL-96).\n\nC Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed, 2009) (\"**Schreuer**\"), page 128 (RL-7).\n\n156.\n\nSri Lanka also rejects the Claimants\u2019 assertion that they do not have to prove contribution to the Montrose Land, as it is sufficient to prove contribution to the Hotel Project under principles of unity of investment. Sri Lanka describes this as \"misconceived\", because to rely upon principles of unity of investment, the Claimants would have to prove that the overall Hotel Project constituted a qualifying investment under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which they cannot do because the Montrose Land remains bare land.151 The Claimants neither had planning permission nor had entered into any contractual commitments for development of the land. If they had had such contractual commitments, they perhaps could have relied on them as constituting an investment under Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT as a claim to money or performance and also under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and then relied on that investment as subsuming within it the sub-components for the Hotel Project. Sri Lanka challenges the Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Inmaris v Ukraine,* on grounds that, in that case, the relevant overall operation of a Bareboat Charter Contract constituted an investment as \"claims to performance\" under the relevant treaty, with the various sub-contracts being subsumed in the operations.152\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 33; *Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH & Ors v Ukraine*, ICSID ARB/08/08, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2010 (\"***Inmaris***\"), para 92 (CL-72).\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 33;\n\n157.\n\nWith only aspirational intentions for the Hotel Project, the Claimants\u2019 activities constituted only pre-investment activities. Citing *Romak v Uzbekistan,* Sri Lanka argues that, by definition, the Claimants took no investment risk with respect to such aspirational hotel development because they had not yet paid for or committed to pay any funds.153\n\n*Romak SA Switzerland v Republic of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No AA/280, Award, 26 November 2009 (\"***Romak***\"), paras 228-231 (RL-25).\n\n158.\n\nFurther, Sri Lanka argues on several grounds that the Claimants did not make any contribution to the Montrose Land and hence incurred no investment risk.\n\n159.\n\nFirst, Montrose itself made no payment to acquire the land.\n\n160.\n\nSecondly, to rely on the alleged historical loan payments made by Mr Eyre to Ravi Wethasinghe as a contribution to the Montrose Land, the Claimants would need to demonstrate that: (a) the loans had actually been made and not repaid; and (b) there was an agreement that the debts arising would be part of the consideration for the Montrose Land. Sri Lanka contends that the Claimants can demonstrate neither. As to the alleged payment of US$ 350,000 pursuant to a financing agreement of 13 December 2007, there is no evidence of a drawdown request, payment or any chaser for payment. As to the alleged loan of US$ 1 million in 2003, there is no evidence of the terms, payment or any chaser for payment and, insofar as Mr Eyre relies on the 2005 lease agreement, the terms reflect that only Rs 30 million (less than US$ 200,000) was paid and even that payment is not correlated to the alleged US$ 1 million loan amount. Relying again on the MOU and the anticipatory email of 23 July 2010, Sri Lanka argues that the only relevant evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates that these alleged loan payments formed no part of the consideration for the Montrose Land.\n\n161.\n\nThirdly, Sri Lanka denies that the US$ 400,000 paid by Mr Eyre (through Montrose Aircraft Leasing) to Ravi Wethasinghe on 5 July 2010 can constitute consideration for the Montrose Land, because it was paid in the context only of the planning approval process for the Hotel Project and so was not related to the Montrose Land. Sri Lanka asserts further that the planning approval process could require US$ 400,000, and so suggests that the payment was more likely a \"personal fund to Mr Wethasinghe as a quid pro quo for Mr Wethasinghe assisting in getting a clean title report\".154\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 38.\n\n162.\n\nFinally, Sri Lanka alleges that Montrose \"was merely the holding vehicle established to avoid paying 100% sales tax otherwise payable for the acquisition of the Land\" and therefore \"was in no sense the active investor\".155 Applying the test developed by the President of the tribunal in *SCB v Tanzania* that Article 8(1) of the United Kingdom-Tanzania BIT required \"an active relationship between the investor and the investment\", the Montrose Land was not a protected investment of Montrose under Article 8(1) of the BIT.156\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 39.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 39; *SCB v Tanzania*, paras 199 and 230.\n\n163.\n\nSri Lanka flatly rejects the Claimants\u2019 justification based on the \"economic reality\" of the transaction, charging a \"double standard\":\n\n*The Respondent fails to understand how a good faith interpretation of the BIT permits the Claimant to evade sales tax by not overtly presenting itself as a foreign national, and at the same time rely upon the alleged economic reality of the foreign actor behind the company to then gain the benefit of the BIT.*157\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 40(a).\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Claimants describe as \"untenable\" Sri Lanka's arguments that, first, they have not made active contributions to the Montrose Land and assumed risk in Sri Lanka so as to have made an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, applying the relevant *Salini* criteria and, second, they are not active investors under Article 8(1) of the BIT within the meaning of *SCB v Tanzania.*158\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 60; Rejoinder, paras 274-278.\n\n165.\n\nAlthough the Claimants included the *Salini* factors in the jurisdictional case in their Memorial, they nonetheless argue that the \"so-called *\u2018Salini* factors' are a treaty interpretation dead-end that should never have been implied into the ICSID Convention\".159 According to the Claimants, to the extent the term \"investment\" has any autonomous meaning in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, it is merely to exclude obviously absurd claims of investment.160 Citing *Philip Morris v Uruguay,* the Claimants explain that the drafters of the ICSID Convention left \"investment\" undefined, due to the difference of views between capital-importing and capital-exporting States.161 Accordingly, the Tribunal should respect the broad definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(a) of the BIT and recognise the Claimants' investment in the Montrose Land.\n\nRejoinder, section VIII.C(1); Tr Day Three 517:1-520:3; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 62.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 91-92.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 92; *Philip Morris*, para 198.\n\n166.\n\nAs for the active investment test in *SCB v Tanzania,* the Claimants contend that the reasoning of the President of the tribunal in that case was wrong, \"relying on a stilted reading of the word \u2018of' as it appears [in the phrase \u2018disputes... concerning an investment of a foreign national or company] in Article 8(1) of the BIT to imply a requirement of \u2018active' investment as a precondition to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae\"*162 The correct position, argue the Claimants, is that of the *CEMEX v Venezuela* tribunal, which interpreted the word \"of\u2019 to connote mere possession of an investment, including indirect investment.163\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 63; Counter-Memorial, paras 59-67.\n\n*CEMEX Caracas Investments BV & CEMEX Caracas II Investments BV v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/08/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 December 2010, para 157 (CL-151).\n\n167.\n\nIn any event, argue the Claimants, there is ample evidence in the record that they made active contributions and incurred risk sufficient to meet both the *Salini* factors and the *SCB v Tanzania* test.164 Mr Eyre was the directing mind behind the incorporation of Montrose to purchase and hold the Montrose Land and serves as director; and he liaised with advisors in Sri Lanka, financial institutions, hotel management companies, hotel planning consultants and architects to implement the Hotel Project on the Montrose Land.165 Mr Eyre paid: (a) US$ 1,450,000, by way of debt forgiveness to Ravi Wethasinghe, as consideration for the Montrose Land; (b) stamp duty and professional fees in relation to the transfer of the Montrose Land to Montrose; and (c) the US$ 400,000 through Montrose Aircraft Leasing to procure clean title to the Montrose Land.166 Montrose also contributed to the Montrose Land by entering into the Deed of Transfer, owning the Montrose Land over an extended period of time, serving as the entity through which the Hotel Project was implemented, and pursuing the claim for compensation for the Montrose Land after it was flooded.167\n\nRejoinder, paras 309-313.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 65, citing Exhibits C-37 through C-40, C-59, C-94, C-98;

Tr Day Two 436:4- 447:24; Tr Day Three 515:3-14.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants charge Sri Lanka with disconnecting these substantial contributions from economic reality. Insofar as Sri Lanka contends that it was Montrose Global and Montrose Aircraft Leasing, rather than the Claimants, which made the relevant contributions, the Claimants explain that, as is common in business, Mr Eyre uses Montrose Global as \"corporate shorthand for his name and activities\u2019 and as a \"common corporate brand that may have given greater credibility to the Hotel Project than if Mr Eyre presented himself to third parties as a private individual\".168 Given that Mr Eyre owns every entity in the Montrose Group, \"from the economic standpoint that the BIT prioritizes over corporate personality, Mr Eyre can claim contributions made by Montrose Global as his own\".169\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 67; Tr Day Two 341:22-348:8.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 67 (footnote omitted); First Eyre Statement, paras 7-10.\n\n169.\n\nInsofar as Sri Lanka identifies many of the contributions, in particular the US$ 400,000 payment related to the title search, as not going towards the Montrose Land but rather to the Hotel Project, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal must consider their investments as a whole. Relying on *Inmaris v Ukraine* in support of the concept of \"unity of investment\" for jurisdictional purposes, the Claimants argue that the Montrose Land and the Hotel Project cannot be treated as separate investments.170 As proof that their intention at all stages was to acquire the Montrose Land for the purpose of the Hotel Project, the Claimants quote the statement of purpose in the Montrose Articles of Association: \"To carry on the business of hotels and hotel services\" and \"To carry on the development of hotels and managing hotels\".171\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 68; Counter-Memorial, paras 102-108; *Inmaris*, para 92.\n\nExhibit C-88.\n\n**VII. PRELIMINARY JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS: THE SHAREHOLDER LEVEL**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Preliminary Objection C : Any Alleged Shareholder Claim Is Dependent Upon the Land Constituting an Asset of Montrose, Which It Is Not**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s main argument at the \"shareholder level\" is that the shareholder claims are \"parasitical\" to the claim by Montrose as the company through which a shareholder must claim, \"whether as indirect shareholder, alleged beneficiary of shares, and/or otherwise\".172 The shareholder claims are necessarily jurisdictionally dependent upon the extent to which the Montrose Land constitutes a protected investment of Montrose -which, for the reasons supporting its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections A and B, it is not.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 41.\n\n171.\n\nSri Lanka rejects the Claimants\u2019 defensive assertion, made without any authority, that this objection goes only to the value of the shareholder claims and hence is a matter only of admissibility. As it is well-established in principle, in for example, *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka v Hellenic Republic,* that a shareholder cannot make a claim in respect of the assets of the relevant company, it must follow that a shareholder lacks standing to claim for alleged loss of shareholder value that is not based on company assets.173\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 42; *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka*, paras 230-246.\n\nB. **Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection D : Indirect Shareholders Are Not Covered by Article 1(a****)(ii**) **of the BIT; a Locally Incorporated Company Does Not Take the Nationality of the Indirect Shareholder Under Article 8(2**) **of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent fundamentally disagrees with the Claimants\u2019 jurisdictional claim that, because Article 1(a) of the BIT refers to \"every kind of asset\", any asset whether directly or indirectly held and whether or not listed in Article 1(a)(i)-(v), falls within the definition. Again relying on *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka v Hellenic Republic* for propositions of treaty interpretation under the VCLT, Sri Lanka argues that, despite the broad asset-based definition of investment in the BIT, the list of categories following that broad definition must be given specific meaning to avoid redundancy.\n\n173.\n\nThe relevant category here is Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT, which includes in the definition of investment \"Shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property *of such companies\"* (emphasis added). Sri Lanka argues that, on proper interpretation of the clause, the \"shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property\" must be directly \"*of such companies*\" (emphasis added). As the word \"companies\" is defined in Article 1(d)(ii) of the BIT as the relevant locally incorporated company, the protected shares must be shares of Montrose as a Sri Lankan company. Further, given that Article 1(a)(ii) specifically covers an \"interest in *property* of such companies\") but not an interest in *shares* of such companies\" (emphasis added), the Article necessarily here excludes Mr Eyre\u2019s indirect shareholding interest in Montrose (through Montrose Singapore) because such shareholding reflects only his *interest in* the Montrose Share as opposed to ownership of the Montrose Share itself. It is Montrose Singapore that owns the Montrose Share, and Montrose Singapore is not a qualifying investor.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent urges the Tribunal, under Article 32 of the VCLT, to have regard here to supplementary means of interpretation to confirm the meaning of Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT under Article 31. In specific, Sri Lanka relies heavily on a Foreign Commonwealth Office (\"**FCO**\") Memorandum of 21 February 1973 *(\"**FCO Memorandum**\")* commenting on the 1972 UK Model BIT, which the Parties agree was the model for the BIT.174 The definition of investment in Article 1(a)(ii) of the 1972 UK Model BIT differs, by referring to:\n\n*Shares, stock and debentures of companies **wherever incorporated** or interests in the property of such companies.*175\n\nFCO Commentary on the 1972 UK Model BIT, under cover of FCO Memo dated 21 February 1973 (\"**FCO Memorandum**\") (RL-54).\n\nFinal Model IPPA under cover of FCO Memorandum dated 7 July 1972 (RL-53) (emphasis added).\n\n175.\n\nThe FCO commented that the words \"wherever incorporated\" were included to cover shareholders in companies \"incorporated in any third State\", because customary international law does not provide the United Kingdom the right to protect shareholders incorporated in third states, as opposed to UK shareholders in UK companies and companies in the other Contracting State, absent specific drafting protection. Sri Lanka contends that, in making this reference to the customary international law position in 1973, the FCO clearly had the recent judgment in *Barcelona Traction* in mind and, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 suggestion, *Barcelona Traction* cannot be ignored as a diplomatic protection case.176 If indirect shareholdings were already covered, says Sri Lanka, then the specific words \"wherever incorporated\" would not have been necessary in the UK 1972 Model BIT.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 54; *Barcelona Traction Light and Power Co. Ltd. (Belg. v. Spain), 1970 ICJ 3,* 5 February 1970 (2nd Phase) (RL-57).\n\n176.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Sri Lanka did not include the allegedly critical words \"wherever incorporated\" in Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT. Sri Lanka contends that this implies that the concept - the extension of protection to investments of companies incorporated in third states - was rejected. This adds further support to Sri Lanka's interpretation of Article 1(a)(ii), because:\n\n*it is unrealistic to suppose that the wording to extend the catchment area of the BIT was dropped because it was not needed: the UK thought it was needed so why on earth would Sri Lanka agree to its removal on the basis that it was not needed as opposed to not agreeing to extend the catchment area.*177\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 54(d).\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to argue that this interpretation is reinforced by reference to Article 5(2) and Article 8(2) of the BIT, which the Respondent says provide context for the interpretation of Article 1(a)(ii). These Articles provide:\n\n*Article 5(2)*\n\n*Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and **in which** nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party **own** shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of the investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party who are **owners** of those shares. (Emphasis added)*\n\n*Article 8(2)*\n\n*A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and **in which** before such dispute arises the majority of shares are **owned** by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with article 25(2)(b) of the [ICSID] Convention be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party. (Emphasis added)*\n\n178.\n\nSri Lanka states that Article 5(2) was \"drafted with specific regard to the limited exception envisaged by *Barcelona Traction* in which a shareholder in the company could bring an indirect claim in respect of the expropriation of the assets of the company\".178 Sri Lanka emphasises that Article 5(2) refers to assets of a company *\"in which\"* a person or entity *\"owns* shares\" and is the *\"owner* of those shares\"; while Article 8(2) refers to the majority of shares in a company \"*in which\"* shares \"are *owned\"* by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Looking at ordinary meaning, the Respondent contends that these two provisions only confer (in the case of Article 5(2)) rights and (in the case of Article 8(2)) nationality for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention on the person or entity who actually *owns* the shares *in* the relevant company. Citing to Professor Douglas, Sri Lanka takes the position that an indirect shareholder does not *own* shares in the company and so, here, Mr Eyre does not *own* the Montrose Share, even if his indirect shareholding provides him with control of Montrose.179\n\nReply, para 63.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 48; Z Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge University Press, 2009) pages 197-198 (CL-196).\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent puts particular emphasis on Article 8(2) of the BIT, which it says defines the circumstances in which the Contracting States consented to a locally incorporated company taking the nationality of the other Contracting State for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Citing to *Vacuum Salt v Ghana,* Sri Lanka takes the position that Article 25(2)(b) sets an \"objective limit (of foreign control) beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist\" and, here, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom \"did not opt for the outer limit of control by simply agreeing to Article 25(2)(b) but chose a narrower definition of equity ownership\".180 Given that the UK-Sri Lanka BIT does not use the language of \"ownership or control (directly or indirectly)\" used in other treaties, for example, the Romania-Sweden BIT interpreted by the tribunal in *Micula v Romania,* the Claimants\u2019 reliance on awards interpreting such broader language cannot assist their jurisdictional case under the more limited BIT language here.181\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 49(b); *Vacuum Salt Products Ltd v Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No ARB/92/01, Award, 16 February 1994 (\"***Vacuum Salt***\"), para 36 (CL-128).\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, paras 49-50; *Micula v Romania*, ICSID Case No ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008 (RL-97).\n\n180.\n\nNor, argues Sri Lanka, are the Claimants assisted by the case they must rely upon in this context, *SCB v Tanzania.* The United Kingdom-Tanzania BIT in that case does include in the definition of \"investment\" the same category of \"Shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property of such companies\" as appears in Article 1(a)(ii) of the UK-Sri Lanka BIT here, but Sri Lanka disputes that the tribunal in *SCB v Tanzania* determined that an *indirect* shareholding was covered by this definition. Sri Lanka emphasises that the tribunal left open that question without analyzing any of the specific terms in the definition:\n\n*For good order, the Tribunal clarifies that it does **not** find that the UK-Tanzania BIT applies only to direct as opposed to indirect investments. Emphasis added. Such a conclusion is not necessary to the decision here. The Tribunal leaves the question to be addressed by a tribunal in a case in which the issue is essential to the decision to be made.*182\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 51; *SCB v Tanzania*, paras 240, 266.\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimants maintain their position that, with a proper interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT, the ICSID Convention and the BIT, Montrose and Mr Eyre have standing as qualifying investors.183\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 29.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants describe Sri Lanka's overall objection that Article 1(a) of the BIT does not protect Mr Eyre's indirect legal ownership of the Montrose Share as misconceived, and contrary to the many tribunal decisions recognising indirect shareholder claims where the relevant treaty defines \"investment\" broadly as \"every kind of asset\".184 The Claimants criticise Sri Lanka for offering interpretations of the BIT that are based on \"misconceived references to Sri Lankan law derived from the ICJ's judgment in *Barcelona Traction,* which is irrelevant in the investment treaty context\"; that are an \"anathema to the object and purpose of the BIT\"; and that violate the general rule of international law that a tribunal should not import a requirement limiting its jurisdiction when the parties have not specified such a requirement in the relevant treaty.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 5.\n\n183.\n\nAs for Article 1(a) of the BIT, the Claimants' primary response is that Sri Lanka is wrong to focus on the *illustration* of an \"investment\" in Article 1(a)(ii) - \"Shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property of such companies\" - to assert that the concept of indirect shareholding is missing. Instead, argue the Claimants, the focus must remain on the *definition* of \"investment\" itself in the opening language of Article 1(a) - \"every kind of asset\" - without any qualifier that an asset be \"directly\" held. Such a broad definition must include assets held directly or indirectly, to fulfill the purpose of investment treaties \"to give investors the widest possible protection\".185 In support, the Claimants cite to a statement by the United Kingdom's FCO that this language \"is deliberately non-exhaustive so that the [BIT] will have the ***widest possible coverage**\"* and this is *\"**essentia**l\"* to the functioning of the treaty.186\n\nRejoinder, para 25.\n\nRejoinder, para 26; Letter from the FCO to Clifford Chance LLP (16 November 2007), cited in C Brown and A Sheppard, \"United Kingdom\", in C Brown (ed), *Commentaries on Selected Model Bilateral Investment Treaties* (OUP 2013) 697, 711 (CL-93) (emphasis from Claimants).\n\n184.\n\nGiven the Claimants' focus on the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(a) of the BIT rather than the illustrative example in Article 1(a)(ii), they give short shrift to the Respondent's reliance on the FCO Memorandum of 21 February 1973 commenting on Article 1(a)(ii) in the 1972 UK Model BIT. Further, even if the United Kingdom provided the 1972 UK Model BIT to Sri Lanka during the BIT negotiations and it became part of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* the Claimants assert that the same cannot be said for the FCO Memorandum. Even if the FCO Memorandum could properly be used to interpret the BIT under Article 31 and, as a supplementary interpretation tool, Article 32 of the VCLT, it is \"not a direct source for understanding the object and purpose of the BIT\" and is \"a partisan document separate from the BIT and indeed drafted some seven years prior to the execution of the BIT\".187\n\nRejoinder, para 36 (emphasis from Claimants).\n\n185.\n\nIn any event, argue the Claimants, Sri Lanka has \"clearly misunderstood the FCO Memorandum\" in contending that it shows that the 1972 UK Model BIT attempted to codify customary international law, given that the purpose of a BIT is to create a *lex specialis.188* Further, Sri Lanka has made a \"fundamental error\" in \"conflat[ing] the rule in *Barcelona Traction* with the concept of indirect shareholder claims\".189\n\nRejoinder, para 49, and paras 48-50.\n\nRejoinder, para 55, and paras 51-57.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants similarly reject Sri Lanka's arguments based on Article 5(2) of the BIT, which were also based on *Barcelona Traction* and the FCO Memorandum to the effect that Article 5(2) limits Mr Eyre's ability to bring an indirect claim arising from losses suffered by Montrose. The Claimants disagree and rely on the FCO Memorandum to support their position that Article 5(2) is designed to protect against the indirect expropriation of an investment vehicle whether or not that vehicle is itself the investment, leaving the shares functionally worthless even though the investor retains title to the shares.190\n\nRejoinder, paras 73-74; FCO Memorandum, para 10 (RL-54).\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants further rely on *RosInvest v Russia,* where they say the tribunal found that the sole purpose of Article 5(2) (in that case, in the United Kingdom-United Soviet Socialist Republic BIT) is to clarify that indirect expropriation claims are available to shareholders in relation to their shares when company assets are expropriated.191 The Claimants contend this was also decided in *AAPL v Sri Lanka,* in which a shareholder brought a reflective loss claim \"in precisely the circumstances that Sri Lanka now attempts to exclude\" and was compensated for the lost value of its 48% shareholding in the Sri Lankan company destroyed in the Sri Lanka civil war.192\n\nRejoinder, para 146; *RosInvestCo UK Ltd v Russian Federation*, SCC Case No V079/2005, Final Award, 12 September 2010 (\"***RosInvest***\"), para 608 (CL-79).\n\nRejoinder, para 147; *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka* (1990) 4 ICSID Rep 245, Award, 27 June 1990 (\"***AAPL***\"), paras 95-108 (CL-182).\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants similarly reject Sri Lanka's argument that Montrose cannot be deemed a UK national under Article 8(2) of the BIT because Mr Eyre does not directly own the Montrose Share. In the Claimants' words:\n\n*Article 8(2) merely allows a locally incorporated investment vehicle - which may have suffered a distinct loss from its direct or indirect owner - to bring a claim in its own right in conjunction with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It says nothing about whether the BIT protects indirect shareholders nor restrict their claims.*193\n\nRejoinder, para 91.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants maintain the position taken in their Memorial that the purpose of Article 8(2) is to serve as a declaration for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.194\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 38.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants firmly disagree with the Respondent\u2019s argument that Article 25(2)(b) sets a lower limit or floor on ICSID jurisdiction, contending that it rather \"is intended to expand the scope of ICSID jurisdiction, not to narrow it\".195 Article 25(2)(b), the Claimants say, is designed to avoid having an investment vehicle incorporated in the host State, but controlled by a national of the other Contracting State, from being treated as a national of the host State, which would be an exercise of \"prioritising corporate form over economic reality\".196 Article 25(2)(b) gives ICSID Member States the capacity to consent - as Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom did here, in the BIT - that a company incorporated in one may be considered to hold the nationality of the other, \"so long as an autonomous and objective standard of *foreign control* inherent to Article 25(2)(b) is met\".197 The Claimants cite Professor Schreuer in support:\n\n*Whereas the first part of Art. 25(2)(b) merely refers to an investor's nationality, the second part specifically refers to control. This would indicate an approach that is governed less by formal aspects of corporate nationality than by economic realities. Therefore, on balance, the better approach would appear to be a realistic look at the true controllers thereby blocking access to the Centre for juridical persons that are controlled directly or indirectly by nationals of non-Contracting States or nationals of host States.*198\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 32 (emphasis in original).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 32.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 32.\n\n*Schreue* r, page 323.\n\n191.\n\nFurther, the Claimants disagree with the Respondent\u2019s position that control must be exercised by the majority shareholder that directly owns the relevant shareholding. They argue that the requirement of *direct* ownership and control is not found in the text of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and therefore the Contracting States did not intend to exclude indirect ownership of a controlling interest by a UK national like Mr Eyre from the scope of Article 8(2). The tribunal in *Plama v Bulgaria,* in interpreting the words \"investment [...] owned\" in Article 17(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty, held that:\n\n*ownership includes indirect and beneficial ownership; and control includes control in fact, including an ability to exercise substantial influence over the legal entity's management, operations, and the selection of members of its board of directors or any other managing body.*199\n\nFor the Tribunal here to read a requirement of only direct ownership into the BIT would be contrary to the \"well-known\" rule of international law, as set out in *Bear Creek Mining v Peru,* that a tribunal should not import a requirement limiting its jurisdiction when the parties have not specified that requirement.200\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005 (\"***Plama***\"), para 170 (CL-43).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 5; Rejoinder, paras 136-139; *Bear Creek Mining Corp v Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No ARB/14/21, Award, 30 November 2017 (\"***Bear Creek Mining***\"), para 320 (CL-176).\n\n192.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants reject Sri Lanka's interpretive argument that the words \"in which\" in Article 8(2) provide the same meaning as the word \"directly\". As a matter of ordinary meaning, the words \"in which\" do not change the fact that, to fulfill the purpose of Article 8(2), the shares may be directly or indirectly \"owned\".201 In this context, the Claimants agree with the Respondent that *SCB v Tanzania* is of little use to the Tribunal in interpreting Article 8(2).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 39.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants describe it as \"common ground\" that Mr Eyre exercised legal and factual control over Montrose, given his 99% stake in Montrose Singapore (with his wife holding the other 1%), which was the legal owner of the Montrose Share when this arbitration was commenced. This is effectively the 100% foreign ownership that the tribunal in *Vacuum Salt v Ghana* found, in the context of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, \"almost certainly would result in foreign control, by whatever standard\".202\n\n*Vacuum Salt*, para 43.\n\n194.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants argue that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(2) of the BIT must be interpreted to prevent corporate legal personality from interfering with the real economic interests of the investment - and \"the \u2018real\u2019 economic interest behind Montrose Sri Lanka is Mr Eyre\".203 Further, as Mr Eyre is entitled to claim his indirect ownership of the Montrose Share as a qualified investment under the broad definition in Article 1(a) of the BIT, Montrose is entitled to rely on that indirect ownership to be deemed a UK national under Article 8(2).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 9 citing *CMS v Argentina*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/08, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, para 51 (CL-133).\n\n**C. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection E : Mr Eyre\u2019s Alleged Beneficial Interest in the Share Is Not Protected by the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(**1**) **The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nRepeating the interpretive analysis set out in support of its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection based on *indirect* ownership of shares, the Respondent asserts that the BIT does not protect Mr Eyre\u2019s alleged *beneficial* interest in the Montrose Share.\n\n196.\n\nSri Lanka dismisses the cases relied upon by the Claimants for the contrary position on grounds that the specific wording in the treaties involved is broader than that in Article 1(a) of the UK-Sri Lanka BIT. In *Saba Fakes v Turkey,* the Netherlands-Turkey BIT includes in the definition of investment \"shares of stock or *other interests* in a company\" and provides that investments may be \"owned *or controlled*\" by investors (emphasis added).204 In *Plama v Bulgaria,* the tribunal held that the Energy Charter Treaty defines investment to mean \"every kind of asset owned *or controlled directly or indirectly* by an investor and includes: (b) shares, stocks or *other forms of equity participation in a company*\" (emphasis added).205\n\n*Saba Fakes* ; Netherlands-Turkey BIT, Article 1(b)(ii), 1(d) and 2 (RL-106).\n\n*Plama* ; Energy Charter Treaty, Article 1(6) (RL-19).\n\n197.\n\nIn any event, argues the Respondent, Mr Eyre did not have the necessary beneficial interest in the shares of Montrose Singapore, the holder of the Montrose Share. To establish such a beneficial interest, Mr Eyre must prove that: (i) at the Montrose level, Mr Fernando held the Montrose Share on trust for Mr Eyre; and (2) at the Montrose Singapore level, Montrose Singapore held its shares in Montrose on trust for Mr Eyre, following the transfer of the Montrose Share from Mr Fernando. Mr Eyre, says Sri Lanka, has failed to prove the beneficial interest on either basis.\n\n198.\n\nAt the Montrose level, the Respondent contends that Sri Lankan legal principles must apply to the creation of a valid trust between Mr Eyre and Mr Fernando. Articles 3, 6 and 10 of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance require proof that Mr Eyre intended to create a trust of the Montrose Share vis-\u00e0-vis Mr Fernando and that Mr Fernando agreed to act as trustee. Citing *Pandit v Maheshri,* Sri Lanka argues that proof of such intention and agreement requires clear evidence and cautions the Tribunal against accepting oral evidence of interested parties.206\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 59; *Madhavprasad Nanuram Pandit v Monghilal Ramandand Maheshri* (1927) BOM 161 (RL-113). The Respondent notes that this is an Indian case, and the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance is based on the Indian Trust Act of 1882.\n\n199.\n\nSri Lanka emphasises that the only evidence of the alleged Montrose trust is just such oral evidence of interested parties - Mr Eyre and his fellow Montrose director, Mr Wijeratne. In the absence of any written trust arrangement, Mr Eyre testified that he left it to local lawyers to advise and create a trust and he did not recall instructing Mr Wijeratne to appoint Mr Fernando as trustee.207 In Sri Lanka's view, if Mr Eyre really had instructed local lawyers to create a trust, there would have been a document. The only evidence of legal advice was Ms Mudalige's email suggesting that Mr Eyre have a local director for Montrose, with arrangements to remove the director at will by obtaining the signed resignation letter from Mr Fernando.208 Further, says Sri Lanka, a trust of shares would have been \"ill-advised\" because it would have been void under Sections 4(1)(b) and 4(2) of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance as an illegitimate attempt to evade and \"defeat the purpose\" of the 100% sales tax imposed by Section 58(3)(A) of the Finance Act No 11 of 1963.209\n\nTr Day One 196:1-15, 19-25; 197:11-25; 198:1-6.\n\nExhibit R-12.5; Exhibit C-85.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 63(b), citing RL-42 and RL-3.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent describes Mr Wijeratne's testimony as being equally unreliable. Among other reasons, Mr Wijeratne is in the tourism business and is not a lawyer, and had no familiarity with the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance or any experience in creating a trust.210 At the highest, he recalled that Mr Eyre wanted to \"have control\" of Montrose and asked him to find \"a trusted person\" as director, and that he therefore recommended Mr Fernando and obtained the undated signed resignation letter from Mr Fernando.211 Under cross-examination at the hearing, he recounted that Mr Fernando also provided a blank signed shareholder transfer document, but the Claimants produced no such document.212\n\nTr Day One 223:19-21; 230:11-17.\n\nTr Day One 227:13-16; 230:1-10.\n\nTr Day One 235:3-4\n\n201.\n\nTurning next to the Montrose Singapore level, the Respondent contends that there is no evidence whatsoever - not even oral testimony from Mr Eyre - that Montrose Singapore agreed to act as trustee in respect of the Montrose Share. Although the Claimants suggest that this was simply a question of transferring an existing Sri Lankan trust to a new trustee, the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance provides that \"[n]o one is bound to accept a trust\".213 What the Claimants must prove, therefore, is that Montrose Singapore had knowledge of the trust and agreed to be bound by it.\n\nSri Lankan Trust Ordinance, section 10(2) (RL-42).\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent charges the Claimants with patently failing to meet this burden of proof. Mr Eyre testified that he was not aware of any trust at the Montrose level, and there is no way to impute knowledge of any existing trust to Montrose Singapore. Nor, on his evidence, did Mr Eyre give any thought as to whether the Montrose Share should be held on trust for him by Montrose Singapore in addition to his having 99% of the Montrose Singapore shareholding.214 To be compliant with the Singapore Companies Act and the Articles of Association of Montrose Singapore, there should have been a Board Resolution regarding the trust - and the Claimants produced no such document.215 Further, given the conflict of interest posed by the trust, the Articles of Association call for an ordinary shareholders\u2019 resolution - and again the Claimants produced no such document.216 The Claimants may object that failure to comply with the Singapore Companies Act and the Article of Association of Montrose Singapore does not invalidate a trust, but, says Sri Lanka, \"this is to convert a factual point into a legal point\" and the \"absence of any board and shareholder resolutions and minutes and the positive absence of any intention to act as trustee strongly rebuts the contention\" that such a trust was created.217\n\nTr Day One 206:11-17.\n\nSingapore Companies Act, section 157A (RL-128); Memorandum of Articles of Association of Montrose Singapore (\"**Montrose Singapore Articles**\"), sections 77, 83 and 90 (R-14).\n\nMontrose Singapore Articles, sections 81(A) and (C).\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 67(d).\n\n203.\n\nFurther, argues the Respondent, Mr Eyre had an obligation under the Singapore Companies Act to disclose his alleged beneficial interest in Montrose at the time the shareholding was transferred, with the failure to disclose constituting a criminal offense.218 Given Mr Eyre\u2019s insistence that he always relied on local legal advice, the \"reality\" is that he was not advised to make such a disclosure in Singapore because \"he never had any intention of creating or transferring a trust in the shares and did not give this a moment\u2019s thought\".219\n\nSingapore Companies Act, section 156 (RL-128).\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 67(e).\n\n204.\n\nFinally, the Respondent points out that the 2014 accounts of Montrose Singapore are \"fundamentally inconsistent with the existence of a trust which fundamentally negates that contention on a factual level\".220 There is no disclosure in the accounts of Mr Eyre\u2019s beneficial interest,221 which would imply that the accounts failed to give a true and fair view of the financial position of Montrose Singapore in violation of the Singapore Companies Act and the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (\"**SFRS**\").222 The accounts were prepared on a consolidated basis on the ground of the exercise of control by Montrose Singapore over Montrose and a right to a return from its holding in Montrose, but there is no such return right in a trust223 and, under Singapore law, a company cannot assert control over another company where shares are held on trust.224\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 67(f).\n\nMontrose Singapore's Financial Year End 31 December 2014 Accounts, Exhibit R-4.\n\nSingapore Companies Act, section 201(5) (RL-128); Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (\"**SFRS**\") 1, 110, 112 (Exhibit 2.1 to Expert Report of Narissa Chen).\n\nSFRS 110, Appendix (definition of control).\n\nSingapore Companies Act, section 5(3) (RL-128).\n\n205.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent argues that it is \"implausible and inconsistent with Mr Eyre's own evidence to suggest - as the Claimants hypothesis - that \"Mr Eyre was not aware of any of his statutory responsibilities\" with regard to a Montrose Singapore trust. Instead, says Sri Lanka:\n\n*The reason why he gave this no thought was simply that he never considered himself to have an interest beyond his 99% shareholding, which explains why it was never considered, voted upon or otherwise acted upon.*225\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 67(g).\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nAs with their answer to Sri Lanka's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection based on indirect ownership of the Montrose Share, the Claimants primarily rely on the broad definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(a) of the BIT to refute Sri Lanka's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection based on Mr Eyre's alleged beneficial ownership of the Montrose Share. Article 1(a) defines \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset\" and, according to the Claimants, \"[i]t is beyond argument that beneficial title to shares is an \u2018asset'\".226\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 7.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimants argue further that Article 1(a)(1) includes \"property rights\" as an illustration of a covered investment and, given that Sri Lankan law recognises beneficial ownership of a share as a property right, Mr Eyre's beneficial ownership of the Montrose Share *ipso facto* fulfils this requirement. They rely on the Trusts Ordinance, which recognises that shares can be held on trust without entry into the company register and the resulting beneficial interest is enforceable.227\n\nTr Day Three 524:22-544:9.\n\n208.\n\nIn further support, and following on from its arguments under Article 8(2) of the BIT, the Claimants rely on other tribunal decisions. As noted in connection with the Claimants\u2019 indirect ownership claim, the tribunal in *Plama v Bulgaria* interpreted the word \"owned\" in Article 17(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty to include \"beneficial ownership\".228 In *Saba Fakes v Turkey,* the tribunal found:\n\n*the division of property rights amongst several persons or the separation of legal and beneficial ownership is commonly accepted in a number of legal systems, be it through a trust, fiduciary or other similar structure.... The separation of legal title and beneficial ownership rights does not deprive such ownership of the characteristics of an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT.* 229\n\n*Plama*, para 170.\n\n*Saba Fakes*, para 134.\n\n209.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the tribunals in *Plama v Bulgaria* and *Saba Fakes v Turkey* were interpreting broader language contained in the relevant BITs, the Claimants point out that the language at issue went to illustrations of covered investments, while the Claimants here are relying on the definition of \"investment\" itself in the UK-Sri Lanka BIT - the broad phrase \"every kind of asset\".230\n\nRejoinder, para 172.\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants argue further that Mr Eyre is in fact the beneficial owner of the Montrose Share.\n\n211.\n\nStarting first with Montrose, the Claimants contend that the evidence clearly shows that Mr Fernando was only a nominee director and shareholder, subject to Mr Eyre\u2019s control and to removal by Mr Eyre at any time.231 This evidence includes Mr Eyre\u2019s unequivocal statement that \"[t]he intention and understanding of all concerned was that at all times that I would retain full beneficial ownership and control over the company\".232 Especially, as Sri Lankan law does not require a written document to create a trust over shares,233 the witness testimony of Mr Eyre is sufficient to prove that Mr Eyre's intention was to create a trust and that Mr Fernando held the Montrose Share on trust for Mr Eyre - unless the Tribunal finds Mr Eyre's testimony not credible. Further, while it is true that Article 86(1) of the Sri Lanka Companies Act provides that the person who is registered as the legal owner of shares in the share registry is treated as the holder of those shares under the Companies Act, it does not disallow off-register beneficial ownership.234\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 42; Exhibits C-85 and C-58.\n\nFirst Eyre Statement, para 18.\n\nRejoinder, para 248.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 138.\n\n212.\n\nSecondly, as for Montrose Singapore, Sri Lanka \"grossly overstates\" the situation in alleging that Mr Eyre's beneficial interest is incompatible with Sri Lankan law, in particular that Mr Eyre's failure to record his beneficial interest in the Montrose Singapore 2014 accounts disproves the transfer of his beneficial interest in the Montrose Share.235 Particularly given that Montrose Singapore is an exempt non-public company under the Singapore Companies Act, any violation of the SFRS was \"utterly trivial in character\".236 Insofar as Sri Lanka relies on the expert evidence of Ms Chen to demonstrate a breach of the SFRS, her cross-examination - in which, among other things, she had to admit that Montrose Singapore is an exempt private company not required to file audited financial statements containing beneficial interests - discredited her testimony.237 In any event, argue the Claimants, Mr Eyre explained that his failure to disclose and record his beneficial interest in the Montrose Share in Montrose Singapore's accounts was innocent - in the press of his other business, he was unaware of the Singaporean legal requirement and assumed he owned the Montrose Share; in response to a question in cross-examination whether he \"[gave] any thought at all as to whether [he] wanted, needed or intended to keep a beneficial interest in the shares independently of [his] 99 per cent shareholding in Montrose Sri Lanka\", Mr Eyre answered \"No, absolutely not\".238\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 45.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 45.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 46; Tr Day Two 265:11-17.\n\nTr Day One 206:11-24.\n\n213.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that the Montrose arrangements were inconsistent with Sri Lankan law and that inconsistency with host State law has preclusive effect with regard to jurisdiction or admissibility, the Claimants argue that this would not exclude the Tribunal\u2019s competence over all aspects of the claims. This is because, under international law, Mr Eyre still has indirect legal title to the Montrose Share as the 99% shareholder of Montrose Singapore and Montrose has a separate direct claim in respect of the Montrose Land.239\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 119; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 49.\n\n**D. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection F : The Alleged Investment Was Not Made in Accordance with Law and Good Faith, and So is Not a Protected Investment Under the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nIn this Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection, the Respondent directly alleges that, if the Claimants did have a beneficial interest in the Montrose Share *via* trust, that beneficial interest is void under section 4 of the Sri Lankan Trust Ordinance as unlawful, being \"of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law\".240 The relevant law is section 58(3)(A) of the Sri Lankan Finance Act, which imposes a 100% sales tax on a sale of a Sri Lankan company where - as with Montrose - more than 25% of the shares are foreign owned. As any trust in Montrose is void, it is ineffective to create a beneficial interest and incapable of constituting an investment under the BIT.\n\nSri Lankan Trust Ordinance, section 4(1)(b) (RL-42).\n\n215.\n\nIn opposition to the Claimants\u2019 position that this illegality argument goes to admissibility or the merits rather than jurisdiction, the Respondent emphasises that even Professor Douglas supports this argument in the article on which the Claimants rely. According to Sri Lanka, Professor Douglas acknowledges that if a foreign national acquires title that is ineffective under the host State\u2019s law, then there is no investment as a jurisdictional matter.241 This is the situation here under section 4 of the Sri Lankan Trusts Ordinance.\n\nZ Douglas QC, *The Plea of Illegality in Investment Treaty Arbitration* (2014), 29 ICSID Review \u2013 FILJ, page 178 (CL-216).\n\n216.\n\nGiven this situation, with the illegality rendering any trust void, the Respondent describes as \"sterile\" the Parties\u2019 debate as to whether it is implicit in the BIT that investments made contrary to host state law or good faith are not protected.242 However, the Respondent\u2019s position - that such a requirement is implicit in the BIT, without express language of illegality - is supported by *Phoenix v Czech Republic*.243 The Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Bear Creek v Peru* for the contrary position, says Sri Lanka, is misplaced because the tribunal in that case: (a) acknowledged that every case depends on the specific treaty at issue; and, (b) in the case before it, it would not be right to imply a requirement of compliance with host state law and good faith in circumstances where Peru had the option under the relevant treaty to require that an investment be legally constituted to attract protection, but chose not to exercise the option.244\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 70.\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009 (\"***Phoenix Action***\") (RL-146).\n\n*Bear Creek Mining*, paras 319-320.\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimants take umbrage with Sri Lanka\u2019s position that Mr Eyre\u2019s beneficial interest in the Montrose Share breached Sri Lankan law or was otherwise in bad faith. However, even if this Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection were accepted, the Claimants deny that jurisdiction would be ousted, because Mr Eyre still has indirect ownership of the Montrose Share through Montrose Singapore. The alleged illegality, say the Claimants, is a question for admissibility or the merits.245\n\nRejoinder, paras 317 and 335.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants identify their primary position to be that \"a violation of Sri Lankan law cannot strip the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the beneficial interest - unless that interest is determined void as a matter of Sri Lankan law\".246 This is because the BIT has no express legality clause, and so the issue of whether a claimant procured an investment for a purpose in violation of host State laws can only affect a claimant\u2019s case on the merits and not jurisdiction.247 The Claimants rely on *Bear Creek Mining v Peru, Stati v Kazakhstan,* and *Liman v Kazakhstan,* while emphasising that Sri Lanka has proved unable to point to a single case in which a tribunal held that investor illegality was a jurisdictional issue where the BIT lacked an express legality clause.248 Insofar as the Respondent relies on *Phoenix Action v Czech Republic,* the Claimants emphasise that the tribunal there considered the need for compliance with host State law and good faith to be two additional *Salini* factors under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and the case has not been followed in that respect.249\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 50.\n\nRejoinder, paras 316-329; Tr Day Three 567:1-568:8.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 50; *Bear Creek Mining*, paras 319-320 (CL-176); *Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group SA & Terra Raf Trans Trading Ltd v Republic of Kazakhstan*, SCC Case No V (116/2010), Award, 9 December 2013, para 812 (CL-213); *Liman Caspian Oil BV & NCL Dutch Investment BV v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Award, 22 June 2010, para 187 (CL-200).\n\nRejoinder, para 321; *Phoenix Action*, para 114.\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants cite to a commentary by Professor Douglas that the relevant jurisdictional question is whether the alleged illegality is violative of international public policy rather than only of host State law:\n\n*If the investment is procured for a purpose that is illicit under the law of the host State but not under international public policy then this would provide a defence to the merits of the claims.*250\n\nThe Claimants assert that the most serious allegation levied against them by Sri Lanka is violation of only host State law, namely tax evasion under the Sri Lanka Finance Act -and \"[a]t no point is the allegation made that tax evasion is violative of international public policy\".251\n\nZ Douglas QC, *The Plea of Illegality in Investment Treaty Arbitration* (2014), 29 ICSID Review \u2013 FILJ, pages 155, 184 (CL-216)\n\nRejoinder, para 319.\n\n220.\n\nIn any event, argue the Claimants, Mr Eyre's beneficial interest in the Montrose Share was not contrary to the Sri Lankan Finance Act.252 This is because the Finance Act addresses the transfer of *property* rather than a beneficial interest. Section 58(3A) of the Finance Act provides:\n\n*Where there is a transfer of ownership of any **property** within Sri Lanka to a company there shall be charged from the transferee of such property, a tax of such amount as is equivalent to the value of that property, if more than twenty five per centum of the issued shares in such company are owned by persons who are not citizens of Sri Lanka.*253\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 129-144; Rejoinder, paras 330-334.\n\nRL-3 (emphasis added).\n\n221.\n\nSection 66 of the Finance Act provides that the term \"property\" in this context refers only to land.254\n\nRL-5.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimants juxtapose this plain wording of Section 58(3A) of the Finance Act against Sri Lanka's reliance on principles of statutory construction used by the courts to avoid interpreting statutes in ways that \"would enable persons to undermine [the law's integrity] by using the scheme of the Act in unintended ways\".255 Despite this reliance, Sri Lanka failed to identify any cases in which the Sri Lankan courts did in fact use these principles in interpreting and applying Section 58(3A). Most important, the Sri Lankan authorities have taken no enforcement action against the Claimants, or even sought to contact them, about this alleged violation of the Finance Act.\n\nTr Day Two 390:3-18.\n\n223.\n\nFinally, the Claimants oppose Sri Lanka's argument that BIT jurisdiction should be denied because of Mr Eyre's failure to record his beneficial interest on the Montrose Singapore accounts in alleged violation of Singapore law. No tribunal, say the Claimants, has denied jurisdiction on grounds of violation of a municipal law other than the host State law, which is why most legality clauses specifically require compliance only with host State law.\n\n**E. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection G : Mr Eyre Does Not Have a Claimas Indirect Legal Title Holder to the Montrose Land**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(**1**) **The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAs one of their points supporting the limited scope of the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(a) of the BIT, the Respondent contends that by mentioning \"interests in the property of such companies\" in Article 1(a)(ii) without a mention of \"interests in shares\", the BIT excludes indirect shareholdings from coverage.256 To repeat, Article 1(a)(ii) reads: \"Shares, stock and debentures of companies or *interests in the property* of such companies\" (emphasis added). In Sri Lanka's words:\n\n*any alleged \"interests\" in shares are not covered by the reference to \"shares\" because otherwise the language in the second part of the sub-clause of Article 1(a)(ii) would have been used in the context of \"shares\". A clear distinction is drawn between owning the shares of the company, and having an interest in the property of the company. What is more and in any event, an indirect shareholder does not have any form of legal or equitable interest in the shares, though it may have a level of control, something entirely distinct from having an interest.*257\n\nRejoinder para 23, citing Reply, para 39.\n\nReply, para 39.\n\n225.\n\nIn this connection, the Respondent opposes the Claimants' related jurisdictional claim that, based on the \"every kind of asset\" definition in Article 1(a) of the BIT, the \"economic reality\" of the situation must allow Mr Eyre to bring a claim as the indirect title holder to the Montrose Land, without regard to the separate corporate personality of Montrose as direct title holder.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent contends that *Pezold v Zimbabwe,* on which the Claimants rely for this position, was decided incorrectly and, in any event, the tribunal in *Pezold v Zimbabwe* did not have the benefit of the more helpful line of authority in *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka v Hellenic Republic*.258 As set out in *Po\u0161tov\u00e1,* with reference \"to extensive well-established authority\", the default position in international law is that a company is legally distinct from its shareholders (or others claiming to have an interest), the company alone has rights over its own assets, which it alone is capable of protecting, and others have no standing to pursue claims over those assets.259 Absent clear wording, which is lacking here, Mr Eyre lacks standing to pursue a claim to the Montrose Land because he has no legal right to the Montrose Land, as an asset of Montrose.\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold & Others v Republic of Zimbabwe*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/15, Award, 28 July 2015 (\"***Pezold***\") (CL-170).\n\n*Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank*, paras 230-246.\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimants reject Sri Lanka's interpretive argument based on the absence of the phrase \"interests in shares\" from Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT, charging that the argument \"conflates the asset that forms the subject matter of the investment *(i.e.,* \"shares\") with the method of holding it *(i.e.,* directly or indirectly)\".260 As addressed in connection with Sri Lanka's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection based on indirect investment, the Claimants insist that Article 1(a)(ii) is merely illustrative of investments and so the absence of the phrase \"interests in shares\" does not support Sri Lanka's limited interpretation of Article 1(a)(ii).\n\nRejoinder, para 24.\n\n228.\n\nHowever, even if the Tribunal were to accept Sri Lanka's interpretation, there is no impact on jurisdiction. According to the Claimants:\n\n*even if Sri Lanka is correct, and the supposed distinction between \"interests in the property of such companies\" and \"shares\" means that indirect shareholdings are not protected by Article 1(a) (which is denied), then this is tantamount to an acknowledgement that Article 1(a) gives an indirect investor the right to claim with respect to the property of a company. A fortiori, Mr Eyre still holds an investment: the Montrose Land, held indirectly through Montrose Singapore and Montrose Sri Lanka.*261\n\nRejoinder, para 32.\n\n229.\n\nThis is consistent, say the Claimants, with the line of authority in *Pezold v Zimbabwe,* where the tribunal upheld the claimants' position that \"where a company is controlled, legally or factually, by a certain shareholder or group of shareholders, the latter may be entitled to a direct claim in respect of the assets of the former\", and dismissed Zimbabwe's objection that the claimants lacked standing to bring claims related to the protected investments.262\n\n*Pezold*, paras 317-327.\n\n230.\n\nBased on the *Pezold v Zimbabwe* reasoning, the Claimants describe as incorrect Sri Lanka's argument that Mr Eyre lacks standing to bring a claim based on his indirect legal\n\ntitle to the Montrose Land. The Tribunal, say the Claimants, does have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over this claim.\n\n**F. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection H : The Claimants\u2019 Reflective Loss Claim Is Not Permitted Under the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(**1**) **The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n---------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nSri Lanka relies on Article 5 of the BIT for its final Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection, which goes to Mr Eyre's reflective loss claim based on the loss in value of the Montrose Share as a result of the alleged expropriation of the Montrose Share. Article 5 provides (emphasis added):\n\n*(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated, or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation... in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the needs of that Party and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.... The national or company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation to prompt determination of the amount of compensation either by law or by agreement between the parties and to prompt review....*\n\n*(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) are applied **to the extent necessary** to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of the investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.*\n\n232.\n\nSri Lanka argues that Article 5(2) of the BIT limits a shareholder's right to make a claim for expropriation of the relevant company's assets only where \"necessary\". Looking to the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"to the extent necessary\", a shareholder may make a claim for expropriation of a company's assets only in the *Barcelona Traction* type case where the company itself is incapable of acting and, in all other situations, may claim only for direct or indirect expropriation of the actual shares themselves under Article 5(1) of the BIT. Here, says Sri Lanka, Montrose as a company is fully capable of making a claim for expropriation of the Montrose Land in Sri Lanka - and, indeed, has done so in Sri Lanka, and has been paid compensation.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 reliance on *RosInvest v Russia* for the contrary position is misplaced, because the relevant treaty article in that case did not contain the limitation of necessity. The Claimants\u2019 reliance on *AAPL v Sri Lanka* is also misplaced, because the relevant point was not taken in that case.\n\n***(2) The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n---------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants give short shrift to Sri Lanka\u2019s reflective loss argument. They first state that \"[n]aturally, a claim can only be brought under [Article 5(1)] in respect of shares if those shares are expropriated - whether directly or indirectly\", but that does not prevent a shareholder like Mr Eyre from pursuing another cause of action under the BIT, for example for unfair and inequitable treatment, for losses caused by state action.263\n\nRejoinder, para 145.\n\n235.\n\nWith regard to Article 5(2) of the BIT, the Claimants reiterate their responses to Sri Lanka\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection against indirect shareholder claims. They again rely on *RosInvest v Russia* and *AAPL v Sri Lanka* in support of Mr Eyre\u2019s reflective loss claim for the reduction in value of the Montrose Share as a result of the Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the Montrose Land without full compensation. According to the Claimants, the tribunal in *RosInvest v Russia* found that the sole purpose of Article 5(2) is to clarify the right of an indirect shareholder to make an indirect claim in relation to its shares when company assets are expropriated, which was also decided in *AAPL v Sri Lanka*.264\n\nRejoinder, paras 146-147.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal commences its analysis of the Parties\u2019 positions by setting out the basic jurisdictional principles applicable in the instant case. The Tribunal will then address the central disputed issues of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae.*\n\n**A. Jurisdictional Principles**\n--------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe governing principles of jurisdiction are found in the ICSID Convention and the UK-Sri Lanka BIT.\n\n238.\n\nThe relevant jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention are contained in Article 25, which reads in pertinent part (emphasis added):\n\n*(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw the consent unilaterally.*\n\n*(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:*\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State Party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered...*\n\n*(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and **any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party** to the dispute on that date and which, **because of foreign control, the parties agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State** for the purposes of this Convention.*\n\n239.\n\nAs reflected in Article 25, three well-known conditions must be met for ICSID to have jurisdiction:\n\na. a condition *ratione personae:* the dispute must oppose a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State;\n\nb. a condition *ratione materiae:* the dispute must be a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment; and\n\nc. a condition *ratione voluntatis:* the Contracting State and the investor must consent in writing that the relevant dispute be settled through ICSID arbitration.\n\n240.\n\nA fourth condition *ratione temporis* must be added, namely that the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the time of the relevant dispute.\n\n241.\n\nThe jurisdictional requirements of the UK-Sri Lanka BIT are contained in Article 8, which reads in pertinent part:\n\n*(1) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to [ICSID] for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the [ICSID Convention] any legal disputes arising between the Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former.*\n\n*(2) A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which before such dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated for such purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n242.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT provides the definition of the terms \"investment\", \"nationals\" and \"companies\", as relevant here (emphasis added):\n\n*(a) \"investment\" means every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:*\n\n*(i) moveable and immovable property and other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges;*\n\n*(ii) **shares**, stock and debentures of companies or **interests in the property** of such companies;*\n\n*(iii) claims to money or to performance under contract having a financial value;*\n\n*(c) \"nationals\" means:*\n\n*(i) In respect of the United Kingdom: physical persons deriving their status as United Kingdom nationals from the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any territory for the international relations of which the Government of the United Kingdom is responsible;*\n\n*(d) \"Companies\" means:*\n\n*(i) In respect of the United Kingdom: corporations, firms or associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom or in any territory to which this Agreement is extended in accordance with the provisions of Article 11;...*\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent has raised no objections concerning the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* or *ratione temporis* based on consent or time limitations. For good order, the Tribunal confirms that it has jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* and *ratione temporis.*\n\n244.\n\nAs to jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* the relevant dates are not disputed. First, the ICSID Convention entered into force in respect of the United Kingdom on 18 January 1967 and in respect of Sri Lanka on 11 November 1967. Therefore, as of 11 November 1967, the Convention was in effect between Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom within the meaning of Article 25(1). Second, the UK-Sri Lanka BIT entered into force on 18 December 1980. Accordingly, both the ICSID Convention and the BIT were in force when the instant dispute arose, according to the Claimants, on 10 July 2013.265\n\nMemorial, para 82.\n\n245.\n\nAs to jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis,* the necessary consent of the Respondent to ICSID arbitration is found in Article 8(1) of the UK-Sri Lanka BIT of 18 December 1980, and the consent of the Claimants has been given in their Request for Arbitration dated 7 July 2016.\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s numerous Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections concern the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae.*\n\n247.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent has sometimes blurred the different concepts of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae,* particularly in the evolving organisation of its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections, which has made it necessary for the Tribunal to distinguish what is relevant to each. To give one example among many, the Respondent presented Objection 2 in its Reply in the following manner:\n\n*The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae over: (1) Montrose Sri Lanka, because it does not constitute a company of the United Kingdom; and (2) Mr Eyre, because he is not the owner of the shares of Montrose Sri Lanka.*266\n\nReply, Heading C.\n\n248.\n\nIt can readily be seen that the first sentence indeed relates to jurisdiction *ratione personae,* but the second does not, as it relates instead to jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\n\n249.\n\nIn light of the Parties\u2019 blurring of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and *ratione personae* issues, as well as the challenges posed by the evolving facts presented by the Claimants and the evolving categorisation of the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections presented by the Respondent, the Tribunal has found it necessary to analyse those Objections in a structure that does not strictly follow the Parties\u2019 positions.\n\n250.\n\nAs a further preliminary point, the Tribunal confirms that the Claimants carry the burden of proof on their affirmative jurisdictional case. Where the burden shifts to the Respondent in connection with a particular Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection, the Tribunal will so indicate.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants Montrose and Mr Eyre contend that each is a qualifying United Kingdom national under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n252.\n\nThe case of Mr Eyre is straightforward. It is undisputed that Mr Eyre is a UK national, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* as to him under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(c) of the BIT.\n\n253.\n\nThe case of Montrose, as a Sri Lankan company, is more complicated. The Respondent challenges jurisdiction over Montrose in its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection D (corresponding to Objection 2 in the Respondent\u2019s Reply).\n\n254.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* as to Montrose as well as Mr Eyre, for the reasons that follow.\n\n255.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, in its second sentence, provides that ICSID jurisdiction extends - by exception to the general rule that ICSID arbitration is not designed for companies against their own State of incorporation - to \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute... and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\". Although the text is one interrupted sentence, the text also reflects that Article 25(2)(b) separately establishes both a subjective test and an objective test of jurisdiction *ratione personae.*\n\n256.\n\nFirst, the Article 25(2)(b) *subjective test* is raised by the phrase \"the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this subjective test is met here by Article 8(2) of the BIT, as a declaration of the agreement between Sri Lanka and United Kingdom for purposes of the second clause of Article 25(2). To recall, Article 8(2) provides:\n\n*A company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in the territory of one Contracting Party and in which before such dispute arises the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated for such purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n257.\n\nArticle 8(2) expressly makes a connection to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and Montrose is a juridical person incorporated under the law in force in Sri Lanka.\n\n258.\n\nSecondly, the Article 25(2)(b) *objective test* is raised by the phrase \"because of foreign control\". A claimant does not meet this test simply by meeting the subjective test: these two tests are not the same. This is well-reflected in two decisions where issues similar to those in this arbitration were present. In *Vacuum Salt v Ghana,* the tribunal decided (emphasis added):\n\n*the parties' agreement to treat Claimant as a foreign national \"because of foreign control\" does not ipso jure confer jurisdiction.*\n\n*The reference in Article 25(2)(b) to \"foreign control\" necessarily sets an objective Convention limit beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist and parties therefore lack power to invoke same no matter how devoutly they may have desired to do so....*267\n\n*Vacuum Salt*, para 36.\n\n259.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Autopista v Venezuela* decided: \"locally incorporated companies may agree to ICSID arbitration subject to two requirements: [t]he parties have agreed to treat the said company as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention; and [t]he said company is subject to foreign control\".268\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001, para 104 (RL-8).\n\n260.\n\nAccordingly, the next question for the Tribunal is whether the necessary objective foreign control of Montrose exists. According to Article 8(2) of the BIT, the relevant national company - here, Montrose - may be deemed foreign if \"the majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\" - here, Mr Eyre as a United Kingdom national. The issue here is whether Mr Eyre must *directly* exercise \"foreign control\" of the sole Montrose Share, i.e. by owning the share directly himself, or whether indirect control will suffice, i.e. the share being held by Montrose Singapore over which he has ultimate control.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s basic position, as detailed in Section VII.B above, is that Mr Eyre's indirect ownership of Montrose deprives Montrose of deemed United Kingdom nationality for purposes of the BIT. This position rests on Sri Lanka\u2019s interpretation of Articles 1(a) and 8.2 of the BIT. Given that: (a) Article 1(a) includes in the definition of \"investment\" \"[s]hares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property of such companies\"; (b) \"companies\" is defined in Article 1(d)(ii) as the relevant locally incorporated company; and (c) Article 1(a)(ii) does not expressly include an interest in *shares* as \"an interest *in the property* of such companies\", the protected \"shares\" may only be shares of Montrose as a Sri Lankan company. As only Montrose Singapore directly owns the Montrose Share, Article 1(a) necessarily excludes Mr Eyre\u2019s indirect holding in Montrose because this shareholding through Montrose Singapore reflects only his *interest in* the Montrose Share and not *ownership* of the Montrose Share itself. Further, given that Article 8(2) of the BIT requires that the majority of the shares of the relevant locally incorporated company be *\"owned* by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\", Mr Eyre cannot *own* the sole Montrose Share for purposes of Article 8(2) without having *direct legal title* to the sole Montrose Share, which he does not have.\n\n262.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 response, in brief, is that Mr Eyre has *\"direct beneficial title* to the sole share in Montrose, which is a Sri Lankan-domiciled company\", and holds *indirect legal title* to the sole Montrose Share through his (Mr Eyre\u2019s) 99% stake in Montrose Singapore, which owns Montrose.269 This is sufficient, argue the Claimants, to allow Mr Eyre to exercise the foreign control of Montrose necessary to establish jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the ICSID Convention and Article 8(2) of the BIT.\n\nMemorial, paras 99-101 (emphasis in original).\n\n263.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal does not accept Sri Lanka\u2019s interpretation of Article 1(a) of the BIT together with Article 8(2).\n\n264.\n\nAs for the definition of investment in Article 1(a), there are many tribunal decisions recognising indirect shareholder claims where the relevant treaty, like the UK-Sri Lanka BIT, defines investment broadly as \"every kind of asset\".\n\n265.\n\nTurning to Article 8(2), which the Tribunal confirms is a declaration of consent for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and hence most relevant to the instant issue, there is no indication in the text of Article 8(2) of the BIT that the majority of shares in the relevant host State company cannot be owned *indirectly* by a national of the other Contracting State. The purpose of Article 8(2) is to allow a locally incorporated company, which is often required for local investment, to bring a claim in its own right for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, without regard to the rights of direct or indirect shareholders in that company.\n\n266.\n\nTo recognize indirect *foreign control* of such a locally incorporated company, through indirect as well as direct share ownership, is in line with both ICSID jurisprudence and commercial reality. In modern international economic relations, chains of closely-held companies are frequently used, without preventing the majority shareholder at the top of a chain from asserting control of or making claims on behalf of a foreign company lower in the chain. To quote Professor Schreuer:\n\n*Whereas the first part of Art. 25(2)(b) merely refers to an investor's nationality, the second part specifically refers to control. This would indicate an approach that is governed less by formal aspects of corporate nationality than by economic realities. Therefore, on balance, the better approach would appear to be a realistic look at the true controllers thereby blocking access to the Centre for juridical persons that are controlled directly or indirectly by nationals of non-Contracting States or nationals of host states.*270\n\n*Schreue* r, page 323.\n\n267.\n\nTurning to the instant case, the Tribunal accepts that the Claimants have met the indirect foreign control test. Mr Eyre, a United Kingdom national, owns 99% of the shares of Montrose Singapore, which in turn is the legal owner of the sole Montrose Share, and hence Mr Eyre indirectly exercises control over the Sri Lankan national company Montrose. This nearly 100% foreign ownership meets the level that the *Vacuum Salt* tribunal found, in the context of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, \"almost certainly would result in foreign control, by whatever standard\".271\n\n*Vacuum Salt*, para 43.\n\n268.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has decided, based on Mr Eyre's indirect ownership of the Montrose Share, that Montrose can \"be treated as a national of another Contracting State\" for purposes of the objective foreign control test in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n269.\n\nIn light of this holding, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address Sri Lanka's arguments based on the United Kingdom FCO Memorandum, especially as there is no indication that it was part of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BIT. Similarly, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to address the Parties' lengthy exchanges on the possible import of *Barcelona Traction,* customary international law and Article 5(2) of the BIT on the interpretation of the definition of investment in Article 1(a) of the BIT.\n\n270.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* as to both Claimants: as to Mr Eyre, under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(c) of the BIT; and as to Montrose, under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal rejects the Respondent's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection *ratione personae* D (corresponding to Objection 2 in the Respondent's Reply).\n\n**C. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nAgain, as there are two Claimants - Montrose and Mr Eyre - the Tribunal must ascertain its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* for each of them, by determining whether each has a protected investment for purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(a) of the BIT.\n\n272.\n\nThe first step is to identify the investment at issue. The Claimants together seek compensation of some US$ 20 million for the loss of their investment in the planned Hotel Project on the Montrose Land. Sri Lanka has, more or less clearly, divided its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections between the Claimants' alleged investment in the Montrose Land itself and Mr Eyre's alleged investment in the Montrose Share.\n\n273.\n\nIn this regard, it bears restating that Montrose has legal title to and owns the Montrose Land, and Montrose Singapore has equity title to and owns the Montrose Share, and hence directly owns Montrose. Although Mr Eyre originally based a claim on alleged beneficial ownership of the Montrose Land itself, he has limited his claim to a beneficial ownership interest only in the Montrose Share through his 99% ownership of Montrose Singapore. Accordingly, only Montrose has a claim based on investment directly in the Montrose Land.\n\n***(1) The Alleged Investment in the Montrose Land***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Investment in the Montrose Land by Montrose versus Electro Resorts \u2014 Import of the MOU***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe question whether Montrose itself has a protected investment under the UK-Sri Lanka BIT is the focus of Sri Lanka's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection A (corresponding to Objection 6 in the Respondent's Reply). Sri Lanka contends that the Claimants cannot claim in respect of Electro Resorts' beneficial interest in the Montrose Land and/or the Montrose Land does not constitute an investment under Articles 1(a)(ii) and 8(1) of the BIT. This Objection turns on the impact of the undated (apparently July 2010) Memorandum of Understanding between Montrose Global and Electro Resorts (again, the \"**MOU**\"), which assumed such prominence in the Respondent's case.\n\n275.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that Sri Lanka carries the burden to prove that Electro Resorts has a beneficial interest in the Montrose Land by operation of the MOU and a constructive trust under Sri Lankan law, rather than requiring the Claimants to prove a negative. The Tribunal finds that Sri Lanka has failed to prove, on a balance of the probabilities, that the operative instrument for transfer of the Montrose Land was the MOU and not the 4 August 2010 Deed of Transfer.\n\n276.\n\nFollowing careful examination of the Parties' submissions and the relevant evidence, the Tribunal finds the MOU to be a non-binding agreement both on the facts and under the applicable English governing law. There are several reasons for this conclusion.\n\n277.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal cannot accept that reasonable businesspersons would agree, on a binding basis, to regulate a multi-million-dollar real estate development project with an undated document, from which other agreements would potentially follow. It is simply not a credible situation, especially given that, in comparison, the MOU contained a specific date for the completion of other Development Project documentation and all of the other prospective agreements referred to in the MOU are identified with their respective future dates.\n\n278.\n\nSecondly, on the facts in the record, Sri Lanka has failed to show whether, how and when the parties to the MOU acted upon the terms therein for the purported sale of the Montrose Land. Sri Lanka has also failed to show how an understanding between two parties -Montrose Global and Electro Resorts - could bind Montrose as a non-party to that understanding, particularly when Montrose subsequently concluded a Deed of Transfer with Electro Resorts to purchase the same Montrose Land.\n\n279.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, the Tribunal considers that the MOU was superseded by the Deed of Transfer signed on 4 August 2010. The Deed of Transfer is a dated and notarised document. The date and content of the Deed of Transfer is patently inconsistent with the MOU-related email exchanged between Ravi Wethasinghe and Mr Eyre less than two weeks earlier on 23 July 2010, which envisioned transfer of the Montrose Land, a meeting with a notary, and the signing of the MOU on the following Monday, 26 July 2010.\n\n280.\n\nThe transfer language of the Deed of Transfer is unequivocal. It recites that Electro Resorts, as the Vendor, has agreed with Montrose, as the Purchaser:\n\n*for the absolute sale and conveyance... all that allotment of land depicted in Plan No.1700 dated 14th February, 1978... together with the buildings, trees, plantations and everything else standing thereon... free of all encumbrances and charges whatsoever at or for the price or sum of RUPEES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONLY (Rs.100,000,000-) of lawful money of the said Republic of Sri Lanka\".*\n\n*In the presence of the said agreement and in consideration of the said sum of [Rs 100 million] of lawful money of the said Republic of Sri Lanka well and truly paid to the VENDOR by the PURCHASER (the receipt whereof the VENDOR doth hereby expressly admit and acknowledge) the VENDOR both hereby sell grant convey transfer assign set over and assure to the PURCHASER all that allotment of land depicted in Plan No.1700 dated 14th February, 1978....*\n\n281.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Deed of Transfer could serve as a valid and binding transfer of the Montrose Land from Electro Resorts to Montrose. However, its validity was not challenged, and could have been challenged only for a good legal reason, for example, for fraud, failure of consideration, or non-existence of the land, and this is not Sri Lanka's case.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the Respondent's point that the notary, Ms Mudalige, added at the end of the Deed of Transfer the certification that \"the within mentioned consideration was not passed in my presence\".272 This does not prove, however, that Montrose did not pay the consideration, but only that it was not paid in the notary's presence. There is contrary evidence that the consideration was paid, including: (a) the 27 July 2010 Electro Resorts Board resolution recording the sale and transfer of the Montrose Land for Rs 100 million (with no mention of the MOU); and (b) the entry in the Montrose audited company accounts of Mr Eyre's having paid Rs 100 million for the Montrose Land, which Mr Eyre admitted he did not remember.\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\n283.\n\nAlthough this evidence does leave the record uncertain as to whether and when Montrose paid the 100 million rupees, the Tribunal cannot agree that this invalidates the effect of the Deed of Transfer. If in fact the payment was not made, Electro Resorts may have had a claim for non-payment against Montrose or some other remedy for breach of contract, but this matter is not before this Tribunal, and no suggestion to that effect has been made.\n\n284.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal considers that its findings on the effect of the MOU are determinative, it will nonetheless address the Respondent's assertion of a constructive trust in favour of Electro Resorts. To remind, the Respondent describes the present dispute as \"a classic case of Electro retaining the beneficial interest in the Land, by reason of a constructive trust being automatically imposed pursuant to section 83 of the Trust Ordinance\".273 To this end, Sri Lanka contends that, because the constructive trust arose automatically under Sri Lankan law: (a) it is entitled to take the same points as, and be in no less a position than, Electro Resorts in these proceedings; and (b) that equity would disregard the separate corporate personality of Montrose Global and Montrose, because Mr Eyre controls both.274\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 22.\n\nRespondent's Closing Submissions, para 22.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal finds both of these contentions unpersuasive and insufficiently supported by either facts or law. Sri Lanka has not shown why it is entitled to be in the same position as Electro Resorts, which is a private entity owned and controlled by Ravi Wethasinghe, or provided any legal basis for such assertion. Nor has Sri Lanka proven on what grounds the Tribunal should disregard the corporate personality of both Montrose Global and Montrose, other than noting that Mr Eyre owns both companies.\n\n286.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the MOU was superseded by the Deed of Transfer, there is no need for a ruling on the Respondent\u2019s request that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the Claimants\u2019 failure to produce MOU-related documents post-dating the MOU itself.\n\n287.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls Sri Lanka\u2019s allegations that the Claimants were \"deliberately economical with the true facts\",275 and the objection of the Claimants\u2019 counsel to what they saw as an \"attempt to undermine or attack Mr Eyre\u2019s credibility at every stage\".276 As the Tribunal President stated in the hearing: \"that is not how the Tribunal heard that evidence yesterday. Sloppy perhaps, too busy, perhaps, but... we did not hear that as being a charge of lying or an attack on Mr Eyre\u2019s overall business reputation\".277 The Tribunal reiterates that Mr Eyre appeared to be a witness of integrity, who clearly explained what he did remember and frankly admitted what he could not remember about transactions that he described as personal matters to which he acknowledged he did not bring his full professional attention and skills.\n\nReply, para 3.\n\nTr Day Two 432:22-433:24.\n\nTr Day Two 433:25-434:10.\n\n288.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection A (corresponding to Objection 6 in the Respondent\u2019s Reply).\n\n***b. Proof of Investment in the Montrose Land by Montrose and/or Mr Eyre***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nIn its Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B (corresponding most closely to Objections 7 and 8 in the Respondent\u2019s Reply), Sri Lanka contends that the Claimants have no investment in the Montrose Land under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1 of the BIT because neither made a contribution to acquire the Montrose Land for the Hotel Project nor took any related investment risk.\n\n290.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, it is undisputed that Montrose holds legal title to the Montrose Land, which could be an investment if the Montrose Land qualifies as a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n291.\n\nAs the Tribunal has determined that the Deed of Transfer and not the MOU was the operative instrument for transfer of the Montrose Land, Electro Resorts does not have a competing beneficial interest in the Montrose Land. Nor is Mr Eyre asserting an investment claim based on beneficial ownership of the Montrose Land.\n\n292.\n\nTherefore, although technically Sri Lanka\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B should concern only Montrose\u2019s claim for investment in the Montrose Land, the record reflects that any investment came through Mr Eyre and so the Tribunal must also examine his role. This examination necessarily overlaps with other Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections made by Sri Lanka based on Mr Eyre\u2019s claims for loss of his alleged investment in the Montrose Share. Indeed, the Tribunal decides that the Montrose Share can qualify as a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT only if Montrose itself has a protected investment in the planned Hotel Project on the Montrose Land, which is addressed below.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find it necessary to resolve the dispute between the Parties as to whether the *Salini* criteria do or do not apply *per se* in evaluating whether an investor has made a protected investment. There are now many decisions that have considered that \"investment\" has an inherent meaning and implies at least a contribution by the investor, a certain duration, and economic risk. This risk may be anticipated or unanticipated changes to market conditions, economic factors and/or political influences affecting the commercial transaction in the area of the investment. This was pertinently stated by the tribunal in *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka v Hellenic Republic:*\n\n*361. If an \"objective\" test is applied, in the absence of a contribution to an economic venture, there could be no investment. An investment, in the economic sense, is linked with a process of creation of value, which distinguishes it clearly from a sale, which is a process of exchange of values...*\n\n*367. Under an \"objective\" test, the element of risk is essential and cannot be analysed in isolation. Indeed any economic transaction - it could even be said any human activity entails some element of risk. Risk is inherent in life and cannot per se qualify what is an investment.*\n\n*368. The investment risk, for purposes of the application of an \"objective\" test, was defined by the Romak tribunal as follows:*\n\n*\"All economic activity entails a certain degree of risk. As such, all contracts - including contracts that do not constitute an investment - carry the risk of non-performance. However, this kind of risk is pure commercial, counterparty risk, or, otherwise stated, the risk of doing business generally. It is therefore not an element that is useful for the purpose of distinguishing between an investment and a commercial transaction.*\n\n*An \u2018investment risk' entails a different kind of alea, a situation in which the investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount he will end up spending, even if all relevant counterparties discharge their contractual obligations. Where there is \u2018risk\u2019 of this sort, the investor simply cannot predict the outcome of the transaction.\"*\n\n*369. In other words, under an \"objective\" approach, an investment risk would be an operational risk and not a commercial risk or a sovereign risk. A commercial risk covers, inter alia, the risk that one of the parties might default on its obligation, which risk exists in any economic relationship. A sovereign risk includes the risk of interference of the Government in a contract or any other relationship, which risk is not specific to public bonds.*\n\n*370. Under the objective approach, commercial and sovereign risks are distinct from operational risk. The distinction here would be between a risk inherent in the investment operation in its surrounding - meaning that the profits are not ascertained but depend on the success or failure of the economic venture concerned - and all the other commercial and sovereign risks.*278\n\n*Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Bank*, paras 361 and 367-370 (footnotes omitted), citing *Romak*, paras 229-230.\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts these criteria for the concept of a protected investment - \"a contribution to an economic venture of a certain duration implying an operational risk\" -and will analyse the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment in the Montrose Land against these criteria.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent bases this Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection on the lack of credible evidence in the record that either Montrose or Mr Eyre paid consideration for the alleged transfer of the Montrose Land from Electro Resorts. Sri Lanka also rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that they do not need to prove payment for the Montrose Land itself, but can rely on proof of Mr Eyre\u2019s contribution to the Hotel Project under principles of unity of investment. Sri Lanka argues that the Claimants cannot rely upon principles of unity of investment to prove that the Hotel Project qualifies as an investment under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, because they never obtained planning permission nor entered into contractual commitments to develop the bare Montrose Land. As the Hotel Project was only aspirational, the Claimants undertook at most pre-investment activity without incurring investment risk.\n\n296.\n\nIn support of their claim that the Montrose Land constitutes an investment, the Claimants argue that Mr Eyre \"owned - both directly and indirectly - Montrose, which served as the investment vehicle for the entire Hotel Project\".279 They rely upon the unity of investment concept in *Inmaris v Ukraine.*280 Mr Eyre claims further that he made substantial contributions to the investment in the Hotel Project, by arranging for feasibility studies and development strategy reports, retaining Woods Bagot to prepare the initial architectural proposal, and approaching hotel management companies and potential sources of development finance in the private and public sectors. Once the Montrose Land was flooded, he made significant efforts to have the damage remedied and to find a solution by liaising with Sri Lankan officials. Mr Eyre also: (a) in 2003, lent approximately US$ 1 million to Ravi Wethasinghe to obtain his initial security interest over the Montrose Land by way of lease; (b) in 2007, contributed US$ 350,000 to the initial development costs of the Montrose Land; (c) in 2010, arranged the incorporation of Montrose and, through Mr Fernando, directed operations of the company; and (d) in 2010, through Montrose Singapore, paid the additional sum of US$ 1 million to Electro Resorts to purchase the Montrose Land. Mr Eyre intended to be involved in the Hotel Project long-term, and certainly took on commercial risk. Finally, through Mr Eyre's efforts, the Hotel Project would have provided substantial work and jobs for the local community, as well as tax revenue to Sri Lanka.\n\nMemorial, para 112.\n\n*Inmaris*, para 92.\n\n297.\n\nFor purposes of determining whether the Montrose Land constitutes a protected investment, the Tribunal considers that in this case and for the reasons explained above, the criteria of contribution and operational risk are sufficient to defeat jurisdiction *ratione materiae.*\n\n298.\n\nAs for Montrose, there is no evidence whatsoever on the record that Montrose itself paid any funds or made any other contribution towards the purchase of the Montrose Land from Electro Resorts or later towards the Hotel Development.\n\n299.\n\nThe situation is more complicated for Mr Eyre. Turning first to the Montrose Land itself, the Claimants admit that there was no written sale contract for the Montrose Land, and rely on the Deed of Transfer.281 The Deed of Transfer recites that Montrose Singapore paid Electro Resorts consideration of Rs 100 million (approximately US$ 887,000) for the Montrose Land, but the notary attested that she did not witness actual payment. The Claimants rely on evidence that payment came on 4 April 2011 from Montrose Singapore, although Montrose Singapore was not incorporated until September 2011, and the receipt from Electro Resorts is for US$ 1 million.282 Mr Eyre attempted to explain the difference with testimony that part of the consideration for the Montrose Land was his forgiveness of his earlier loans of US$ 1 million and US$ 350,000 to Ravi Wethasinghe, but there is no evidence on the record documenting that those loans were in fact made or, more importantly, connecting those loans to the sale and transfer of the Montrose Land.\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\nExhibit C-44.\n\n300.\n\nEven accepting Mr Eyre's explanation that his dealings with the Ravi Wethasinghe and the Montrose Land were personal and hence suffered from a lack of his customary professional attention, the Tribunal cannot ignore the patent lack of credible evidence documenting the sale and transfer terms for the Montrose Land. The Tribunal cannot find, on a balance of the probabilities, that Mr Eyre - through Montrose or Montrose Global or any other Montrose Group entity - contributed funds towards the purchase of the Montrose Land or, in any event, that he (or Montrose Group companies) contributed more than US$ 1 million. Even if he did contribute the US$ 1 million referenced in the Electro Resorts receipt, it can only be seen, for purposes of this Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection, to have been for the bare land and hence contributed without investment risk. The Tribunal notes that Sri Lanka awarded Montrose close to US$ 1 million - approximately US$ 838,947 - for the undeveloped Montrose Land in December 2016.\n\n301.\n\nTurning from the bare Montrose Land to the planned Hotel Project, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that principles of unity of investment283 do not elevate Mr Eyre's payments and efforts in relation to the potential hotel development and to the contribution and operational risk necessary to prove a qualifying investment under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants have not proven, on a balance of the probabilities, that the Hotel Project was anywhere near a certainty before the dredging and compulsory State acquisition of the Montrose Land. The record reflects that Mr Eyre has not obtained formal planning permission and, in fact, there was no evidence that the suspension of the amended preliminary planning clearance application submitted on 12 March 2012 had been raised or of any application for it to be raised or for new permission. Further, Mr Eyre has not, despite obviously substantial efforts, actually executed contractual commitments with architects, hotel management firms or financiers. The Claimants may be right in stating in the Memorial that the Hotel Project was recognised as \"potentially lucrative\",284 but more than potential is necessary. There must have been substantive commitments and arrangements entered into, involving specific commitments and financial costs, all of which would entail both certain risks as well as possible benefits.\n\nFor example, such as those addressed by the tribunal in *Inmaris v Ukraine*.\n\nMemorial, para 212.\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal can find only that the Hotel Project remained at best aspirational at the time of the compulsory State acquisition in 2010.285 Consequently, Mr Eyre's contributions rose only to the pre-investment level and he did not face the operational risk necessary for the Hotel Project to qualify as a protected investment for purposes of Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nThis is similar to the situation in *Romak*, *see* paras 228-231.\n\n303.\n\nTo conclude, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal accepts Sri Lanka's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B (corresponding to Objection 7 in the Respondent's Reply), and finds that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimants' claim based on the Montrose Land - whether bare land or as the base for the planned Hotel Project - which is not a protected investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(2) The Alleged Investment in the Montrose Share***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondent's remaining Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections - Objections C and E through H - go to Mr Eyre's alleged investment in the Montrose Share, which encompasses his alleged investment in the Hotel Project planned for the Montrose Land.\n\n305.\n\nAll of the remaining Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections are variations on the theme that Mr Eyre's shareholder claims are parasitical to claims made by Montrose as the company through which Mr Eyre must claim, whether as indirect shareholder or beneficial owner of the Montrose Share. Preliminary Objection C (corresponding most closely to Objection 8 in the Respondent's Reply) is expressly titled as such: \"Any Alleged Shareholder Claim Is Dependent Upon the Land Constituting an Asset of Montrose, Which It Is Not\". Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection E (corresponding most closely to Objection 1 in the Reply), which focuses on Mr Eyre's alleged beneficial interest in the Montrose Share, echoes the Respondent's arguments relating to indirect ownership of the Montrose Land in Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B, complicated by questions as to whether Mr Fernando and later Montrose Singapore held the Montrose Share on trust for Mr Eyre. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection F (corresponding to Objection 9 in the Reply) adds the allegation that, even if Mr Eyre did have a beneficial interest in the Montrose Share *via* a trust, that beneficial interest is void as unlawful tax evasion under Sri Lankan law. Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection G (corresponding most closely to Objections 4 and 5 in the Reply) essentially repeats the argument made in Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B that the definition of investment in Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT does not expressly include an \"interest in shares\" in the reference to \"[s]hares... and interests in property\". Finally, in Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection H (corresponding to Objection 3 in the Reply), the Respondent rejects any reflective loss claim for Mr Eyre based on any loss in value of the Montrose Share as a result of the alleged expropriation of the Montrose Land.\n\n306.\n\nBased on the history of the Montrose Land transfer and the planned Hotel Project, and as the Tribunal has already observed, the Montrose Share could qualify as a protected investment under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention only if Montrose itself had a protected investment in the Hotel Project on the Montrose Land. The Tribunal has already determined that the Montrose Land, whether alone or with the planned Hotel Project, does not qualify as a protected investment. Consequently, there is no need for the Tribunal to address and decide the remaining Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections. The Respondent's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections C, E, F, G and H (corresponding to Claims 8, 1, 9, 4-5 and 3 in the Respondent's Reply) are dismissed.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. The Claimants\u2019 Cost Submissions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nIn their Statement of Costs, the Claimants seek total legal and expert costs for the jurisdictional phase of \u00a3418,697.78. This breaks down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Component | Amount |\n| Solicitor Fees and Expenses (Bird & Bird LLP) | \u00a3205,297.78 |\n| Counsel Fees | \u00a3136,920.00 |\n| Sri Lankan Counsel Fees and Expenses | \u00a372,540.00 |\n| Factual Witness Expenses | \u00a33,940.00 |\n| **TOTAL** | **\u00a3418,697.78** |\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimants also seek the Tribunal fees and other arbitration costs for the jurisdictional phase, including ICSID fees and venue, transcriber and interpreter fees, to be determined by the Tribunal.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nIn its Schedule of Costs Relating to Jurisdiction, the Respondent seeks total legal and expert costs of \u00a31,014,487.01, plus reimbursement of arbitration costs. The legal fees and expert costs break down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Component | Amount |\n| Solicitor Fees (Clyde & Co LLP) | \u00a3271,065.65 |\n| Solicitor Fees (Allen & Gledhill) | \u00a342,264.85 |\n| Expert Fees (Mazars LLP) | \u00a326,056.62 |\n| Counsel Fees | \u00a3651,226.50 |\n| Disbursements (travel, hotel, bank charges, courier, photocopying, stationary, searches, sundries, USB devices) | \u00a323,873.39 |\n| **TOTAL** | **\u00a31,014,487.01** |\n\nThe Respondent also seeks costs relating to the substantive proceedings incurred before the Tribunal\u2019s bifurcation decision, excluding costs of the jurisdiction application, in the total amount of \u00a3176,847.66. This includes solicitor fees, counsel fees, expert fees of Mr Eric Levy, and other disbursements.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n311.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n312.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses  \nProf. Lucy Reed 122,956.76  \nProf. Brigitte Stern 102,925.14  \nProf. Julian Lew 87,370.19  \nICSID's administrative fees 158,000.00  \nDirect expenses 42,412.92  \n**Total** **513,665.01**\n\n313.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties.286 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration has amounted to US$ 256,832.51.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments advanced to ICSID.\n\n314.\n\nIn exercising its discretion, the Tribunal has considered that, although the Respondent has prevailed in having the arbitration dismissed for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the Claimants did prevail on the Respondent's Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections based on jurisdiction *ratione personae* and on the Objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* based on the MOU. Further, even recognising the necessity for the Respondent to address the Claimants' evolving facts, the Tribunal considers Sri Lanka's legal fees to be excessively high, in part due to the unnecessarily complicated iterations of the Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections.\n\n315.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal has determined that the Claimants and the Respondent should each bear their one-half of the total arbitration costs, and that the Claimants should pay the Respondent one-third of the total amount of its solicitors, counsel and expert fees and disbursements for the jurisdiction phase. The Tribunal denies the Respondent's claim for costs pre-dating the jurisdiction bifurcation decision.\n\n**X. AWARD**\n------------\n\n316.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* as to the claims of both Claimants, and the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection D (corresponding to Objection 2 in the Respondent\u2019s Reply) is dismissed;\n\n(2) The Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection B (corresponding to Objection 7 in the Respondent\u2019s Reply) is granted, and all of the Claimants\u2019 claims are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae;*\n\n(3) The Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections A (corresponding to Objection 6 in the Respondent\u2019s Reply, respectively) is dismissed;\n\n(4) All other Preliminary Jurisdictional Objections and claims are dismissed;\n\n(5) The Claimants are ordered to pay to the Respondent \u00a3338,162.34, which equals one-third of the total amount of its solicitor, counsel and expert fees, and disbursements for the jurisdiction phase; and\n\n(6) The Claimants and the Respondent are each to bear their one-half of the total arbitration costs of US$ 256,832.51."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment (Excerpts)", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2020-12-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment (Excerpts)\n--------------------------------\n\n**INDEX OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Award** | Award dated 5 March 2020, rendered in ICSID Case No. ARB/16/25 |\n| **Applicants** | Mr Raymond Charles Eyre and Montrose Developments (Private) Limited |\n| **Application** | Application for Annulment, dated 1 May 2020 |\n| **Applicants' Alternative Case** | Case submitted by the Applicants in the letter dated 30 June 2020 and the Reply on Annulment requesting the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention on the basis that the Tribunal: (i) failed to apply the principle of unity of investment to the Applicants' investment operation or alternatively did not properly explain its application, (ii) failed to apply the concept of investment risk to the Applicants' investment operation or alternatively did not properly explain its application, and (iii) ignored evidence material to the Applicants case or alternatively failed to explain how it took account of that evidence. |\n| **Applicants' Primary Case** | Case submitted by the Applicants in the Application for Annulment and the Reply on Annulment requesting the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention on the basis that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by deciding in the Award, as a matter of law, that the Montrose Share did not qualify as an investment because the Montrose Land was not an investment itself and therefore Montrose Sri Lanka did not hold a qualifying investment. |\n| **Committee** | *Ad hoc C*ommittee deciding the present annulment composed by Prof. Eduardo Zuleta (President), Dr Nudrat E.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis annulment proceeding relates to the Award dated 5 March 2020, rendered in ICSID Case No. ARB/16/25 between Mr Raymond Charles Eyre and Montrose Developments (Private) Limited, on the one side, and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, on the other side (the **\"Award\").** The Award, rendered by a Tribunal composed of Prof. Lucy Reed (President), Prof. Julian DM Lew QC and Prof. Brigitte Stem (the **\"Tribunal\"),** dismissed jurisdiction for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and ordered the Claimants to pay to the Respondent GBP 338,162.34 for the Respondent\u2019s legal and other costs.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicants are Mr Raymond Charles Eyre **(\"Mr Eyre\")** and Montrose Developments (Private) Limited **(\"Montrose Sri Lanka\")** (the **\"Applicants\").** In this proceeding, the Applicants are represented by:\n\nMr. Raymond Eyre  \n[REDACTED]  \nMr Christopher Harris QC  \nDr Cameron Miles  \n3 Verulam Buildings  \nGray\u2019s Inn  \nLondon WC1R 5NT  \nUnited Kingdom\n\nMs Sophie Eyre  \nMs Rhiannon Price  \nBird & Bud LLP  \n12 New Fetter Lane  \nLondon EC4A 1JP  \nUnited Kingdom\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (the **\"Respondent\"** or **\"Sri Lanka\").

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 1 May 2020, the Applicants presented an Application for Annulment (the \"**Application**\") of the Award. Under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, the Applicants requested that the ICSID Secretary-General provisionally stay the enforcement of the Award until the *ad hoc* Committee rules on such request, and that the stay be maintained until the *ad hoc* Committee renders a decision on the Application.\n\n6.\n\nOn 6 May 2020, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application and notified the Parties that, under ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n7.\n\nOn 2 June 2020, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted under ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53. Its members are Prof. Eduardo Zuleta (President), Dr Nudrat E. Piracha, and Prof. Giorgio Sacerdoti (the \"Committee\"), appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Ms. Martina Polasek, ICSID Deputy Secretary-General, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nOn 5 June 2020, the Committee invited the Applicants to file a submission stating the reasons for the stay of enforcement of the Award by 15 June 2020. In turn, the Committee invited the Respondent to submit its observations on the Applicants' submission by 25 June 2020. The Parties presented their submissions as scheduled. In the Response submitted by the Respondent on 25 June, among other issues, it claimed that Montrose Sri Lanka had no standing to request the stay of enforcement and to appear as an applicant in the annulment proceedings.\n\n9.\n\nOn 25 June 2020, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 June 2020, the Applicants presented their Reply to the Respondent's objection to the stay with two letters, one signed by Mr Raymond C. Eyre and the other by Applicants' counsel, Dr Cameron Miles. The letter signed by Dr Miles included additional grounds and arguments for requesting the annulment of the Award.\n\n11.\n\nOn 1 July 2020, the Secretary of the Committee informed the Parties that given the additional round of pleadings on the request for a stay of enforcement of the Award, the Committee had extended the provisional stay of enforcement until it received both Parties' submissions and reached a decision.\n\n12.\n\nOn 3 July 2020, the Respondent presented its Rejoinder on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 July 2020, the Parties, the Committee, and the ICSID Secretariat held the First Session.\n\n14.\n\nOn 16 July 2020, the Committee issued its Decision on the stay of enforcement of the Award, ordering to maintain the stay of enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the Application. The Committee reasoned as follows:\n\n*78. In view of the Parties' submissions, the Committee considers that three circumstances must be analysed cumulatively in the case at hand: (i) the risk of non-payment of the Award if the Application for Annulment is rejected; (ii) the risk of non-recovery if the stay is lifted and the Award is annulled; and (iii) the balance of hardship between the Parties.*\n\n*79. The Committee considers that it must balance the potential prejudice that each party would suffer if the stay is maintained or terminated and, therefore, will exercise its discretion in view of balancing the interests of the Parties by appreciating the circumstances as specified by them. [\u2026]*\n\n*a. Risk of non-payment*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*86. The Committee notes that the risk of non-payment must be objective and supported with evidence. Considering the allegations and documents presented by the Parties, the Committee concludes that there is not enough evidence to determine that a considerable risk of non-payment exists. [\u2026]*\n\n*b. Risk of non-recoupment*\n\n*87. The Committee notes that the risk of non-recoupment must be objective and supported with evidence. Considering the allegations and documents presented by the Parties, the Committee finds that there is no considerable risk of non-recoupment if the Application is upheld. [\u2026]*\n\n*c. Balance of hardship*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*94. Thus, the Committee concludes that the balance of hardship weighs in favour of the Applicant. If the stay is upheld, it would continue for a short period that would be compensated by the interest accrued. Conversely, \u2013 and given Montrose's non-availability of funds and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Mr Eyre's businesses \u2013, if the stay is lifted, the Applicants would suffer prejudice beyond the inherent or normal effects of an adverse ICSID award subject to /pending annulment proceedings.*\n\n*95. As regards Respondent's request to condition the stay upon posting of security, the Committee observes (i) that Sri Lanka has not demonstrated risk of non-payment by the Applicants; (ii) that the grant of the security would place the Respondent in an advantageous position which will be unjustified given the short timelines of these proceedings, Mr Eyre's undertaking regarding the availability of funds, and the relatively small sum of the cost to be paid by the Applicants and that a larger sum was granted under the LAA Award; and (iii) that the proposed security would cause considerable financial strain on the Applicants (as already set out). Therefore, the Committee considers that no additional security besides Mr Eyre's undertaking is justified. [\u2026]*1\n\nDecision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 16 July 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, 86-87, 94-95.\n\n15.\n\nIn respect of the issue regarding Montrose Sri Lanka's standing to appear as applicant in the present annulment proceedings, the Committee concluded that:\n\n*it is uncontested between the Parties that the Annulment Application and the request for stay were presented by both Mr Eyre and Montrose Sri Lanka. Therefore, for the decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, the Committee will consider as applicants those who applied for annulment. The issues of standing as submitted by Respondent, including the effects of an annulment regarding each of the Applicants, refer to the merits of the annulment itself and therefore is a matter to be decided at a later stage. Therefore, the Committee will decide on the stay of the Award without prejudice to any claims that Respondent may have during the annulment proceedings as to the effects of the Award on each of Mr Eyre and Montrose [Sri Lanka].*2\n\nDecision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 16 July 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 July 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**P.O. No. 1**\"), where it set out the procedural rules that the Parties agreed, and that the Committee determined shall govern the annulment proceedings. According to Annex A of P.O. No. 1, the procedural calendar was fixed as follows: by 21 August 2020, the Applicants shall submit their Reply on Annulment; by 11 September 2020, the Respondent shall submit its Rejoinder on Annulment; on 1 or 2 October 2020, the Pre-Organizational Meeting would take place if necessary; and the Hearing on Annulment (the \"**Hearing**\") shall take place on 12 and 13 October 2020 (remotely if necessary).\n\n17.\n\nOn 21 August 2020, the Applicants submitted their Reply on Annulment.\n\n18.\n\nOn 7 September 2020, under Section 17.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Committee confirmed that the Hearing would be held remotely by videoconference given that a hearing in person was not feasible due to the restrictions resulting from Covid-19. The Committee also decided that it was unnecessary to hold the pre-hearing conference and decided on the Hearing schedule considering the Parties' positions on the schedule.\n\n19.\n\nOn 16 September 2020, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n20.\n\nOn 5 October 2020, after consulting the Parties, the Committee issued the \"Protocol Regarding Remote Hearing Matters.\"\n\n21.\n\nThe Hearing took place on 12 and 13 October 2020 by video conference.\n\n22.\n\nThe following persons attended the Hearing:\n\n*Committee:*\n\nMr. Eduardo Zuleta President  \nDr. Nudrat E. Piracha Arbitrator  \nProf. Giorgio Sacerdoti Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat:*\n\nMs. Martina Polasek Secretary of the Committee  \nMs. Lamiss Al-Tashi Hearings & Events Organizer  \nMs. Ekaterina Minina Paralegal  \nMr. Jeremy Stephen Myers Technician  \nMr. Emebet Alemu Demissie Technician  \nMs. Olivia Le Menestrel Intern\n\n*For the Applicants:*\n\nDr. Christopher Harris QC 3 Verulam Buildings  \nDr. Cameron Miles 3 Verulam Buildings  \nMs. Rhiannon Price Bird & Bird LLP  \nMr. Raymond Eyre Montrose Global Aircraft Management\n\n*For the Respondent:*\n\nMr. Ricky Diwan QC Essex Court Chambers  \nMr. John Whittaker Clyde & Co LLP  \nMs. Sophie Morrison Clyde & Co LLP  \nMs. Sarah Hill-Smith Clyde & Co LLP  \nMr. Milinda Gunetilleke Attorney General's Department  \nMr. Nirmalan Wigneswaran Attorney General's Department  \nMs. Anusha Jayatilake Attorney General's Department  \nSri Lanka Land Reclamation and  \nC.B Amarasinghe Development Corporation  \n Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and  \nH.K.K.W.

The Committee ruled that no submissions on the allocations of costs were necessary.\n\n**IV. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn their Application for Annulment, the Applicants requested the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, arguing that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by deciding in the Award, as a matter of law and treaty interpretation, that the Montrose Share did not qualify as an investment because the Montrose Land was not an investment itself and therefore Montrose Sri Lanka did not hold a qualifying investment (the \"**Applicants' Primary Case**\").\n\n25.\n\nDuring the proceedings regarding the stay of enforcement of the Award, the Respondent contended that Montrose Sri Lanka is not a proper Applicant to the annulment proceedings because it did not challenge the determination in the Award that the Montrose Land was not an investment. The Applicants counter this position (the \"**Standing Issue**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 25 June 2020, in its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, the Respondent submitted that the Applicants' Primary Case is based on a flawed reading of the Award because the Tribunal did not conclude, as a finding of law, that the Montrose Share was not an investment. The Tribunal's decision was based on a finding of facts.\n\n27.\n\nAfter the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, by letter dated 30 June 2020, the Applicants raised additional grounds for the annulment of the Award and informed the Committee that \"they will develop fully these arguments in their Reply Memorial.\"3 As advanced by the Applicants, their alternative case was developed in the Reply on Annulment, requesting the annulment of the Award based on Article 52(1)(b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention (the \"**Applicants' Alternative Case**\").\n\nLetter from Dr Cameron Miles to the Tribunal, 30 June 2020, p. 3.\n\n28.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial on Annulment and the Rejoinder on Annulment, the Respondent contended that the Applicants waived their right and/or are time barred to present additional grounds for annulment not included in the Application (the \"**Waiver Issue**\"). The Applicants counter this position.\n\n29.\n\nFor the sake of clarity and conciseness, in view of the positions raised by the Parties throughout the annulment proceedings, the Committee will present the Parties' positions under the following headings: (A) the Standing Issue, (B) the Applicants' Primary Case, (C) the Waiver Issue, and (D) the Applicants' Alternative Case.\n\n**A. The Standing Issue**\n-------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Applicants counter the Respondent's position regarding Montrose Sri Lanka's standing as an applicant in the present proceedings. The Applicants remark that they both presented the Annulment and Stay Applications and that they both seek the total annulment of the Award. The Applicants further claim that jurisdictional determinations cannot be partially annulled. Even if a partial annulment were possible, it would impact Montrose's obligations under the Award.4\n\nApplicants' Reply on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, p. 2-3.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Montrose Sri Lanka has no standing to appear as an applicant in the present annulment proceedings because in the Application it raised no ground to challenge the determination in the Award that it had no investment protected under the BIT. Therefore, Montrose Sri Lanka must comply with the Award.5\n\nRespondent's Response to Applicants' Request to Stay the Enforcement of the Award, 25 June 2020, \u00b6 59.\n\n**B. The Applicants' Primary Case**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Applicants' Primary Case refers to the conclusion reached by the Tribunal in the Award to the effect that the Montrose Share could only qualify as a protected investment under Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention if Montrose Sri Lanka itself had a protected investment in the Hotel Project or the Montrose Land. According to the Applicants, such interpretation is wrong in law, and the Award must be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.6\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 29-39; Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 38.\n\n***(a) Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAs to interpreting the ground of \"manifest excess of power\" set out in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Applicants contend that an award may be annulled under this ground where a tribunal fails to exercise a jurisdiction it possesses.7 For an award to be annulled, the error of jurisdiction must be manifest,8 which means that it must be \"obvious by itself.\"9 Manifest excess does not mean, however, that the excess must \"leap out of the page on a first reading of the award,\" given that \"[t]he reasoning in a case may be so complex that a degree of inquiry and analysis is required before it is clear precisely what the tribunal has decided.\"10\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 28.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 9.\n\nSee Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 9, where the Applicants refer to *EDF International SA, SAUR International SA & Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas SA v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/23 (Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016) \u00b6 193 (**ALA-11**).\n\n34.\n\nThe Applicants submit that the Respondent errs when it implies that jurisdictional determinations of law and fact cannot be challenged under Article 52(1)(b). To support their position, the Applicants refer to the decision on annulment in *Occidental v. Ecuador* to argue that \"[j]urisdictional excess of powers requires a finding that the tribunal has misconstrued the applicable law (e.g. the law regulating ownership of a protected investment) or has wrongly established the relevant facts (e.g., whether an investor actually controls an investment).\" Such excess must be manifest.11\n\nSee Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13, where the Applicants refer to *Occidental Petroleum Corporation & Occidental Exploration and Production Company v Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/11 (Decision on Annulment of the Award, 2 November 2015) \u00b6 51 (**ALA-13**).\n\n35.\n\nThe Applicants contend that just because another case or cases support a tribunal's approach to the law, it does not follow *ipso facto* that an award should not be annulled.12\n\nSee Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 13, where the Applicants refer to V Djanic & SW Schill, 'Article 52(1)(b)', in J Fouret et al (eds), The ICSID Convention, Regulations and Rules: A Practical Commentary (Edward Elgar 2019) \u00b6 4.1015 (**ALA-16**).\n\n36.\n\nWhile the Applicants acknowledge that a certain deference should be paid to a tribunal's findings, such deference is limited and should not substitute the Committee's independent analysis.13\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 16.\n\n***(b) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by declining its jurisdiction ratione materiae under a wrong finding of law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nFor the Applicants, the Tribunal's decision to decline its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is based on the incorrect premise that a share in a company can only be considered an investment if that company itself owns an investment. It is the only decision of which the Applicants are aware that adopted such an approach.14\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 35.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal's approach is contrary to the express wording of the BIT, which in Article 1(a)(ii) provides that an \"investment\" means \"every kind of asset and in particular, though not exclusively [\u2026] shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the property of such companies\". Article 1(a)(ii) includes no condition that the company in question owns a protected investment itself.15\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 36.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is also inconsistent with the wording of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. While some tribunals have sought to introduce into Article 25(1) an \"inherent meaning\" of the word \"investment,\" that test does not require that, where an investment consists of shares in a company, the investor must satisfy the requirements of Article 25(1) not only for the shares but also with respect to any assets the company holds.16\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 37.\n\n40.\n\nAccording to the Applicants, the Tribunal's error is clearly and unambiguously communicated in paragraph 292 of the Award, which states that \"the Montrose Share can qualify as a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and BIT only if Montrose itself has a protected investment in the planned Hotel Project on the Montrose Land.\"17\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 39, referring to Award, \u00b6 292.\n\n41.\n\nOn the other hand, the Applicants object to the Respondent's reading of the Award; namely, that the Tribunal's finding on the Montrose Share and the Montrose Land is a finding of facts, not of law. The Applicants argue that such reading is untenable for two reasons: (i) the jurisdictional objection that Sri Lanka now claims the Tribunal upheld in the Award was never raised in terms; and (ii) even if the objection had been raised, an examination of the relevant part of the Tribunal's reasoning shows that this was not the point being addressed.\n\n42.\n\nAs to the first point, the Applicants contend that the Respondent wrongfully claims that in the Award, the Tribunal upheld Sri Lanka's jurisdictional objection that the Applicant's claim concerning the Montrose Share was parasitic on their claim for the Montrose Land when applying the *Salini* test. That is because Sri Lanka never raised such objection in terms. The references pointed out by the Respondent in its Reply on Jurisdiction, in the transcript of the oral hearings, and in its Post-Hearing Brief refer to a different objection: that the Montrose Land was owned by Electro Resorts and that neither Mr Eyre nor Montrose Sri Lanka could bring a claim before the Tribunal because Mr Eyre's indirect rights were parasitic on Montrose Sri Lanka's direct rights on the Montrose Land. Said objection was not addressing the *Salini* factors \u2013as claimed by the Respondent\u2013, but the question of who owned the Montrose Land.18\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 45-53.\n\n43.\n\nAs to the second point, the Applicants argue that even if Sri Lanka objected in the terms it now claims, the terms of the Award make clear that the Tribunal was not upholding such objection. Sri Lanka's submission is that after the Tribunal had considered Mr Eyre's contributions to the Montrose Land and Hotel Project and found them wanting for lack of investment risk, \"no independent factual basis existed for the Montrose Share to constitute an 'investment' and it fell away for precisely the same reasons.\"19 If this were the reasoning of the Tribunal, it would have had to consider every individual item that Mr Eyre relied on to establish contribution and investment risk when considering the Montrose Land and Hotel Project and found each of them lacking, so there was \"no independent factual basis\" remaining for the Montrose Share to stand as an investment.20 The Tribunal, however, did not consider every item in paragraph 296 of the Award, where it listed Mr Eyre's contributions. In the said paragraph, the Tribunal did not refer to Mr Eyre's contributions in \"(a) establishing and operating a Sri Lankan company from 2010 onwards, and/or (b) directing that company's activities before Sri Lanka's Land Acquisition Board after the Montrose Land was expropriated.\"21 For the Applicants, the Tribunal saw no need to examine these contributions because it was operating on the footing that unless that company had an investment of its own in the Montrose Land, the Montrose Share could not constitute an investment.22\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 55.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 56.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 60.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 61.\n\n44.\n\nFinally, the Applicants note that Sri Lanka did not even attempt to counter the Applicants' position under their reading of the Award. This omission is tantamount to an admission that, if the Applicants are right in their reading of the Award, the annulment must necessarily follow.23\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 40.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n***(a) Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent begins by noting that it is \"not within the powers of an annulment committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the conclusions of the Tribunal and to substitute its judgment on jurisdictional requirements (including treaty interpretation), the interpretation of the law and/or the assessment of the facts. The committee may only assess whether, in reaching its conclusion, the tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\"24\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, 25 June 2020, \u00b6 17.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent defines the contours of Article 52(1)(b) by indicating that fact-findings and the weighing of evidence made by tribunals are outside the scope of review of an *ad hoc* committee unless the applicant can prove that the errors of fact-finding committed by the tribunal are egregious and irrational.25 Likewise, an alleged wrong application or interpretation of the law is not a ground for annulment unless the misinterpretation or misapplication is so gross or egregious as substantially to amount to a failure to apply the proper law.26 These rules apply to any contention regarding manifest excess of jurisdiction.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 94.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n47.\n\nThe erroneous application of law must be distinguished from its non-application. The former does not lead to an excess of power.27 This approach constitutes *jurisprudence constante*. The contrary approach would constitute a *de novo* review of the case, which would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and to its drafting history.28\n\nSee Rejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 101, referring to *Tenaris S.A. and Talta v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Decision on Annulment of 28 December 2018 at \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55 (**RL-4**).\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Applicants' contention that if the Tribunal whose award is under challenge rules in a similar manner as a previous tribunal has ruled on the matter, the possibility of a manifest excess of power is excluded. If a prior tribunal has interpreted or applied a treaty term or concept in a similar manner to that of the Tribunal, it would be virtually impossible to say that the Tribunal has acted in a way that no reasonable person could have acted. To support its position, the Respondent refers to the annulment decisions in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* and *SGS v. Paraguay*.29\n\nSee Rejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 104-105, referring to *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on Annulment of 21 February 2014 at \u00b6\u00b6 163-167 (**RL-24**), and *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Annulment, 19 May 2014 at \u00b6\u00b6 114-122 (**RL-20**).\n\n49.\n\nThe degree of inquiry required to determine whether a tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers must be analysed on two levels: (i) the level of analysis required to understand the decision; and (ii) once understood, the level of ease with which the excess of power can be detected. In respect of the latter, it should not be necessary to resort to complex argumentation and analysis to find the existence of an excess of power.30 As recognized in *SGS v. Paraguay*, an excess of power must be manifest and thus must be easily perceived, self-evident, and not the result from extensive interpretation.31\n\nSee Rejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 110-112, referring to *Tenaris S.A. and Talta v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Decision on Annulment of 28 December 2018 at \u00b6 76-80 (**RL-4**).\n\nSee Rejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 111, referring to *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, Decision on Annulment, 19 May 2014 at \u00b6\u00b6 114-119 (**RL-20**).\n\n50.\n\nFinally, the Respondent remarks that the ground for annulment provided for in Article 52(1)(b) must be distinguished from the one set out in Article 52(1)(e). Thus, the Applicants cannot seek to introduce into Article 52(1)(b) an attack on reasoning referring to the failure to state reasons in the award, falling under Article 52(1)(e).32 Yet, as analysed *infra*,33 the Respondent contends that the Applicants waived their right to invoke Article 52(1)(e), as they did not raise this ground in the Application for Annulment.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, 25 June 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 22-28.\n\nSee Section IV(C)(2).\n\n***(b) The Applicants' reading of the Award is incorrect***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Applicants' Primary Case is flawed because it constitutes a fundamental misreading of the Award.34\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 3.\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicants' Primary Case is that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention by allegedly interpreting Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention at paragraph 306 of the Award as requiring that an investor in shares must establish in law \u2013 as a condition precedent\u2013 that the assets of the company qualify as an investment.35 For the Respondent, such reading of the Award is wrong. In paragraph 306 of the Award, the Tribunal rejected the claim that the Montrose Share constituted an investment on the facts. It did so because the determination that the Montrose Land was not an investment was outcome determinative of the issue as a matter of fact and not of treaty interpretation.36\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 2.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 3.\n\n53.\n\nThe only issue of treaty interpretation in dispute between the Parties was whether the term investment as used in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1 of the BIT had an inherent meaning.37\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 27-32.\n\n54.\n\nThe treaty interpretation case advanced by the Applicants as their Primary Case was not raised by either party before the Tribunal. It is implausible that the Tribunal decided a point of treaty interpretation not argued by the Parties and without allowing them to address it. Consequently, the Respondent declines to engage in an alleged case of treaty interpretation that was never argued or decided by the Tribunal.38\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 45.\n\n55.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Tribunal failed to address each contribution relied upon by them, referring to two items omitted from the list contained in paragraph 296 of the Award. That is a complaint regarding the Tribunal's reasoning and demonstrates that the Tribunal was addressing a factual question, not a treaty interpretation question.39\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 56-58.\n\n56.\n\nThe scheme of the Award follows the scheme of the Parties' arguments. First, it defined the issue of interpretation regarding the inherent meaning of the term \"investment\" in paragraphs 293 and 294 of the Award. Then, it applied that treaty interpretation to the Montrose Land and the Montrose Share, as set out in paragraphs 296 to 306 of the Award. The conclusion at paragraph 306 that the Montrose Share did not qualify as an investment since the Montrose Land did not qualify as an investment was an application of the term investment to the facts.40 If the Montrose Land did not constitute an investment, there was no basis on which the Montrose Share was capable of being an investment. Indeed, no independent basis was contended for the Montrose Share being an investment.41\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 33-41, 48-51.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 6.\n\n57.\n\nFinally, the Respondent considers that the Applicants miss the point by arguing that during the arbitration proceedings the Respondent did not use the term \"parasitic\" in the specific context of the application of the *Salini* factors to the issue of whether the Montrose Share was an investment. The point is that the Respondent specifically refuted the Applicant's contentions that the inherent meaning of the term \"investment\" had been satisfied on the facts. According to the Respondent, if Montrose Sri Lanka did not own the Montrose Land, the Montrose Share claim would fail as being \"parasitic\" because if the company had no assets and hence no investment, the elements of the Salini Test would not be complied with. The same would apply if the only asset of the company bore no investment risk.42 The Respondent claims that, in any event, it also separately stated in the arbitration proceedings that if there was no investment in the Montrose Land, there would be no investment in the Montrose Share because it was parasitic.43\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.\n\n**C. The Waiver Issue**\n-----------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Applicants counter the Respondent's contention that they \"waived their right to advance any such new ground,\" referring to the Alternative Case raised by the Applicants after the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial. For the Applicants, it is wrong to conclude that \"once an application for annulment is lodged, the applicant's position is set in stone and any and all other grounds are deemed waived.\"44\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 135.\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicants note that the only express limitation on raising grounds of annulment is the 120 days set forth in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention. The Applicants raised both of their grounds for annulment (Articles 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e)) within that 120-day time limit. The Award is dated 5 March 2020, meaning the 120 days expired on 3 July 2020. The first ground was raised in the Application dated 1 May 2020, and the second ground was raised in the letter dated 30 June 2020.45 In any event, it is permissible that an applicant advances new arguments regarding existing grounds even after the 120-day time limit has elapsed.46\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 136, 138.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 138, referring to RL-15, Schreuer et al, ICSID Commentary, 929 (**RL-15**) and *Wena Hotels Ltd v Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No ARB/98/4 (Decision on the Application by the Arab Republic of Egypt, 5 February 2002) \u00b6 19 (**ALA-18**).\n\n60.\n\nThe Applicants argue that Sri Lanka's opposition to the Additional Points is ironical. In the underlying arbitration, Sri Lanka sought to introduce three new jurisdictional objections in its Reply on Jurisdiction, months after the deadline set in various provisions of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Although the Applicants argued that these new objections should be excluded, they were admitted by the Tribunal.\n\n61.\n\nAlbeit Sri Lanka contends that Mr Eyre waived his right to raise additional points for the annulment of the Award by raising solely one ground in the Application, Sri Lanka fails to mention the crucial fact that the Application proceeded on the assumption that the meaning of the Award dealing with the Montrose Share would be common ground. Mr Eyre's additional points have been raised as a direct response to Sri Lanka's proposed reading of the Award. Moreover, Mr Eyre did not state unequivocally that he waived his right to raise further grounds or arguments about annulment if the need arose.47\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 152-157.\n\n62.\n\nLikewise, Montrose Sri Lanka did not waive its right to present its own basis for annulment in the Application. As made clear by the words \"the Applicants have limited their application to a single particularly egregious example of procedural error\", the Applicants gave themselves the freedom to change their position in later pleadings if they saw fit, provided that such change was not unduly prejudicial to Sri Lanka.48 Such prejudice has not been alleged.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 158-160.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Applicants waived their right and/or are time barred to present their Alternative Case by not stating such claim in the Application for Annulment.49\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 6-7.\n\n64.\n\nFor the Respondent, neither the language nor the object and purpose of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention support the Applicants' position.\n\n65.\n\nRegarding the language, Article 52 provides for a single application for annulment to be made within a time limit of 120 days. It does not permit multiple applications or the amendment of an application made within the 120-day time limit.50 Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention reinforces the above because it specifically excludes the application of Article 46 \u2013 which permitted the Tribunal to determine an incidental or additional claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided the claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and the jurisdiction of ICSID \u2013to proceedings before the Annulment Committee. It therefore excludes the right to determine any incidental or additional claims in annulment proceedings.51\n\nTranscript of Oral Hearing, 12 October 2020, p. 158: 6-18.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 64.\n\n66.\n\nRegarding object and purpose, Article 52 is intended to be limited to the control of the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process, imposing a high threshold. If there is a glaring error that goes to fundamental integrity, it will be obvious, and an applicant does not need and should not have more than one shot at raising it.52\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 65.\n\n67.\n\nTo support its case, the Respondent relies on Professor Schreuer's comments on the ICSID Convention to reject the contention that a party can amend an annulment application to assert new grounds for annulment not contained in the original annulment application.53 It also rejects the application of the reasoning in *Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* given that is not a case concerned with waiver.54\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 65.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 70.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent counters the Applicants' position that they can simply suggest an intention to add new grounds to their Annulment Application within the 120-day time limit to comply with the 120-day limit.55\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 75.\n\n69.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that paragraph 3 of the Annulment Application contains an express waiver by Montrose Sri Lanka that it is not pursuing any other ground for annulment and an express choice by Mr Eyre to pursue only one ground for annulment being the alleged question of treaty interpretation concerning the Montrose Share, thus expressly waiving all other grounds for objection. Indeed, it was made clear that all other potential grounds for annulment were not being pursued.56\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 78.\n\n70.\n\nIn the Application, Montrose Sri Lanka made expressly clear that it was not challenging the determination that the Montrose Land was not an investment. It therefore expressly waived any right to pursue any ground of annulment relating to the Montrose Land. Likewise, Mr Eyre expressly waived pursuing any unity of investment/investment risk argument [REDACTED].57\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 81-84.\n\n71.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Respondent rejects the Applicants' reliance upon the letter of 30 June 2020 to include a new ground for the annulment of the Award.58\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 84.\n\n72.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that there is no justification for the Applicants' position that they could not have predicted the Respondent's interpretation of the Award.59\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 84.\n\n**D. The Applicants' Alternative Case**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Applicants' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Applicants argue that even if the Committee agreed with Sri Lanka's reading of the Award, such reading reveals yet further annullable errors under Articles 52(1)(b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention.60\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 65.\n\n74.\n\nThe Applicants request the annulment of the Award based on the following grounds: (i) that the Tribunal failed to apply the principle of unity of investment to the Applicants' investment operation or alternatively did not properly explain its application; (ii) that the Tribunal failed to apply the concept of investment risk to the Applicants' investment operation or alternatively did not properly explain its application; and (iii) that the Tribunal ignored evidence material to the Applicants' case and on which the Applicants placed considerable reliance or alternatively failed to explain how it took account of that evidence.\n\n75.\n\nAs to the first ground, the Applicants note that the Tribunal manifestly failed to apply the unity of investment principle to the Applicants' investment operation, which requires that an investment operation consisting of multiple transactions directed towards the same economic objective be assessed as a whole.61 Had the Tribunal applied unity of investment or addressed the Applicants' investment operation as actually pleaded, [REDACTED].62\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 115.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 118.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal's failure to apply unity of investment led it wrongfully to decline jurisdiction. This failure constitutes an excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, given that the Tribunal misconstrued the applicable law and wrongly established the relevant facts.63 The Tribunal's failure also constitutes a failure to give reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e), considering that its reasoning on the matter of unity of investment is patently insufficient, and does not enable a reader to understand how this conclusion was reached.64\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 120, referring to *Occidental v Ecuador*, Decision on Annulment of the Award, \u00b6 51 (**ALA-13**).\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122.\n\n77.\n\nAs to the second ground,65 the Tribunal also failed to apply the concept of investment risk that it identified as relevant, viz. a situation wherein \"profits are not ascertained but depend on the success or failure of the economic venture concerned\".66 The Tribunal failed to apply this standard in two respects: (i) it failed to apply it to the acquisition of the Montrose Land, which it characterised as 'bare' and therefore acquired without investment risk. In so doing, it failed to apprehend the nature of land as an asset that is invariably acquired as an investment in its own right; (ii) it failed to apply its own standard to the Hotel Project itself. Rather, it applied the doctrine of pre-investment expenditure.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 123-128.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 123.\n\n78.\n\nThese failures led the Tribunal to decline its jurisdiction, which is a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention and produced further annullable errors for the purpose of Article 52(1)(e). For the Applicants, it is not possible to determine on the face of the Award why a purchase of land cannot be considered an investment risk, given that (a) land is often held for an extended period of time in the hopes that its value will increase, and (b) the Montrose Land, in this case, was acquired by the Applicants expressly to pursue the Hotel Project. It is equally impossible to determine why the Tribunal (a) applied the concept of pre-investment expenditure to the Hotel Project when it said it was applying investment risk, and (b) applied pre-investment expenditure at all when the Applicants had acquired assets within Sri Lanka that took them out of the pre-investment phase of their project.67\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 126-128.\n\n79.\n\nAs to the distinction between pre-investment and investment, the Applicants note that \"there is no good reason as to why the signing of a contract should be the tipping point between pre-investment activity and an investment proper.\"68 While it might be argued that the proposed development would never have occurred or is overvalued, these points are relevant for the merits or the quantum phase of the proceedings. They have no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.69\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 112.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 113.\n\n80.\n\nAs to the third ground, the Applicants claim that the Tribunal failed to take account of evidence on which they placed conspicuous reliance, such as [REDACTED].70\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 129.\n\n81.\n\nThe Applicants rely on *TECO v. Guatemala* to contend that the Tribunal's decision may be annullable under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, given it ignored material evidence that the parties deemed highly relevant to their case and, even if it found it of no assistance, it did not set out the reasons for this conclusion.71 For these grave failures to take account of evidence too, the Award must be annulled under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.72\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 130.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 131-133.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicants are engaged in an attempt at appellate review and not annulment73 and counters their contentions regarding (i) the alleged unity of investment principle, and (ii) the investment risk.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 18.\n\n83.\n\nAs to the unity of investment, the Respondent counters the Applicants' position that the Tribunal failed to correctly apply the unity of investment principle, which constitutes a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) for the reasons described below.74\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 45-54.\n\n84.\n\nFirst, this is not a case of non-application. The Tribunal considered and applied the unity of investment principle, but it rejected it on the facts in paragraph 301 of the Award.75\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 19(1).\n\n85.\n\nSecond, case-law demonstrates that unity of investment gives substantive investment protection to an overall investment project provided that the investor can identify an investment within the overall investment project, and unity of investment does not elevate individual components of an alleged investment into an investment looked at as a whole if none of the components themselves can constitute an investment.76\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 19(2)\n\n86.\n\nThird, there is nothing egregious in the Tribunal's findings regarding the application of the unity of investment principle to the Montrose Land and the Montrose Share so that no reasonable person could have shared the Tribunal's view.77\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 19(3).\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent further objects to the application of Article 52(1)(e) to annul the Award because there is no difficulty in understanding the Tribunal's reasoning.78\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 20.\n\n88.\n\nAs to the investment risk, the Respondent objects to the Applicants' position that the Tribunal failed to apply the principle of investment risk correctly and that this is tantamount to a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b), for the reasons set out below.79\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 54-64.\n\n89.\n\nFirst, this is not a case of non-application of the law. At paragraphs 300 and 301 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that the Montrose Land as bare land bore no investment risk as opposed to commercial risk, absent specific commitments and arrangements towards the aspirational Hotel Project involving financial cost with risk and possible benefit. Therefore, this is not a case of non-application of the investment risk principle and is instead an attempt at an appellate review.80\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 21(1).\n\n90.\n\nSecond, case law has distinguished between investment risk and commercial risk, and there is no basis for impugning the Tribunal's decision as constituting a manifest excess of power.81\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 21(2).\n\n91.\n\nThird, there is nothing egregious in the Tribunal's application of the principle such that no reasonable person could have shared the Tribunal's view.82\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 21(3).\n\n92.\n\nAs to the Applicants' contention regarding the failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e), the Respondent alleges that it is misconceived because: (i) there is no difficulty in understanding the Tribunal's reasoning; and (ii) the Applicants' complaint that the Tribunal failed to expressly refer to the payment of stamp duty and the additional payment to get clean title for the land is irrelevant. For the Respondent, \"[t]his was not outcome determinative evidence since it stood and fell with: a) the absence of investment risk; b) the determination that even if there had been payment for the Land, it would not have converted the acquisition into an investment. The Tribunal was under no obligation to refer to these two alleged contributions, which added nothing to the Applicants' case based on the Tribunal's analysis of investment risk and contribution.\"83\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 22(2).\n\n**V. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The Standing Issue**\n-------------------------\n\n93.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Committee must decide on the Respondent's contention that Montrose Sri Lanka has no standing to appear as applicant in the present annulment proceedings because in the Application, it raised no ground to challenge the determination in the Award that it had no investment protected under the BIT.84\n\nRespondent's Response to Applicants' Request to Stay the Enforcement of the Award, 25 June 2020, \u00b6 59.\n\n94.\n\nThe Committee considers that there is no reason to uphold the Respondent's position.\n\n95.\n\nFirst, it is undisputed that both Mr Eyre and Montrose Sri Lanka participated as claimants in the underlying arbitration. Therefore, both Applicants were entitled to request the annulment of the Award under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n96.\n\nSecond, it is clear from the Application and subsequent memorials that both Mr Eyre and Montrose Sri Lanka are requesting the annulment of the Award. The fact that the Applicants pleaded a single ground for annulment as their Primary Case \u2013not related to the Tribunal's determination that Montrose Sri Lanka did not have a protected investment under the BIT\u2013does not mean that Montrose Sri Lanka has no standing to request the annulment of the Award.\n\n97.\n\nConsequently, the Committee concludes that Montrose Sri Lanka does have standing in the present proceedings to request the annulment of the Award.\n\n**B. The Waiver Issue**\n-----------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Parties in their submissions have raised the following issues: (a) whether the Applicants expressly waived their right to raise further grounds and/or arguments; (b) if not, were the Applicants time barred from raising new grounds given that the 120-day period for submission of the Annulment Application had not yet expired; (c) whether the Applicants raised new grounds or arguments; and (d) whether there exists any legal basis for amending the original Annulment Application.\n\n99.\n\nGiven that the decision regarding the so called \"waiver\" or the time bar limitation referred to in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention directly affects the admissibility of the Applicants' Alternative Case, the Committee will decide first whether the Applicants waived their right and/or are time barred to request the annulment of the Award under the grounds and reasoning presented in their Alternative Case.\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Applicants waived their right to present the Alternative Case by not stating such claim in the Application for Annulment.85 For the Respondent, neither the language nor the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention allow an applicant to present new grounds after the application for annulment has been submitted.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 6-7.\n\n101.\n\nOn the other hand, the Applicants claim that nothing in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules support the Respondent's position. Article 52 of the ICSID Convention sets out a 120-day limit for presenting the grounds for annulment, and the Applicants did so within this time limit given that this term expired on 3 July 2020, and the Applicants raised their Alternative Case on 30 June 2020. The Applicants further argue that the ICSID Convention does not rule out the possibility of amending an annulment application. It is precisely what the Applicants did: they supplemented their existing Application.86 Furthermore, Sri Lanka has raised no serious complaint that they are prejudiced by the Applicants being able to run the Alternative Case.87 Finally, the Applicants note that it was not possible for them to anticipate the Respondent's reading of the Award.88\n\nTranscript of Oral Hearing, 12 October 2020, p. 83: 23-25, p. 84: 1-18.\n\nTranscript of Oral Hearing, 12 October 2020, p. 82: 22-25.\n\nTranscript of Oral Hearing, 12 October 2020, p. 86: 4-17.\n\n102.\n\nGiven the positions advanced by the Parties, the central question faced by the Committee is whether the Applicants may, within the 120-day time limit set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention but after the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, amend their Application for Annulment to introduce new grounds that were not raised in the original Application,89 or whether by not stating the Alternative Case in the original Application, the Applicants waived their right and/or are time barred to do so.\n\nThe Committee notes that, as agreed by the Parties, and embodied in Procedural Order No. 1 and the Procedural Calendar, the Applicants decided that their Application for Annulment stands as their Memorial on Annulment.\n\n103.\n\nTo resolve this question, the Committee will first interpret the rules applicable to this annulment proceeding and, thereafter, apply said rules to the case at hand in the light of the facts presented by the Parties.\n\n104.\n\nThe main rules touched upon by the Parties are Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n105.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention provides in its relevant part as follows:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n*(2) The application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered except that when annulment is requested on the ground of corruption such application shall be made within 120 days after discovery of the corruption and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(4) The provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings before the Committee.*\n\n106.\n\nIn turn, Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides, in its relevant part, that:\n\n*(1) An application for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award shall be addressed in writing to the Secretary-General and shall: [\u2026]*\n\n*(c) state in detail: [\u2026]*\n\n*(iii) in an application for annulment, pursuant to Article 52(1) of the Convention, the grounds on which it is based. These grounds are limited to the following:*\n\n*- that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*- that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*- that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*- that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;*\n\n*- that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based;*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(3) The Secretary-General shall refuse to register an application for: [\u2026]*\n\n*(b) annulment, if, in accordance with Article 52(2) of the Convention, it is not made:*\n\n*(i) within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered (or any subsequent decision or correction) if the application is based on any of the following grounds:*\n\n*\u2013 the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*\u2013 the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*\u2013 there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;*\n\n*\u2013 the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based;*\n\n*(ii) in the case of corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal, within 120 days after discovery thereof, and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered (or any subsequent decision or correction).*\n\n107.\n\nThe Committee must interpret the ICSID Convention in the light of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1961 (the \"**VCLT**\"), reflecting customary international law.90 When interpreting Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the ICSID Convention, the Committee observes that:\n\n\u2022 The \"application\" for annulment referred to in both provisions is set out in singular. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules provide for multiple applications. The applicant to an annulment therefore may present only one application.\n\n\u2022 The application must be presented in writing, must be addressed to the Secretary-General, and must invoke one or more grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. Such grounds shall be stated in detail.\n\n\u2022 The 120-day limit set out in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention imposes a time limit to request the annulment after the award has been issued. Conversely, when the corruption of a member of the tribunal is invoked as a ground for annulment, the 120-day time limit does not begin counting after the award is rendered but after the discovery of corruption. This distinction evidences that the shortcomings of an award engaging one or more of the grounds set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (d), or (e) of Article 52(1) must be identified by the applicants as soon as the award is rendered and, in any event, within the aforementioned 120 days.\n\n\u2022 Compliance with the 120-day limit is a *sine qua non* requisite to register an application for annulment. Under Rule 50(3)(b) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General shall refuse to register an application for annulment if it is not made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered when the application is based on paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. The verb \"shall\" indicates that it is mandatory\u2013not discretional\u2013for the Secretary-General to verify compliance with the 120-day time limit.\n\nVCLT, Article 31:  \n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.  \n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:  \n(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;  \n(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.  \n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:  \n(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of  \nthe treaty or the application of its provisions;  \n(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;  \n(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.  \n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n108.\n\nThe Parties repeatedly invoked as an authoritative source of doctrine the comment on Article 52 in \"*The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\"*, written by Christoph H. Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch, and Anthony Sinclair. The Committee will refer hereunder to Professor Schreuer et al.' comments regarding the substantiation of the application for annulment and the limitations to the grounds advanced by the Parties.\n\n109.\n\nFirst, there is no *ex officio* annulment of awards. A request for annulment is discretionary and the applicant may decide whether or not to apply for annulment and on what grounds it wishes to base its application.91 The annulment application cannot be made in the form of a simple general assertion that one or more of the five grounds for annulment set out in Article 52(1) is engaged but should also state what features of the award exhibit flaws constituting grounds for annulment.92\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), p. 1052, \u00b6 531.\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), p. 927, \u00b6 87.\n\n110.\n\nSecond, \"a request for annulment directed at certain shortcomings and based on certain grounds for annulment may be seen as a waiver of any right to request annulment based on other defects or other grounds.\"93\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), p. 1053, \u00b6 534.\n\n111.\n\nThird, the grounds for annulment invoked in the application may be further developed in the course of the proceedings.94 Yet, a party may not amend its application in the course of the proceedings \"on points that were known to it but which it failed to raise in the original application\" unless new unknown facts come to light. This prohibition follows either from the understanding that there has been an implicit waiver or from the 120-day time limit.95\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), p. 1053, \u00b6 531.\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), p. 1053, \u00b6 535.\n\n112.\n\nFourth, an incorrect classification of a defective feature of the award in terms of the grounds provided in Article 52(1) should not lead to the denial of the annulment. The applicant should be allowed to develop its application and reclassify the alleged defect. The *ad hoc* Committee has the authority to annul the award under a different ground, \"as long as the incriminated defect has been pleaded as a basis for annulment by a party.\"96 Yet, \"[a] Committee may not annul unless it is asked to do so by a party even if it comes to the conclusion that, objectively, there is a ground for annulment.\"97\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), p. 1054, \u00b6 538.\n\nSchreuer et al., The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition (**RL-15**(**A**)), pp. 1054, \u00b6 536.\n\n113.\n\nThe Parties also invoked the annulment decision in *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* as relevant to the decision to be taken by the Committee in this annulment case.\n\n114.\n\nThe relevant legal issue discussed in *Soufraki* is whether \"all the grounds for annulment were properly introduced in the Application,\" considering that, \"because of the existence of strict time limit in the ICSID Convention, a new ground for annulment cannot in principle be admitted in the course of the proceedings, while of course new arguments fleshing out grounds already admitted can be developed.\"98\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 (**RL-1**), \u00b6 33\n\n115.\n\nIn his request for annulment, Mr Soufraki invoked Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, claiming that the tribunal exceeded its powers by (i) exercising a jurisdiction it did not possess by reviewing the decisions of the Italian authorities in the application of Italian nationality laws, and by (ii) declining to exercise jurisdiction it did possess by determining the merits of the claim. Also, the applicant invoked Article 52(1)(e), claiming that the tribunal provided no legal basis for its decision to apply Italian nationality law. In its subsequent submissions, the applicant developed the arguments classified under the first ground of annulment but also presented a third complaint under the heading of \"manifest excess of power\"; namely, that the tribunal failed to apply the proper law to the determination of Mr Soufraki's nationality.\n\n116.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee analysed whether the contention that the Tribunal also exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law, as presented in the Claimant's Memorial, was a new ground for annulment, or whether it could be considered as encompassed in the annulment application.99 The *ad hoc* committee found that the application included a reference to both the tribunal's lack of power to determine the claimant's nationality and the failure to apply the proper law when making such determination, under the following wording: \"[the tribunal] assumed a jurisdiction which it did not possess to apply Italian law in a manner radically at odds with the way it had been applied by the competent Italian authorities.\"100\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 (**RL-1**), \u00b6 34\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 (**RL-1**), \u00b6 34.\n\n117.\n\nTherefore, the *ad hoc* committee concluded that, although intermingled with the assumption that the tribunal had no jurisdiction to assess the claimant's nationality, the claim regarding the failure to apply the proper law was present in the annulment application.101 Accordingly, despite the changes in the presentation of Mr. Soufraki's allegations, \"four distinguishable, albeit sometimes overlapping, arguments have been made under the two grounds for annulment provided for in Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e).\"102 Namely, (1) whether the tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in exercising power it did not have by going behind the official nationality certificates to determine Mr Soufraki's nationality, (2) whether the tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to apply the proper law in the determination of Mr. Soufraki's nationality, (3) whether the tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in not exercising the power to ascertain the claim on the merits, and (4) whether the tribunal failed to state reasons in support of the conclusions reached in its award.103 Consequently, the *ad hoc* committee decided that the claimant's different grounds for annulment were admissible.\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 (**RL-1**), \u00b6 34.\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 (**RL-1**), \u00b6 35\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007 (**RL-1**), \u00b6 35.\n\n118.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee finds that the case at hand must be analysed in the light of the rules set out below, which follow from interpreting Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules:\n\n\u2022 An applicant may present a single annulment application, not multiple applications. The application must include all the grounds upon which the applicant relies to request the annulment, including the defective features of the Award engaging one of the grounds for annulment set out in Article 52(1). Such grounds should be stated in detail, as provided in Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n\u2022 An application for annulment based on the grounds provided in Article 52(1)(a), (b), (d), or (e) may only be requested within a time limit of 120 days after the Award is rendered.\n\n\u2022 An applicant cannot invoke new grounds based on new incriminating defects known to it but that it consciously decided not to raise in the application. An amendment of the application to include new grounds and new incriminating defects would only be acceptable if it is based on new facts that were not known to an applicant when the application was lodged.\n\n\u2022 An *ad hoc* committee may not annul an award under grounds, or incriminating defects that the parties have not pleaded, even if it concludes that objectively there is a ground for annulment.\n\n119.\n\nThe Committee will now turn to analyse the facts and specific circumstances in light of the criteria that follows from Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and the applicable Arbitration Rules.\n\n120.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Applicants made, expressly and unequivocally, specific statements in their Application regarding the scope and extent of such application.\n\n121.\n\nFirst, that they were requesting the annulment of the Award \"under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention because the Tribunal failed to exercise its jurisdiction \u2013 and in so doing manifestly exceeded its powers.\"104\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 24-39.\n\n122.\n\nSecond, that:\n\n*the Award is regrettably replete with serious failures to grapple with the evidence presented to the Tribunal, to the extent that some have even been picked up by the legal press: for example, the Tribunal's abject failure to deal with the evidence of a USD 400,000 contribution made by Mr Eyre. In recognition of the narrow compass of the annulment jurisdiction under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, however, the Applicants have limited their application (sic.) a single particularly egregious example of procedural error by the Tribunal \u2013 namely its refusal to exercise its jurisdiction on the basis that notwithstanding the clear word of the BIT, the share that Mr Eyre held in Montrose Sri Lanka did not qualify as an investment because Montrose Sri Lanka did not itself separately hold an investment.*105\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 3.\n\n123.\n\nThese statements are reaffirmed in the Application. Paragraph 22 of the Application states that:\n\n*[the] Application proceeds on one ground only: the Tribunal's erroneous rejection of jurisdiction ratione materiae over the Montrose Share, on the basis that Montrose Sri Lanka did not own a valid investment under Article 1(a) of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal appears to have invented its own, novel and unique additional requirement for an investment. Given that 'shares, stock and debentures of companies or interests in the properties of such companies' are expressly protected as investments in their own right under Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT without any reference to whether the companies to which the shares relate hold investments in their own right, this conclusion is wrong in principle and untenable.*106\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 26.\n\n124.\n\nThe Applicants contend that they did not waive their right to present new grounds not included in the Application because therein, they noted that the incriminating defect raised was merely an example of errors in the Award. Therefore they \"gave themselves the freedom to change their position in later pleadings if they saw fit.\"107 However, the Committee is not persuaded by this reasoning. The wording of the Application is unequivocal. The Applicants stated that, while the Award could be \"replete with serious failures to grapple with the evidence presented to the Tribunal,\" given the \"narrow compass of the annulment jurisdiction,\" the Applicants \"limited their application to a single particularly egregious example of procedural error.\" They confirmed that statement by indicating that they were applying for annulment \"on one ground only\". According to the Applicants, the only ground for which they were applying was a procedural error consisting of the Tribunal's decision to decline its jurisdiction based on the finding of law that the Montrose Share could not be considered an investment because Montrose Sri Lanka did not hold an investment itself.108 Therefore, the Applicants wilfully decided not to pursue the annulment of the Award under other grounds or incriminating defects of the Award despite expressly acknowledging that other \"serious failures\" could be found therein.\n\nReply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 159.\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 3.\n\n125.\n\nThe Committee further considers that upholding the Applicants' theory would allow any applicant to simply invoke one ground for annulment, characterize such ground as an example of the alleged flaws in the award, and in subsequent submissions during the annulment proceedings include any ground or any defective feature not originally included in the application. This would run contrary to the principles applicable to annulment proceedings explained in paragraphs 103 to 118 above.\n\n126.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that the Applicants expressly waived their right to request the annulment based on (1) other grounds different from Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and (2) other defective features of the Award different from the Tribunal's decision to decline its jurisdiction based on the alleged finding of law that the Montrose Share did not qualify as an investment if Montrose Sri Lanka did not itself hold an investment separately.\n\n127.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Committee must turn to analyse whether the grounds and incriminating defects raised in the Alternative Case may be considered as encompassed within the Primary Case presented in the Application. In other words, whether the Alternative Case is simply a development of the arguments presented in the Primary Case.\n\n128.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Professor Schreuer et al., and the *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki,* in that an applicant should be allowed to develop during the annulment proceedings the arguments supporting the grounds that it raised in the annulment application. An applicant should also be permitted to reclassify, under a different ground, an incriminating defect already classified under a particular ground in the annulment application.\n\n129.\n\nThe Committee observes that the case at hand is neither a case where the Applicants \"reclassified\" an incriminating defect under a ground raised but wrongly classified in the Application nor a case where the Applicants supplemented their claims under the Primary Case by presenting the Alternative Case. For the Committee, it is clear that the Alternative Case is based on grounds and alleged defects of the Award that the Applicants knew and that are different from the ones claimed by the Applicants in the Primary Case.\n\n130.\n\nOn the one hand, the Applicants' Primary Case, as pleaded in the Application and the Reply on Annulment, is based on only one incriminating defect: that the Tribunal declined to exercise its jurisdiction because it concluded \u2013as a matter of law\u2013 that the Montrose Share did not constitute an investment because Montrose Sri Lanka did not hold an investment itself. The ground invoked as a result of this alleged flaw is \"manifest excess of power\", set out in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n131.\n\nOn the other hand, the Applicants' Alternative Case, as pleaded in the letter dated 30 June 2020 and the Reply on Annulment, is based on the following alleged defects of the Award: (i) that the Tribunal failed to apply the principle of unity of investment to the Applicants' investment operation or alternatively did not properly explain its application, (ii) that the Tribunal failed to apply the concept of investment risk to the Applicants' investment operation or alternatively did not properly explain its application, and (iii) that the Tribunal ignored evidence material to the Applicants' case or alternatively failed to explain how it took account of that evidence. According to the Applicants, these failures led the Tribunal to decline its jurisdiction wrongfully, and, therefore, the Award should be annulled under the grounds provided in Article 52(1)(b) and (e).\n\n132.\n\nIt is evident from the mere reading of the allegations, and the grounds invoked in the Alternative Case that there is no identity between the incriminating defects supporting the Primary Case and the Alternative Case. Furthermore, the Applicants did not invoke, explicitly or implicitly, the ground provided in Article 52(1)(e) to support its request for annulment as to the Primary Case.\n\n133.\n\nEven though paragraphs 29 to 31 of the Application mention in a passing manner that the Tribunal's reasoning is \"minimal, and confined to four paragraphs,\"109 the Committee observes that the Applicants wilfully decided not to invoke Article 52(1)(e) in their Primary Case. Moreover, the Applicants did not contend in their Primary Case that \"minimal\" reasoning was equivalent to lack of reasoning. Neither in the Application nor in the Reply on Annulment do the Applicants refer to said ground regarding the Primary Case. In both documents, the Applicants decided to invoke a single ground with respect to the Primary Case: Article 52(1)(b). Consequently, the Committee cannot reclassify the alleged defect of the Award under a ground that was not invoked by the Applicants in the Application, either by invoking the corresponding provision of the ICSID Convention or by describing the corresponding defect in the Award, because it would be exceeding its mandate under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 29.\n\n134.\n\nUnder Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules, it is an applicant's duty to invoke one or more of the grounds provided for in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, and to state those grounds in detail in the annulment application. The Committee cannot arrogate a burden that lies on the Applicants.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, the Committee is not convinced by the Applicants' contention that the Alternative Case should be admitted because it was presented as a response to Sri Lanka's reading of the Award after the Counter-Memorial on Annulment. First, the Applicants do not explain why they could not have pleaded the Alternative Case absent Sri Lanka's Counter-Memorial on Annulment. Second, the Application itself indicates that the Applicants knew of other grounds for annulment potentially applicable to the Award that were characterized as contingent on Sri Lanka's position and consciously decided to invoke only one ground. Third, if the Committee accepted the Applicants' position, an applicant could modify the grounds for annulment *ad infinitum* depending on the other party's response.\n\n136.\n\nIn sum, the Committee considers that no legal basis exists, given the facts of this case, for allowing amendment of the original Annulment Application; the Alternative Case is not encompassed in the Primary Case, and it does not develop the arguments presented in the Application but presents new defects and grounds for annulment. Therefore, the Committee finds that the Applicants waived their right to request annulment based on other defects or on other grounds not claimed in the Application.\n\n137.\n\nFor efficiency, the Committee further concludes that whether the Applicants are time barred from presenting the Alternative Case is irrelevant because it already found that the Applicants waived their right to raise new defects and grounds for annulment not pleaded in the Application. Thus, the Committee need not address the time bar matter.\n\n138.\n\nBased on the abovesaid considerations, the Committee decides that the Alternative Case is not admissible. Therefore, it will only analyse the Primary Case presented by the Applicants to decide on the annulment of the Award.\n\n**C. The Primary Case**\n-----------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Parties' submissions concerning the Applicants' Primary Case raise two issues: whether the Tribunal's finding that the Montrose Share does not qualify as a protected investment constituted a finding of fact or of law, and whether the alleged finding qualifies as a \"manifest excess of power\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b). In light of the Parties' contentions, the Committee will analyse (1) the scope of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and (2) whether the alleged defects of the Award raised in the Primary Case constitute a manifest excess of power.\n\n**(1) Article 52(1)(b): Manifest excess of power**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Parties agree that for Article 52(1)(b) to be applied, a tribunal's error must be \"manifest\".110 They also agree that Article 52(1)(b) applies to a tribunal's decision to decline a jurisdiction that it possessed. Yet, they differ on what \"manifest\" means.\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 28; Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 9.\n\n141.\n\nOn the one hand, the Applicants advance that the \"error must be obvious by on the face of the award\";111 however, a degree of inquiry and analysis may be required if the reasoning of the award is complex. For the Applicants, the excess need not \"leap out of the page on a first reading of the award.\"112\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 28; Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 9.\n\nSee Reply on Annulment, 21 August 2020, \u00b6 20, where the Applicants refer to *EDF International SA, SAUR International SA & Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas SA v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/23 (Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2016) \u00b6 193 (**ALA-11**).\n\n142.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent claims that an *ad hoc* annulment committee is not a court of appeal; it is not within its powers to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the conclusions of the Tribunal.113 The Committee may only assess whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. For the Respondent, manifest means \"obvious, evident, clear, and plain and therefore does not require elaborate analysis.\" The Respondent relies on the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* to contend that the relevant test is \"whether the excess of power can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.\"114\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, 25 June 2020, \u00b6 17.\n\nSee Rejoinder on Annulment, 16 September 2020, \u00b6 101, referring to *Azurix v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Annulment of 1 September 2009 (**RL-6**), \u00b6\u00b6 67-69.\n\n143.\n\nFirst, the Committee notes that annulment under the ICSID Convention is not a remedy against an incorrect decision. It is a remedy of an exceptional and limited nature that constitutes a safeguard against \"violation of the fundamental principles of law governing the Tribunal's proceedings.\"115 As stated in the annulment decision in *TECO v. Guatemala,* \"an *ad hoc* Committee's mandate is strictly circumscribed by the five grounds for annulment, listed within the ICSID Convention and an *ad hoc* Committee may not, under the guise of applying them, reverse an Award on the merits.\"116 In this sense, the Committee shall not assess whether the Tribunal committed errors interpreting the applicable law or assessing the relevant facts or evidence presented by the Parties.117 The Committee must determine whether the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of power.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, 5 May 2016, \u00b6 71.\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/23, Decision on Annulment, 5 April 2016, \u00b6 73.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, 5 May 2016, \u00b6 90.\n\n144.\n\nThe excess of power must be manifest and not arguable, as *ad hoc* committees have recognized in *Soufraki v. UAE*, *Total v. Argentina*, and *Azurix v. Argentina*.118 To be manifest, the excess of powers must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations. This, however, does not mean that the Committee cannot delve into the reasoning of the Tribunal when the case is complex in order to determine whether there has been a manifest excess of powers. Accordingly, the Award must be analysed as a whole and not in parts.\n\n*Soufraki v United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007(**RL-1**), \u00b6 24; *Total S.A. v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Annulment of 1 February 2016 (**RL-5**), \u00b6 243; *Azurix v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Annulment of 1 September 2009 (**RL-6**), \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, the Committee notes that \"a Tribunal's failure to apply the proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that erroneous application of the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest.\"119 Accordingly, if the application of the law is susceptible to more than one interpretation, then there is no manifest excess of powers.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, 5 May 2016, \u00b6 90.\n\n**(2) Whether the alleged defects in the Award constitute a manifest excess of power**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Applicants claim that the \"conclusion reached by the Tribunal over its supposed lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Montrose Share was manifestly wrong in law.\"120 The Applicants characterize this conclusion as a principle of law created by the Tribunal that does not exist in international investment law, is not provided in the ICSID Convention, and is contrary to the text of the BIT.121\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6 35.\n\nApplication for Annulment, 1 May 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36, 39.\n\n147.\n\nThe Committee, however, is not convinced by the Applicants' reading of the Award. The conclusion reached by the Tribunal as regards its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is not a general or abstract finding of law that \"a share in a company can only be considered an investment if that company itself owns an investment.\" An integral reading of the Award shows that the Tribunal is not establishing a general principle of law; it is deciding on the facts according to the evidence in the record, as it is explained below.\n\n148.\n\nFirst, the wording in paragraph 292 of the Award is clear in stating that the Tribunal's decision is that \"the Montrose Share can qualify as a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT only if Montrose [Sri Lanka] itself has a protected investment in the planned Hotel Project on the Montrose Land.\"122 The Tribunal did not generally refer to \"a share\" or to \"a company\" in the abstract or as a general principle of law, it specifically referred to the Montrose Share and to Montrose Sri Lanka in a factual, not legal, analysis. Furthermore, the Committee observes that in paragraph 292, the Tribunal set the factual context of its decision and, in the following paragraphs, fleshed out the reasons supporting its conclusion, as it is made clear in the last line of the paragraph with the words \"which is addressed below.\"\n\nAward, \u00b6292.\n\n149.\n\nSecond, after paragraph 292, the Tribunal develops the following analysis:\n\n\u2022 In paragraphs 293 and 294 of the Award, the Tribunal upheld the application of the Salini Test, concluding that \"there are now many decisions that have considered that \"investment\" has an inherent meaning [under the ICSID Convention].\"123 The Tribunal noted that the \"inherent meaning\" requires at least three elements: a contribution by the investor, a certain duration, and economic risk. The Tribunal further referred to the decision in *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka v. Hellenic Republic* to conclude that the economic risk must be an investment risk (an \"operational risk\"), not a commercial risk. Then, the Tribunal analysed the Claimants' alleged investment in the Montrose Land against the abovesaid criteria.\n\n\u2022 In paragraphs 295 and 296, the Tribunal referred to the Parties' arguments on whether or not the Montrose Land constituted or not a protected investment.\n\n\u2022 In paragraph 297, the Tribunal stated that the criteria of contribution and operational risk of the Salini Test were not met, and therefore the Montrose Land was not a protected investment. Between paragraphs 298 to 302, the Tribunal elaborated on the reasons for reaching this conclusion.\n\n\u2022 In paragraph 298, the Tribunal concluded that there is no evidence in the record that Montrose Sri Lanka contributed for purchasing the Montrose Land or the Hotel Development.\n\n\u2022 In paragraphs 299 and 300, the Tribunal recounted the evidence presented by Mr Eyre to demonstrate his alleged contribution to the Montrose Land and concluded that \"[it] cannot ignore the patent lack of credible evidence documenting the sale and transfer terms for the Montrose Land.\"124 Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that \"[it] cannot find on a balance of the probabilities, that Mr Eyre \u2013through Montrose [Sri Lanka] or Montrose Global or any other Montrose Group entity\u2013contributed funds towards the purchase of the Montrose Land or, in any event, that he (or Montrose Group companies) contributed more than US$ 1 million. Even if he did contribute the US$ 1 million referenced in the Electro Resorts receipt, it can only be seen, for purposes of this Preliminary Jurisdictional Objection, to have been for the bare land and hence contributed without investment risk.\"125\n\n\u2022 In paragraphs 301 and 302, the Tribunal addressed the Claimants' argument regarding the theory of the \"unity of investment\" and rejected it. The Tribunal assessed the evidence in the record and considered \"on a balance of the probabilities, that the Hotel Project was anywhere near a certainty before the dredging and compulsory State acquisition of the Montrose Land,\" and that Mr Eyre did not actually execute contractual commitments with architects, hotel management firms or financiers. Therefore, the Hotel Project \"remained at best aspirational at the time of the compulsory State acquisition in 2010.\" The Tribunal went further on to conclude that \"Mr Eyre's contributions rose only to the pre-investment level and he did not face the operational risk necessary for the Hotel Project to qualify as a protected investment for purposes of Article 1 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"126\n\n\u2022 Finally, in paragraph 303, the Tribunal decided that it had no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because the Montrose Land \u2013whether as bare land or as the base for the planned Hotel Project\u2013 was not a protected investment.\n\nAward, \u00b6293.\n\nAward, \u00b6 300.\n\nAward, \u00b6 300.\n\nAward, \u00b6 302.\n\n150.\n\nFor the Committee the abovementioned paragraphs show that the Tribunal analysed the structure of the transaction for the purchase of the Montrose Land, assessed the facts and the evidence in the record, and concluded, as a finding of fact, that the Montrose Land did not comply with the Salini Test accepted by the Tribunal in paragraphs 293 and 294 of the Award.\n\n151.\n\nIn sum, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal's finding does not purport to create a new principle of law. It is an application of the facts to the inherent meaning of investment defined by the Tribunal in paragraphs 293 and 294 of the Award.\n\n152.\n\nConsequently, given that the Applicants' Primary Case is based on a reading of the Award that is incorrect, as rightly submitted by Respondent, in the Committee's opinion, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by deciding, as a matter of law, that the Montrose Share did not qualify as an investment because the Montrose Land was not an investment itself and therefore Montrose Sri Lanka did not hold a qualifying investment. As extensively addressed above, the Tribunal's decision is based on a factual analysis on whether the Applicants' alleged investments met the Salini Test accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n153.\n\nAs a final note, the Committee notes that it may or may not agree with the drafting of the Award and the form in which the conclusions are developed and expressed, or with the elements constituting the Salini Test, or on how the Tribunal applied the facts to the law as to the alleged inherent meaning of the term \"investment\". Yet, it is not the task of the Committee to redraft the Award or to determine whether the Salini Test was applicable or not. The Salini Test has been widely debated in investment law and was debated in the case at hand, and the Tribunal concluded that it applied and analysed the facts in the light of this conclusion. The Committee cannot second-guess the Tribunal's analysis of the facts or the evidence. The fact that another position contrasting the Tribunal's conclusions is arguable does not reach the threshold of \"manifest excess of power\", as provided in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n154.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee concludes that there is no ground, as pleaded by the Applicants, to annul the Award.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n155.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention \u2013read in conjunction with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 53\u2013 the Committee shall assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\n\n156.\n\nThe Committee observes that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention gives wide discretion to the Committee to determine how to allocate the costs of the proceedings. The Committee will first fix the costs of the annulment proceedings and then allocate the costs and other reimbursable expenses between the Parties.\n\n157.\n\nThe Applicants advance that the total costs of legal representation and assistance in connection with the annulment proceedings amount to \u00a3164,141.80. The Respondent claims that the total costs incurred by it in the annulment proceedings amount to \u00a3298,282.44. The Parties included in their statements of costs both the Annulment Application and the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n158.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):127\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Committee's fees and expenses |\n| Prof. Eduardo Zuleta | 58,500.00 |\n| Dr. Nudrat E. Piracha | 34,687.50 |\n| Prof. Giorgio Sacerdoti | 33,000.00 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 42,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 10,558.24 |\n| **Total** | **178,745.74** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n159.\n\nThe Committee will proceed to allocate the costs and other reimbursable expenses of the arbitration taking into account the success of the claims and defences of the Parties, as well as their procedural conduct, the reasonability and proportionality of the costs of legal representation and other circumstances of the case.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent prevailed in all its defences submitted before this Committee, including the defense related to the late submission of the Alternative Case. However, the Committee devoted a significant amount of time in deciding the stay of enforcement, in which Applicants prevailed. The Committee further notes that the Applicants raised complex issues that demanded the Committee's careful analysis, in particular because the Award presented some challenging issues to follow the Tribunal's rationale.\n\n161.\n\nThe Committee notes, in addition, that there is a significant disproportion between the fees for legal representation of the Applicants and the Respondent.\n\n162.\n\nIn sum, in reaching its decision, the Committee has considered the circumstances of the case, including the disparity between the costs claimed by the Parties, the outcome of the Stay Application in favour of the Applicants, the inadmissibility of the Applicants' Alternative Case, raised after the submission of Respondent's response, and the outcome of the Application in favour of the Respondent. The Committee has also considered that the Applicants' Primary Case was not manifestly frivolous and/or unmeritorious or dilatory, and that the Applicants presented genuine issues which could legitimately be brought before an annulment committee.\n\n163.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee concludes that the Applicants shall bear all the expenses incurred by ICSID and the members of Committee in connection with this annulment proceeding. In addition, the Applicants shall bear \u00a340,000 of the fees for legal representation of the Respondent and shall bear their own legal costs.\n\n**VII. DECISION OF THE COMMITTEE**\n----------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nBased on foregoing, the Committee decides:\n\n(a) The Application for Annulment submitted by the Applicants is dismissed in its entirety.\n\n(b) The Applicants shall bear all fees and expenses incurred by ICSID in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee.\n\n(c) The Applicants shall bear \u00a340,000 of Respondent's legal costs and shall bear their own legal costs in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(d) Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3), the stay of enforcement of the Award ordered by the Committee on 16 July 2020 is terminated."}]}
