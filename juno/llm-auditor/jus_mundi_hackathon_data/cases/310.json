The Claimants\u2019 investment structure is attached as Annex I to the present Decision.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Arab Republic of Egypt **(\"Egypt\"** or the **\"Respondent\").**\n\n**B.** Background of the dispute\n--------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nA dispute has arisen between the Claimants and the Respondent in respect of which the Claimants filed a request for arbitration (the **\"Request\")** on 2 May 2012 pursuant to:\n\n(i) Article VII of the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (the **\"US Treaty\"** or the **\"Egypt-US BIT\")2;**\n\n(ii) Article 9 of the Agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the **\"Germany Treaty\")3** (together, the **\"Treaties\");** and\n\n(iii) Article 36 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\nC-7. The US Treaty was executed in two languages - English and Arabic both texts being equally authentic. See Request, para. 2.\n\nC-8. The Germany Treaty was executed in three languages - German, Arabic, and English - all texts being equally authentic with the English text prevailing in case of divergent interpretation. See Request, para. 2.\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute relates to the Claimants\u2019 investment in EMG. EMG was formed on 19 April 2000 for the dual purposes of purchasing natural gas from Egypt and exporting it to Israel as well as building and operating a pipeline that runs from A1 Arish in Egypt to Ashkelon in Israel (the **\"A1 Arish-Ashkelon pipeline\"** or **\"EMG Pipeline\").** For these purposes, EMG signed on 13 June 2005 a General Sale and Purchase Agreement (the **\"Source GSPA\")** with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation **(\"EGPC\")** and Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company **(\"EGAS\").**\n\n6.\n\nEMG proceeded to sign subsequent agreements, among them, On-Sale Agreements with various customers in Israel, including the State-owned Israel Electric Corporation **(\"IEC\").** EMG completed the construction of the pipeline in December 2007 and deliveries commenced in January 2008.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants contend that before the delivery of commercial quantities of natural gas began, Egypt forced renegotiations of the GSPA, revoked EMG\u2019s tax-exempt status, failed to ensure delivery of the contracted quantities, restricted EMG\u2019s access to funds, and purported to terminate the GSPA.\n\n8.\n\nOn the basis of these acts and omissions, the Claimants allege that Egypt breached a number of protections afforded to the Claimants under the US-Egypt BIT and the Germany-Egypt BIT.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants have quantified their claims as follows4:\n\nSummary of aggregate losses to the Claimants including interest and value leakage (US$ million) - Impact of the First Amendment assessed as at Date of the First Amendment\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Claimants** | **Impact of** **Tax Exemption Revocation** | **Impact of Tax Exemption Revocation (beyond** | **Impact of the First Amendment** | **Impact of the Delivery Failures** | **Total losses** |\n| EGI Fund | 37.9 | 8.0 | 87.6 | 76.2 | 209.7 |\n| EGI Series | 0.0 | 0.0 | 95.6 | 83.2 | 178.7 |\n| BSS | 6.3 | 1.3 | 15.9 | 13.9 | 37.5 |\n| David Fischer | 9.5 | 2.0 | 23.9 | 20.7 | 56.1 |\n| Ampal | 95.4 | 20.2 | 240.5 | 208.3 | 564.4 |\n| **Total** | **149.1** | **31.6** | **375.9** | **326.1** | **882.6** |\n\nSee Letter from FTI Consulting dated 11 August 2014 (\"FTI Letter\"), Appendix 4 (revised).\n\n**C.** Parallel Proceedings\n---------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn addition to the present proceeding, four other related arbitrations have been launched:\n\n(i) EMG is engaged in three parallel contractual arbitrations involving EGPC, EGAS, and EMG\u2019s main downstream customer, IEC. EMG initiated an ICC arbitration (seated in Geneva) against IEC to obtain declaratory relief in relation to the dispute that had arisen between them under their On-Sale Agreement as a result of EGPC/EGAS\u2019s supply failures. To ensure that liability for the resulting harm was properly allocated to EGPC/EGAS, EMG then launched another ICC arbitration5 (again seated in Geneva) against both IEC and EGPC/EGAS pursuant to the Source GSPA and the Tripartite Agreement.6 EGPC/EGAS immediately contested the jurisdiction of the ICC tribunal, and initiated arbitration against EMG at CRCICA in Cairo, which it contends is the only proper contractual forum.7 There are thus three inter-related commercial arbitrations.8\n\n(ii) There is also a parallel investment treaty arbitration against Egypt, initiated under the UNCITRAL Rules and Egypt\u2019s investment treaty with Poland.9 In that proceeding, the claimants are Polish-Israeli national Yosef Maiman and three companies of the Merhav group of companies that he allegedly controls, including Ampal\u2019s subsidiary, Merhav Ampal Group Ltd.10\n\nICC Case 18215/GZ/MHM.\n\nFor purposes of this Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal will refrain from defining terms which are not pertinent to the present Decision. Those terms will be defined in the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the merits.\n\n*Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company v. East Mediterranean Gas S.A.E.

EMG\")*, CRCICA Case 829/2012.\n\nMemorial, para. 323.\n\nPCA Case 2012/26.\n\nMemorial, para. 324.\n\n11.\n\nThe remedies sought in each of these arbitrations is provided at Annex II of the present Decision.\n\n12.\n\nAs to the status of the above-mentioned arbitrations, the Tribunal notes the following.\n\n(i) In respect of the first ICC arbitration in which EMG seeks declaratory relief against IEC, the parties in the present arbitration indicated at the evidentiary hearing that that arbitration had been suspended by EMG and IEC and that EMG and IEC have now brought coordinated claims against EGAS in the second ICC arbitration.11\n\n(ii) The tribunal in the second ICC arbitration issued its Final Award on 4 December 2015. In respect of jurisdictional matters, the ICC tribunal declared (i) that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate EMG\u2019s GSPA Claims, (ii) that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate EMG\u2019s Tripartite Agreement Claims and (iii) that EMG\u2019s Tripartite Agreement Claims were admissible.\n\n(iii) In respect of the CRCICA arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the Award on Jurisdiction was issued on 11 November 201312 and that the hearing on the merits occurred on 15-26 June 2015. In its Award on Jurisdiction, the CRCICA tribunal declared it had jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n(iv) In respect of the Maiman arbitration, by letter of 18 November 2015, the Maiman tribunal communicated to the parties in that arbitration the following: \"the Tribunal has now decided that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae.* The Tribunal will provide the reasons for this decision subsequently, in its award. Consequently, the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed in respect of these issues in accordance with Article 31(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\"\n\nTr. Day 9, 73:20-74:3.

They aver, in this connection:\n\n(i) while EMG proposed to consolidate all three commercial arbitration proceedings, under any rules and in any arbitral seat outside Egypt and IEC consented to this proposal, EGPC/EGAS declined;13\n\n(ii) while the claimants in the UNCITRAL BIT proceeding sought to appoint Professor Reisman as co-arbitrator, whom EMG had already selected to serve on the CRCICA tribunal, with a view for a commonality between the tribunals, Egypt challenged Professor Reisman on that very basis;14 and\n\n(iii) while the Claimants and other EMG shareholders offered to consolidate the two treaty arbitrations on 10 May 2013 before this Tribunal because the ICSID Claimants were unwilling to forego the protection of the ICSID Convention15, Egypt insisted that consolidation could occur only before the UNCITRAL tribunal.16 At the hearing, Egypt confirmed that this position was based on no reason other than \"just testing\" to see if the Claimants would agree.17 The Claimants remain unwilling to forego the protections of the ICSID Convention.18\n\n(iv) It thus became clear, the Claimants aver, that consolidation, whether formal or informal, was not possible.19\n\nMemorial, paras. 325-326.

Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 6.\n\n15.\n\nThe relevance of these parallel proceedings in respect of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections is discussed below.\n\n**D.** Scope of the Present Decision\n------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, by Procedural Order No. 2 of 29 April 2013, it decided to join all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to the merits, thereby denying the Respondent\u2019s request for a bifurcation of the proceedings.21 The proceedings therefore continued on this basis and the Tribunal received written submissions of the parties on jurisdiction, merits and quantum and heard the parties\u2019 oral submissions on those issues during the evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe Tribunal also decided in Procedural Order No. 2 to deny the Respondent\u2019s request for a stay of the arbitration pending the outcome of the State-to-State consultation procedure in relation to Egypt\u2019s denial of the Treaty\u2019s benefits to Ampal.\n\n17.\n\nIn view of the complexity of the case and the real risk of contradictions between the four parallel arbitrations, the Tribunal has decided to issue now a decision on jurisdiction only. The present decision will be followed by an award on the merits and, if necessary, on quantum. The Tribunal considers that it is in its power to proceed in this way pursuant to Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.22\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41 (2) provides the following :\n\n*The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.*\n\n18.\n\nAccordingly, the scope of the present decision is limited to the Tribunal\u2019s decisions in respect of the Respondent\u2019s objections to its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 4 May 2012, ICSID received the Claimants\u2019 request for arbitration dated 2 May 2012 against Egypt (the **\"Request\").**\n\n20.\n\nOn 23 May 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. In the Notice of Registration of same date, the Secretary-General invited the parties to proceed to constitute a Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n21.\n\nOn 24 July 2012, the Respondent informed the Centre that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the constitution of the Tribunal and requested that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The next day, ICSID informed the Claimants, pursuant to Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"****),** that the Tribunal would be constituted pursuant to the procedure foreseen at Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n22.\n\nOn 21 August 2012, the Claimants appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a national of Chile, as arbitrator and the Respondent appointed Professor Campbell McLachlan QC, a national of New Zealand, as arbitrator.\n\n23.\n\nOn 22 August 2012, the parties agreed, pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, that the party-appointed arbitrators would appoint the presiding arbitrator.\n\n24.\n\nOn 4 September 2012, ICSID informed the parties that Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a and Professor McLachlan had both accepted their appointments.\n\n25.\n\nOn 6 September 2012, the Claimants disclosed that Freshfields would be named as counsel of record for Chile in a case before the International Court of Justice where Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a was appointed Judge Ad-Hoc upon nomination of the government of Chile. The Claimants indicated that the disclosure was made merely for transparency purposes. The Respondent did not react to this disclosure.\n\n26.\n\nOn 19 September 2012, the Centre informed the parties that the party-appointed arbitrators had decided to appoint the Honorable L. Yves Fortier CC, OQ, QC, a national of Canada, as President of the Tribunal. By the same letter, ICSID informed the parties of Mr. Fortier\u2019s disclosure in relation to his appointment by the claimant as arbitrator in the case of *National Gas S.A.E.* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17). By letters of 20 September 2013, both parties confirmed that they had no objection to the appointment of Mr. Fortier as President of the Tribunal in this case.\n\n27.\n\nOn 15 October 2012, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Natali Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. The parties were later informed that Ms. A\u00efssatou Diop, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Ms. Sequeira as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n28.\n\nOn 27 October 2013, the Respondent addressed a letter to Mr. Fortier in response to his statement of acceptance to serve as President of the Tribunal. The Respondent raised a concern relating to a parallel proceeding brought before the ICC against Egypt by EMG, the company in which the Claimants in the present proceeding are investors. The concern was that the claimant in the ICC proceeding was represented by the London office of Norton Rose, a law firm which had been merged with Ogilvy Renault LLP where Mr. Fortier used to be a partner. The Respondent also noted that Mr. Fortier and Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a were both members of the same set of chambers in London. The Respondent invited Mr. Fortier to provide any comments in relation to these concerns.\n\n29.\n\nOn 28 October 2012, Mr. Fortier replied, stating that he had not been aware of the existence of the ICC proceeding until he received and read the Respondent\u2019s letter, and he failed to see how his membership in 20 Essex Street alongside Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a affected in any way his or Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s impartiality and independence in the present matter. No other issue was raised by either Party further to Mr. Fortier\u2019s response.\n\n30.\n\nOn 29 November 2012, the Tribunal held a first session by telephone conference with the parties. Participating in the first session were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal\n\n- The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, CC, OQ, QC, President; Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna, Arbitrator; and Professor Campbell McLachlan, QC, Arbitrator\n\nICSID Secretariat\n\n- Ms. Natali Sequeira, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Claimants\n\n- Mr. Noah D. Rubins, Dr. Ben Juratowitch, and Mr. Ben Love of the law firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; and Mr. Niv Sever of the law firm of M. Firon & Co. Advocates\n\nParticipating on behalf of the Respondent\n\n- Mr. Mohamed El Sheikh, Mr. Mahmoud El Kharashy, Mr. Mohamed Khalaf, Mr. Amr Arafa, Ms. Fatma Khalifa, Ms. Reem Hendy, Ms. Lela Kassem, Mr. Mohamed Shehata, and Mr. Abdelrahman Hassanien of ESLA; and Professor Emmanuel Gaillard, Dr. Yas Banifatemi, and Mr. Alexander Uff of the law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP\n\n31.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been validly constituted. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect as of 10 April 2006, the procedural language would be English, and the place of proceeding would be Paris, France.\n\n32.\n\nThe agreement of the parties and decisions of the Tribunal on issues raised at the first session were recorded in **Procedural Order No. 1** dated 20 December 2012. In particular, the Respondent having indicated its intention to file objections to jurisdiction and to request bifurcation, the Tribunal fixed two alternative calendars for the written phase of the proceeding. The first calendar outlined the sequence of submissions in the event the Tribunal decided to join jurisdiction to the merits (\"scenario 1\"). The second calendar provided for a sequence of submissions in case the proceeding were bifurcated (\"scenario 2\").\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 January 2013, the Respondent filed a request to amend the procedural calendar. The Tribunal denied the Respondent\u2019s request on 22 January 2013 after having given the Claimants an opportunity to comment on the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n34.\n\nOn 1 March 2013, the Claimants filed their Memorial pursuant to paragraph 13.1 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n35.\n\nOn 1 April 2013, the Respondent filed a request for bifurcation of its jurisdictional objections and for the suspension of the proceeding pending the outcome of the State-to-State consultation procedure in relation to Egypt\u2019s denial of the benefits of the Egypt-US BIT to Claimant Ampal. On 15 April 2013, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent\u2019s request. On 29 April 2013, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2,** whereby it decided to join all of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections to the merits; reject the Respondent\u2019s request for a stay of the proceeding; and continue the proceeding in accordance with the unified calendar (scenario 1) set out in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n36.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, the Respondent requested an amendment to the procedural calendar in view of the political unrest in Egypt. On 17 May 2013, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request. Following an additional round of comments from the parties, the Tribunal decided to grant the Respondent\u2019s request in part as recorded in **Procedural Order No. 3** issued on 11 June 2013.\n\n37.\n\nOn 10 May 2013, the Claimants made a proposal to the Respondent to consolidate the present case and the UNCITRAL case of *Yosef Maiman and others* v. *The Arab Republic of Egypt* (PCA Case No. 2012/26) before this ICSID Tribunal.\n\n38.\n\nOn 14 May 2013, the Respondent replied with a set of conditions under which it would agree to consolidation. The conditions included the constitution of a new tribunal and the parties\u2019 agreement on the application of a new set of procedural rules. The parties exchanged further correspondence on the procedural implementation of a consolidation but failed to reach a mutually agreed solution.\n\n39.\n\nOn 16 July 2013, the Respondent requested a suspension of the procedural calendar in view of escalated political unrest in Egypt. On 22 July 2013, the Claimants filed a response to the Respondent\u2019s request, and on 23 July 2013, the Respondent filed a reply to the Claimants\u2019 response. On 25 July 2013, the Tribunal issued its decision, denying the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n40.\n\nOn 16 August 2013, the Respondent filed a renewed request for the suspension of the procedural calendar. Following two rounds of comments from the parties on the Respondent\u2019s request, the Tribunal decided on 22 August 2013 to grant the Respondent\u2019s Renewed Request and amend the procedural calendar.\n\n41.\n\nIn accordance with the amended procedural calendar, the Respondent filed its CounterMemorial (the \"Counter-Memorial\") on 28 September 2013.\n\n42.\n\nOn 9 December 2013, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of the parties\u2019 agreement to further amend the procedural calendar. On 2 January 2014, the Respondent confirmed the parties\u2019 agreement which the Tribunal endorsed the same day.\n\n43.\n\nThe parties submitted their document production requests to the Tribunal on 19 December 2013. The Tribunal\u2019s decisions in respect of the document production requests are recorded in **Procedural Order No. 4** dated 9 January 2014.\n\n44.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 4, the Claimants filed their privilege log and submitted a draft confidentiality agreement to the Respondent on 31 January 2014. The Respondent responded the same day, indicating that, thus far, it had not identified documents over which it wished to assert privilege. The Respondent also submitted its own draft confidentiality agreement.\n\n45.\n\nOn 4 February 2014, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to issue an Order on confidentiality. On 5 February 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reject the Claimants\u2019 proposed confidentiality agreement and direct the parties to conclude a confidentiality agreement in the terms proposed by the Respondent. On 12 February 2014, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n46.\n\nOn 5 March 2014, Ms. Annie Lesp\u00e9rance was appointed as Assistant to the Tribunal with the agreement of the parties.\n\n47.\n\nThe parties made additional submissions on redaction, privilege and confidentiality in February and March 2014. The Tribunal issued its decision on confidentiality, redaction, and privilege on 20 March 2014.\n\n48.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the parties\u2019 agreement to further amend the procedural calendar. On 25 March 2014, the Claimants confirmed the parties\u2019 agreement which the Tribunal endorsed.\n\n49.\n\nOn 31 March 2014, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, on the basis of Egyptian law, it was impossible for the Respondent to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s decision of March 20, 2014, directing it to submit a log of documents covered by defence secrecy or whose disclosure would be prejudicial to Egyptian national security. On 4 April 2014, the Claimants submitted observations on the Respondent\u2019s letter, requesting the Tribunal to draw an appropriate adverse inference as contemplated in Procedural Order No. 4. On 7 April 2014, the Tribunal informed the parties that, at the appropriate time, it may decide to take the Respondent\u2019s refusal to produce in camera a privilege log into account in its evaluation of the respective factual allegations and evidence including a possible inference against the Respondent.\n\n50.\n\nPursuant to the amended procedural calendar, the Claimants filed their Reply (the \"Reply\") on 14 April 2014.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 17 July 2014 after having been granted a two-week extension.\n\n52.\n\nOn 29 August 2014, the Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to file additional documents in the record. On 3 September 2014, the Respondent opposed the Claimants\u2019 request. Further rounds of comments ensued in September 2014.\n\n53.\n\nOn 26 September 2014, the Claimants submitted a further request seeking leave to file a limited number of additional factual exhibits and legal authorities to which they wished to refer at the evidentiary hearing. On 1 October 2014, the Respondent addressed the Claimants\u2019 further request.\n\n54.\n\nOn 1 October 2014, the President of the Tribunal held, on behalf of the Tribunal, a prehearing organizational meeting with the parties by telephone conference. The minutes of the meeting were circulated to the parties on 3 October 2014.\n\n55.\n\nOn 7 October 2014, the Tribunal granted for the most part the Claimants\u2019 requests of 29 August and 26 September 2014.\n\n56.\n\nOn 15 October 2014, the Respondent requested leave to introduce into the record documents from the final hearing in the Maiman arbitration, documents responsive to the Claimants\u2019 newly admitted documents, and a limited number of additional documents. On 16 October, the Claimants sought leave to introduce into the record a limited number of further factual exhibits and legal authorities. On 17 October, the Claimants stated that they had no objection to the Respondent submitting into the record the documents indicated in its request of 15 October, subject to the principle of equality of arms, i.e. that the Respondent accept the admission into the record of the unadmitted documents that the Claimants sought to introduce by their requests of 29 August and 26 September. By letter of 17 October 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to deny the Claimants\u2019 request of 16 October. By the same letter, the Respondent characterized as inappropriate the Claimants\u2019 proposal contained in their letter of 17 October.\n\n57.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request of 15 October, noting that the request was unopposed by the Claimants. The Tribunal also granted the Claimants\u2019 request of 16 October with respect to the legal authorities but denied it as to the factual exhibits.\n\n58.\n\nOn 22 October 2014, the Respondent sought leave to introduce five newly published documents into the record. On 24 October 2014, the Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n59.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place from 27 October to 6 November 2014 at the World Bank European Headquarters in Paris for the first week and, further to an agreement of the parties, as approved by the Tribunal, at the Paris office of Shearman & Sterling for the second week.

Freeny, Mr. Benjamin F. Schrader, Major General (ret.) Giora Eiland, Mr. Daniel Muthmann, Dr. Boaz Moselle, and Mr. James Nicholson.\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent\n\n- Expert witnesses: Professor Ahmed Belal, Lord Leonard Hoffmann, Major General (ret.) Warren Whiting, Mr. Nicolas Pelham, Professor Kenneth J. Vandevelde, Mr. John Wood-Collins, and Mr. Tim Giles.\n\n61.\n\nOn 19 November 2014, the Tribunal wrote to the parties with respect to a translation issue which arose during the evidentiary hearing between the Claimants\u2019 and the Respondent\u2019s respective certified translations of the minutes of the EGPC\u2019s board meeting of 24 April 2012 (see C-635 and R-872). The Tribunal informed the parties that, pursuant to the agreement they had reached at the hearing, the Tribunal would retain and instruct, through the Centre, its own translator.\n\n62.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Tribunal shared with the parties the authoritative translation of the disputed Arabic word *\"Aqar\",* provided by a World Bank certified translator, Mr. Mahmoud Ibrahim.\n\n63.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the parties submitted simultaneously their comments in respect of the authoritative translation.\n\n64.\n\nThe parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 14 February 2015.\n\n65.\n\nOn 12 February 2015, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to produce a document that they had filed in the CRCICA arbitration containing information that \"is essential to th[is] Tribunal\u2019s determination.\" On 13 February 2015, the Claimants responded that the document requested had not been sufficiently identified by the Respondent and asked for additional time to address the Respondent\u2019s request. Following comments from the parties, the Tribunal decided on 2 March 2015 to grant the Respondent\u2019s application, allowing the document in question, identified as ECOM Memo # 62, to be part of the record. On 5 March 2015, the Respondent filed the same as its own exhibit.\n\n66.\n\nOn 12 March 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal that the Respondent was advancing a new case on coercion and misrepresentation through this new exhibit and, if the Tribunal was minded to consider the Respondent\u2019s new position, then the Claimants would request an opportunity to respond and submit additional documentary and witness evidence. The Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 application on 18 March 2015. The Tribunal invited the Claimants to provide it with a summary of the new documentary and/or witness evidence they wished to submit. The Claimants did so on 25 March 2015.\n\n67.\n\nRecalling that ECOM Memo 62 (Exhibit R-964) was admitted into the record on 2 March 2015, the Tribunal decided, on 6 April 2015, that the Memo would be taken into account in the course of its continuing deliberations as necessary and in the light of the parties\u2019 submissions and arguments up to and including the parties\u2019 respective posthearing briefs. Therefore, the Tribunal decided that the Claimants\u2019 application of 12 March 2015 was moot.\n\n68.\n\nOn 27 May 27 2015, the Respondent submitted an application to the Tribunal for leave to reexamine two of the Claimants\u2019 fact witnesses, Mr. Hamdy and Mr. Sakka, and to make written and oral submissions on the impact of the alleged false evidence provided by Mr. Hamdy and the alleged forgery of a document described as \"the minutes of the meeting of EMG\u2019s Board of Directors, which was held 2 November 2009\". The Respondent annexed to its letter two documents identified as \"the Authentic Minutes\" and \"the Forged Minutes\".\n\n69.\n\nHaving considered the Claimants\u2019 comments on the Respondent\u2019s request and deliberated, the Tribunal ordered the parties on 12 June 2015 to submit, after the conclusion of the hearing before the CRCICA tribunal, an agreed transcript relevant to the Respondent\u2019s request, provided that the parties before the CRCICA Tribunal agreed.\n\n70.\n\nIn compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s order of 12 June 2015, the parties submitted on 14 September 2015 agreed excerpts of the CRCICA hearing transcript. On 5 October 2015, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 5,** admitting the excerpts into the record and inviting each party to make submissions on the impact, if any, of the two versions of EMG\u2019s November 2009 Board meeting minutes on the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n71.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, the Respondent filed a request asking the Tribunal to admit further evidence into the record of this arbitration emanating from the transcript of the CRCICA hearing. Following further rounds of comments, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 6** on 29 October 2015 denying the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n72.\n\nOn 7 December 2015, the Tribunal directed the parties to produce an agreed compendium of documents pertinent to liability in chronological order as requested by the Tribunal in its e-mail to the parties of 28 April 2015 and at the hearing in Paris on 29 October 2014.\n\n73.\n\nIn compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 5, the Respondent filed its submission on the impact of the alleged forgery on 2 November 2015. On 30 November 2015, the Claimants filed their reply. At the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Respondent confirmed on 9 December 2015 that it did not oppose the admission into the record of the documents attached to the Claimants\u2019 submission of 30 November 2015. On 15 December 2015, the Tribunal admitted the Claimants\u2019 documents into the record.23\n\nIn its application of 2 November 2015, the Respondent addressed various requests to the Tribunal. At the time of the issuance of the present Decision, the Tribunal remains seized of the Respondent\u2019s application which it will deal with in the course of its continuing deliberations.\n\n**III. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n-------------------------\n\n**A.** Claimants\u2019 Request for Relief\n------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n*(i) DISMISS all of Egypt\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims;*\n\n*(ii) DECLARE:*\n\n*a) that Egypt violated Article II(4) of the US Treaty (or Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty, applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), Article 2(2) of the Germany Treaty, and customary international law by failing to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment and impairing their investments through the adoption of unreasonable measures;*\n\n*b) that Egypt violated Article II(4) of the US Treaty (or Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty, applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), Article 2(3) of the Germany Treaty, and customary international* *law by engaging in arbitrary and discriminatory measures against the Claimants\u2019 investment because it was selling natural gas to Jews in Israel;*\n\n*c) that Egypt has violated Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty (applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), Article 7(2) of the Germany Treaty, and customary international law by failing to observe obligations it has entered into with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investments;*\n\n*d) that Egypt has violated Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty (applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), Article 4(1) of the Germany Treaty, and customary international law by failing to provide the Claimants and their investments with full protection and security; and*\n\n*e) that Egypt expropriated the Claimants\u2019 investments without payment of adequate and effective compensation, a public purpose, or due process of law in violation of Article III(1) of the US Treaty, Article 4(2) of the Germany Treaty, and customary international law.*\n\n*(iii) ORDER Egypt to pay compensation to the Claimants of no less than US$ 882.6 million and, to the extent applicable, DECLARE that the sum awarded has been calculated net of Egyptian taxes;*\n\n*(iv) ORDER Egypt to pay pre- and post-award interest at Egypt\u2019s sovereign borrowing rate (as updated), compounded annually, accruing until payment is made in full;*\n\n*(v) ORDER Egypt to indemnify the Claimants in full with respect to any Egyptian taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the extent that such compensation has been calculated net of Egyptian taxes;*\n\n*(vi) ORDER Egypt to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the Claimants\u2019 reasonable legal and expert fees, and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal; and*\n\n*(vii) AWARD such other relief to the Claimants as the Tribunal considers appropriate.24*\n\nReply, para. 637.\n\n**B.** Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief\n--------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to :\n\n*(i) Stay this proceeding pending the issuance of Awards in each of CRCICA Case No. 829/2012 and ICC Case No. 18215/GZ/MHM, dismissing the claims made by EMG or awarding damages in respect of such claims;*\n\n*(ii) Alternatively, dismiss the Claimants\u2019 claims in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction* *and/or as inadmissible;*\n\n*(iii) Alternatively, dismiss the Claimants\u2019 claims on the merits;*\n\n*(iv) In the event that the Tribunal finds that the Respondent is liable to the Claimants as a matter of principle, stay any decision on quantum pending the issuance of Awards in each of CRCICA Case No. 829/2012, ICC Case No. 18215/GZ and PCA Case No. 2012-26, dismissing the claims made by EMG or its shareholders (as applicable) or awarding damages in respect of such claims;*\n\n*(v) In any event, order the Claimants jointly and severally to pay all of the costs of this arbitration as well as the Respondent\u2019s legal costs and expenses in connection with this arbitration, including but not limited to its counsel\u2019s fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of its experts; and*\n\n*(vi) Grant the Respondent such further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate.25*\n\nRejoinder, para. 1163.\n\n**IV. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has advanced the following seven objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims: (A) objection *ratione personae* in respect of Ampal; (B) objection *ratione personae* in respect of EGI-Fund and EGI-Series; (C) objection *ratione personae* in respect of Mr. David Fischer; (D) objection *ratione materiae* in respect of the Claimants\u2019 Gas Supply Claims; (E) objection *ratione materiae* in respect of the Claimants\u2019 Tax Claims; (F) inadmissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims in view of the illegality of the GSPA; and (G) inadmissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims for abuse of the arbitral process.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider each one of these objections in turn.\n\n**A.** Ratione Personae Competence over Ampal\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks *ratione personae* competence over Ampal because (i) nationals of United States do not have a substantial interest in that company pursuant to the US Treaty, and (ii) in any event, in light of the control exercised by Mr. Maiman over Ampal, the Respondent has denied Ampal the benefits of the US Treaty pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Protocol thereto, including the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration at Article VII. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent also submitted that Ampal has failed to establish its interest in EMG.\n\n*a)*  *Substantial US Interest in Ampal*\n----------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the State Parties to the US Treaty agreed that its benefits should be extended only to \"nationals\" and \"companies of the other Party\".\n\n80.\n\nArticle I(1)(b) of the US Treaty defines \"company of a Party\" as:\n\n*a company duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or its political subdivisions in which*\n\n*(i) natural persons who are nationals of such Party, or*\n\n*(ii) such Party or its subdivision or its agencies or instrumentalities have a substantial interest.*\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent thus avers that Article I(1)(b) contains two cumulative requirements for a company to benefit from the Treaty: (i) a company must be duly incorporated in one of the Contracting States, and (ii) natural persons who are nationals of that State (or the State of incorporation itself) must \"have a substantial interest\" in the company.26\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 107.\n\n82.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that Ampal is incorporated in the US27 and that whether the substantial interest requirement is fulfilled in relation to Ampal falls to be determined by the Tribunal.28\n\nC-l.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16. Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 4. See Tr. Day 1, 99:7-9.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is undisputed between the parties that Mr. Maiman and his family, who are not nationals of the United States, own the majority of the outstanding shares in Ampal and exercise decisive control over that company29. This is supported, avers the Respondent, by Ampal\u2019s filings at the United States Security and Exchange Commission30 which confirm that Mr. Maiman owned over 60% of Ampal\u2019s shares in 2008 and in 2012. These documents further show that Mr. Maiman and his immediate family, in virtue of their substantial ownership of Ampal\u2019s voting stock, were *\"able to control [the company\u2019s] affairs and to influence the election of the members of [its] board of directors.\"31*\n\nSee Memorial, para. 106 (*\"Mr. Maiman, who is not a citizen of the United States, controls approximately 60% of the shares in Ampal...\").*\n\nSee C- 222 and C-223.\n\nSee C- 222, p. 2 and C-223, p.4. Counter-Memorial, para. 108.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent thus concludes that *\"[i]n light of Mr. Maiman\u2019s ownership of the majority of Ampal\u2019s outstanding shares, and control over the company, it is clear that U.S. citizens do not 'have a substantial interest\u2019 in Ampal, and that Ampal does not meet the ratione personae jurisdictional requirements of Article I(1)(b) of the Egypt-U.S. BIT\"32*\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 109.\n\n85.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent asserts that Ampal\u2019s business activities and debts are in Israel and that Ampal is managed by non-US nationals.33\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17. See R-404 (Ampal SEC 10-K for 2006 - while Ampal was not required to disclose the nationality of its management to the SEC, its filing indicates that the directors of the company live and work in Israel avers the Respondent) and R-391 (Ampal owed US$ 234.5 million to bondholders in Israel and US$ 115 million to Israeli banks avers the Respondent).\n\n86.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the \"principal issue\" in determining a substantial U.S. interest is \"ownership of equity\"34, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to adduce any evidence that even a single share of Ampal was owned by US nationals.35 The Claimants ask the Tribunal to infer, based on the Iran-US Claims Tribunal decision in *Flexi-Van Leasing, Inc. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran (\"Flexi-Vanf36,* that a sufficient portion of Ampal\u2019s shares not owned by Mr. Maiman is US-owned. However, argues the Respondent, the purported US ownership of Ampal\u2019s shares could not amount to a substantial interest in view of its undisputed majority ownership and control by non-US nationals. The Respondent further argues that, in any event, even if it were otherwise appropriate or had gained any broader acceptance, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal\u2019s approach in *Flexi-Van* is expressly inapplicable to companies such as Ampal, which are controlled by a single (non-US) shareholder.37\n\nTr. Day 1, 197:16-17.\n\nTr. Day 1, 202:14-25. The Claimants have only produced spread sheets of Ampal\u2019s shareholders between 2008 and 2012, which list the purported residence of those individuals. See C-128.\n\n*Flexi-Van Leasing, Inc. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* 1 Iran-U.S.C.T.R. 455, Iran Order No. 36, Order, 15 December 1982, CLA-224.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18. See *Flexi-Van* v. *Iran,* CLA-224, p. 458; Tr. Day 9, 260:23-261:2; Rejoinder para. 94.\n\n87.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that the US itself has a substantial interest in Ampal, the Respondent contends that (i) the listing of Ampal on a US stock exchange is insufficient to create jurisdiction, (ii) Mr. Maiman\u2019s decision to place Ampal in bankruptcy after initiating this arbitration cannot create jurisdiction, and (iii) Ampal\u2019s alleged debt to the US tax authorities pales in comparison to the US$ 240 million owed to its Israeli debenture holders.38\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Slide 167.\n\n*b)*  *Denial of Benefits*\n--------------------------\n\n88.\n\nEven if Ampal did meet the corporate nationality requirements of the US Treaty, the Respondent submits that it has exercised its right to deny Ampal the benefits of the Egypt-U.S. BIT pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Protocol thereto.39 Paragraph 1 of the Protocol provides:\n\n*Each Party reserves the right to deny the benefits of this Treaty to any company of either Party, or its affiliates or subsidiaries, if nationals of any third country control such company, affiliate or subsidiary; provided that, whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended for this reason, it shall promptly consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.40*\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 113.\n\nC-7.\n\n89.\n\nPursuant to Paragraph 2 of the Protocol to the Egypt-U.S. BIT, \"control\" means \"to have a substantial share of ownership rights and the ability to exercise decisive influence\".41\n\nC-7\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, as Professor Vandevelde42 explained at the evidentiary hearing, the State Parties\u2019 explicit reservation of rights to deny benefits is subject to objective conditions set out in the Protocol, namely, the requirement of third-country control and of prompt consultations, and whether those conditions have been met is fully reviewable by the Tribunal.43 This Tribunal is also empowered to determine the effect of Egypt\u2019s denial of benefits on its jurisdiction over Ampal\u2019s claims avers the Respondent.44\n\nRespondent\u2019s expert.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22. See Tr. Day 7, 235:3-236:21.\n\nTr. Day 7, 172:9-12, 176:4-8.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the requirements of Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Protocol have been met in the present case and that, consequently, the Respondent has effectively denied Ampal the benefits of the US Treaty:\n\n(i) By letter dated 27 January 2013, Egypt informed Ampal that it had exercised its right under Paragraph 1 of the Egypt-U.S. BIT to deny the benefits of that Treaty to Ampal in light of the control of that company by Mr. Maiman and his immediate family.45 Egypt separately contacted the United States to inform it of its denial of benefits to Ampah46\n\n(ii) The Claimants do not contest that the substantive requirement for a denial of benefits is present in this case, namely, that Ampal is controlled by third party nationals within the meaning of Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Protocol to the Egypt-U.S. BIT.47\n\n(iii) In response to the Respondent\u2019s notification, the United States agreed by Diplomatic Note dated 19 March 2013 to hold consultations with Egypt.48\n\n(iv) The State Parties met in Washington, D.C. on 30 September 2013 and 9 December 2013 to consult in relation to Egypt\u2019s denial of benefits to Ampah49\n\n(v) By Diplomatic Note dated 6 March 2014, the United States wrote to Egypt concluding that:\n\n*good faith consultations, and the absence of any expressed disagreement, between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt constitute a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter, in accordance with Paragraph 1 of the Supplementary Protocol to the Treaty.50*\n\n(vi) In response to the United States\u2019 communication, Egypt confirmed by Diplomatic Note dated 17 April 2014 its understanding that, given the absence of any disagreement between the two Governments in relation to its denial to Ampal of the benefits of the Treaty, the consultations had resulted in a *\"mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter\"* within the meaning of Paragraph 1 of the Protocol.51\n\nSee Letter from Embassy of Egypt in Tel Aviv (M. El-Kouny) to Ampal dated 27 January 2013, C-224.\n\nSee R-24.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 118. See Memorial, para. 106: *\"Mr. Maiman, who is not a citizen of the United States, controls approximately 60% of the shares in Ampal...\".*\n\nR-21.\n\nRejoinder, para. 112.\n\nR-888.\n\nRejoinder, para. 115. See R-891. At the hearing, Egypt completed the record with further correspondence between Egypt and the USA (see R-941-R-946).\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the effect of the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits to Ampal is to deprive Ampal of any right to invoke or rely on the US Treaty, including the right to submit disputes to ICSID arbitration.52\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 119.\n\n93.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent argues that in its consultations, it provided the United States with the full details of the circumstances having justified its denial of benefits to Ampal in the context of this proceeding. Had the US considered that the Protocol required Egypt to initiate consultations before denying benefits to Ampal, or that benefits could not be denied after Ampal had submitted claims to arbitration, such disagreement would have been raised during the consultations.53 Instead, the US confirmed by Diplomatic Note dated 6 March 2014 that Egypt had satisfied the requirements of the Protocol and that the consultations between the State Parties had resulted in a \"mutually satisfactory resolution\". The State Parties\u2019 interpretation is the most authoritative interpretation of the Treaty\u2019s text, avers the Respondent.54\n\nRejoinder, paras. 120-121.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 122.\n\n94.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that Egypt was required to consult the United States before denying benefits to Ampal,55 the Respondent contends that the plain language of the Protocol requires the parties to \"promptly\" consult. Professor Vandevelde testified at the hearing that the State Parties agreed to depart from the requirement under the original version of the Treaty that a State must \"first\" consult before exercising the right to deny benefits.56\n\nSee Tr. Day 1, 223:10-14.\n\nTr. Day 7, 177:9-178:11. The original version of the Treaty provided that: *Each Party reserves the right to deny to any of its own companies or to a company of the other Party the advantages of this Treaty, if nationals of any third country own or control such company; provided that whenever one Party believes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended to a company of the other Party for this reason, it shall*  *first consult* *with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.* See Expert Opinion of Professor Kenneth J. Vandevelde (\"Vandevelde Expert Legal Opinion\"), para. 53.\n\n95.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of paragraph 1 of the Protocol would allow a company to foreclose a State Party\u2019s right to deny benefits by simply submitting a claim to arbitration. According to the Claimants, this would undermine the object and purpose of denial of benefits provisions, which is to prevent third-country investors from gaining treaty protection in situations in which the host State did not wish to extend such benefits to them as explained in Professor Vandevelde\u2019s written and oral testimony57. In its submission as a non-disputing party in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador (\"Pac Rim v. El Salvador\"),* the United States confirmed that its *\"long-standing policy\"* to include denial of benefits provisions in its treaties is aimed at *\"safeguarding] against the potential problem of free rider\u2019 investors, i.e., third-party entities that may only as a matter of formality be entitled to the benefits of a particular agreement\"*,58 The United States further submitted that any requirement to invoke the denial of benefits provision before an investor submits its claim to arbitration *\"would place an untenable burden on* [the denying] *Party\",* because it would:\n\n*require the respondent, in effect, to monitor the ever-changing business activities of all enterprises... that attempt to make, are making, or have made investments in the territory of the respondent. This would include conducting, on a continuing basis, factual research, for all such enterprises, on their respective corporate structures and the extent of their business activities in those countries.59*\n\nVandevelde Expert Legal Opinion, para. 35.

Ecuador\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/9, Award, 2 June 2009, RLA-26.\n\n97.\n\nIn respect of the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits cannot deprive Ampal of any Treaty protection, the Respondent argues that its offer to arbitrate is subject to its right to deny benefits. As Professor Vandevelde opines in his Expert Legal Opinion, a company controlled by third-country nationals *\"never has an* *unconditional, or vested, right to treaty protection\"*,61 Accordingly, a State that invokes a denial of benefits provision after a claim has been submitted to arbitration does not withdraw consent to arbitration that was previously given, but rather exercises a right to deny benefits which was reserved within that consent. To hold otherwise would defeat the purpose of the denial of benefits provision in the Treaty opines Professor Vandevelde.62 The Respondent submits that tribunals interpreting similar provisions in US treaties have uniformly reached this conclusion63 and that the Energy Charter Treaty decisions on which the Claimants rely are inapposite since Article 17(1) of the ECT does not condition a State\u2019s consent to arbitration.64\n\nVandevelde Expert Legal Opinion, para. 121.\n\nRejoinder, para. 137.

Day 7, 187:10-22.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, in respect of the Claimants\u2019 argument that jurisdiction of an international tribunal is to be assessed at the time of that jurisdiction being invoked, the Respondent contends that this argument is irrelevant to the question of denial of benefits and has not been considered by any other tribunal in deciding that issue. While the Claimants alleged that \"ten cases\" supporting this principle could call into question the effect of Egypt\u2019s denial of benefits, these cases concern the effect on jurisdiction of extrinsic events that bear no relation to denial of benefits, and are thus irrelevant to the effect of a denial of benefits under the US BIT.65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28. See Respondent\u2019s Demonstrative Exhibit R-959.\n\n*c)*  *Ampal has failed to establish its interest in EMG*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent raised the following new objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\n*The highly convoluted and opaque structure through which Ampal holds its interest in EMG involves not only numerous related intermediary companies, the corporate and financial relationships (including intercompany debts) of which have never been established or explained, but also entirely fails to take account of intervening third party rights including loans, the terms of which are nowhere in the record of this arbitration.... All these matters potentially seriously impair the* *flow of funds up the corporate chain from EMG to Ampal, contrary to the premise of Ampal\u2019s claim.66*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Substantial US Interest in Ampal*\n----------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Ampal satisfies both criteria of Article I(1)(b) of the US Treaty.\n\n101.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that whether the substantial interest requirement is fulfilled in relation to Ampal falls to be determined by the Tribunal.67\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16. Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief para. 4. See Tr. Day 1, 99:7-9.\n\n102.\n\nIn respect of the first criterion, the Claimants argue that US nationals have a \"substantial interest\" in Ampal:\n\n(i) The fact that Mr. Maiman owns a majority of Ampal and controls the company does not preclude US nationals from having a \"substantial interest\" in the company aver the Claimants. According to the Claimants, \"substantial interest\" does not mean majority interest nor does it mean a controlling interest, otherwise it would have been stated explicitly in the Treaty.68\n\n(ii) The Claimants allege that based on a list dated 1 January 2008, the addresses of 1125 of the 1199 registered owners of voting shares are within the United States, with the US-registered owners holding 38.18% of Ampal\u2019s voting share capital.69 Similarly, in a list dated 1 January 2012, 1145 of the 1215 registered owners of voting shares have addresses within the United States, representing 41.42% of Ampal\u2019s voting share capital.70\n\n(iii) The Claimants are, however, not in a position to produce direct evidence that these US residents are in fact US nationals: nationalities of shareholders in companies publicly-listed in the United States are not recorded.71 The Claimants nevertheless argue that the Tribunal should follow the Iran-US Claims Tribunal precedent whereby the Iran-US Claims Tribunal accepted evidence from which it drew a reasonable inference regarding shareholder nationality.72 The process used by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal can be used to estimate the percentage of shares in Ampal held by US nationals assert the Claimants:\n\n- The relevant Ampal SEC filing from 2008, discloses that Ampal was 59.7% beneficially owned by a non-US national, Mr. Maiman.73\n\n- Based on US Department of the Treasury data, in 2008, 10.3% of portfolio investment in equity in US companies was foreign owned.74\n\n- It is thus reasonable to infer that, when a claim first arose, approximately 36.15% of Ampal was owned by US nationals.75\n\n- If the same calculation is undertaken for 2012, when the Request for Arbitration was filed, the percentage is 27.95%.\n\n(iv) These numbers are estimates, not precise calculations. Nonetheless, the evidence provided by the Claimants is sufficient to establish *prima facie* that US nationals have a \"substantial interest\" in Ampah76\n\nReply, para. 152.\n\nC-128(b).\n\nC-128(f).\n\nReply, para. 157.\n\nReply paras. 158-160. See *Flexi-Van* v. *Iran,* CLA-224.\n\nC-222.\n\nC-448.\n\nReply, para. 161.\n\nReply, para. 161. See C-223, C-380, and C-448.\n\n103.\n\nIn response to Egypt\u2019s argument that the *Flexi-Van* test cannot be applied to Ampal because one shareholder controls it, the Claimants contend the following:\n\n*The fact that a company is controlled by one individual is only relevant because it increases the percentage of a company\u2019s share capital in respect of which the nationality of the beneficial owner needs to be proven by direct evidence, and therefore reduces the percentage of shares for which an inference may be drawn. Here, there is direct evidence that a* *majority of the share capital of Ampal-American is beneficially owned by non-US nationals. The question for the Tribunal, unaddressed by Egypt\u2019s argument, concerns the use of indirect evidence to reach a conclusion about the ownership of the remaining shares.77*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5.\n\n104.\n\nIn respect of the second criterion, the Claimants submit that the United States has a \"substantial\" interest in Ampal. The Claimants aver that \"substantial interest\" is not only concerned with equity interests. As Professor Vandevelde explains: *\"a stock ownership test would have overlooked other forms of interest, such as debt securities, that U.S. nationals might have in the company.\"78\u2019*\n\nKenneth J. Vandevelde, *U.S. International Investment Agreements,* Oxford University Press, 2009, RLA-25, pp. 150-151,418,578-584.\n\n105.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants argue that:\n\n*a company incorporated in the United States and listed on a US stock exchange is one in which the United States has a substantial interest. The substantial interest that the United States has in such a company is highlighted by the bankruptcy proceedings pending before the US courts in connection with Ampal.... A US federal court (an organ of the United States) has appointed a trustee in bankruptcy, himself a US citizen, who now controls the company for the benefit of its creditors.*\n\n*One of those creditors is the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance,...79*\n\nReply, para. 166.\n\n*b)*  *Denial of Benefits*\n--------------------------\n\n106.\n\nIn respect of the Respondent\u2019s alternative defence, the Claimants agree with the Respondent that it falls to the Tribunal to determine whether the requirements of third-country control and of prompt consultations have been met, as well as the effect of Egypt\u2019s denial of benefits on its jurisdiction over Ampal\u2019s claims.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Egypt\u2019s attempt to deny Ampal the benefits of the US Treaty is ineffective.\n\n108.\n\nFirstly, the Claimants argue that Egypt cannot unilaterally terminate the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. They explain that on Egypt\u2019s case, and leaving aside its jurisdictional objections, the Centre was validly seized when Ampal filed its Request for Arbitration in May 2012, and had jurisdiction over the dispute for the next eight months until January 2013, when by its unilateral act, Egypt \"terminated\" the jurisdiction of the Centre and of this Tribunal.80 However, the Claimants assert that (i) it is well-established that jurisdiction is to be determined in light of the situation that exists on the date the arbitral proceedings are instituted, not by subsequent events;81 and (ii) Egypt must confront Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention which states that *\"When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\",82* Egypt is therefore prevented by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention from unilaterally withdrawing its consent by way of a purported denial of benefits after Ampal had already accepted Egypt\u2019s offer to arbitrate and so perfected the arbitration agreement aver the Claimants.83 A contrary result would retroactively eliminate a right to arbitration that had already been exercised say the Claimants.84\n\nReply, para. 171.\n\nReply, para. 173. See *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic (\"Aguas del Aconquija* v. *Argentina\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, CLA-140, paras. 61, 63.\n\nReply, para. 174.\n\nReply, para. 174.\n\nReply, para. 179.\n\n109.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants submit that Egypt cannot retroactively nullify substantive treaty protection enjoyed by Ampal at the time of Egypt\u2019s challenged measures. They assert that:\n\n*[w]hether Egypt is seeking to deny a protection already obtained or subject that protection to later cancellation, its position involves retroactivity. Either approach requires Egypt to establish that the denial of benefits provision entitles it to avoid, responsibility for internationally wrongful acts where that responsibility had already crystalized at the time of the purported denial. On either approach, Egypt deems [sic]* *Treaty breaches that did in fact occur not to have occurred.* *For the Tribunal to find such a retroactive effect, the Tribunal would need to be satisfied that the US Treaty provision concerning denial of benefits rebuts the presumption against retroactivity.85*\n\nReply, para. 185.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants assert that under cross-examination Professor Vandevelde agreed that a denial of the benefits of the US Treaty only has a prospective effect.86 Egypt accepts that a denial of the right to submit disputes to arbitration has effect from the time of the denial onwards. According to the Claimants, Egypt must therefore equally accept that the benefits of the substantive protections of the US Treaty are denied only from the point of denial onwards and that Ampal therefore was protected by the substantive protections of the Treaty when the events in dispute occurred. This is also the position that was taken in decisions based on the ECT.87\n\nTr. Day 7, 212:5-16.\n\nTr. Day 1, 97:4-17. Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7.\n\n111.\n\nThirdly, the Claimants contend that the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is to be assessed at the time of that jurisdiction being invoked. In other words, consent is only necessary to initiate an arbitration, and conduct occurring thereafter is irrelevant to jurisdiction.88 The Claimants rely on ten cases89 in this respect which confirmed that any condition that can be invoked to defeat jurisdiction must be invoked prior to the seisin to have any effect. The Claimants rely in particular on the *Right of Passage* case.90 They submit:\n\n*the Rights of Passage case concerned the effect of a condition embedded in Portugal\u2019s consent to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. By that condition, Portugal purported to \u2018reserve[] the right to exclude from the scope of* *the present declaration, at any time during its validity, any given category or categories of disputes, by notifying the Secretary-General of the United Nations and with effect from the moment of such notification. \u2019 The court held that: \u2018It is a rule of law generally accepted, as well as one acted upon in the past by the Court, that, once the Court has been validly seised of a dispute, unilateral action by the respondent State in terminating its Declaration, in whole or in part, cannot divest the Court of jurisdiction. \u2019 None of the cases relied on by Egypt took account of this rule. The alternative position advanced by Egypt - that benefits can be unilaterally denied at any time - is so obviously contrary both to this rule and to the object and purpose of the US Treaty that it could only be countenanced by this Tribunal if explicit treaty terms left it no choice.91*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 11.\n\n*Nottebohm case (Liechtenstein* v. *Guatemala), Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 18 November 1953,* IC.I Reports 1953, CLA-234, p. 123; *Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

The object and purpose of the US Treaty as a whole includes \"the pursuit of policies and practices which foster bilateral trade and investment\" in order to \"contribute substantially to the long-term benefit and welfare of the peoples of each Party,\" the \"encouragement and nondiscriminatory treatment of investments\" and the \"reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments.\" See the Preamble to the US Treaty, C-7.\n\n113.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that even if the Tribunal were to find that benefits can be denied retroactively, Egypt\u2019s denial of benefits would still be ineffective in the present case because Egypt failed to fulfil the mandatory condition of consulting with the US Government promptly after deciding that benefits to Ampal should be denied. Indeed, in the present case, Egypt only consulted with the US Government after it had decided to deny them.93\n\nReply, para. 206. According to para. 1 of the Protocol (C-7), the condition is that \"whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended for this reason, it shall consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.\"\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that, should it decide to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione personae* in respect of Ampal, this would be dispositive of Ampal\u2019s claims only.\n\n115.\n\nThere are two issues before the Tribunal: (a) whether Ampal is a protected \"company of a Party\", and (b) whether Egypt\u2019s denial of benefits is effective. A third issue which has arisen in the Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief is whether Ampal has established its interest in EMG. The Tribunal will consider each of these arguments in turn below.\n\n*a)*  *Substantial US Interest in Ampal*\n----------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nArticle I(1)(b) of the US Treaty defines \"company of a Party\" as:\n\n*A company duly incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or its political subdivisions in which*\n\n*(i) natural persons who are nationals of such Party, or*\n\n*(ii) such Party or its subdivision or its agencies or instrumentalities have a substantial interest.*\n\n117.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that Ampal is incorporated in the United States and that whether the substantial interest requirement is fulfilled in relation to Ampal is to be determined by the Tribunal.\n\n118.\n\nIt is also undisputed between the parties that Mr. Maiman and his family, who are not nationals of the United States, own the majority of the outstanding shares in Ampal and exercise control over that company.\n\n119.\n\nIt now remains for the Tribunal to decide whether the Claimants have proven to its satisfaction that nationals of the United States have a substantial interest in Ampal.\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal starts from the premise that the Treaty does not require that a substantial interest be a controlling or a majority interest.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants have submitted evidence that, as of 1 January 2008, the addresses of 1125 of the 1199 registered owners of voting shares were in the United States and the US-registered owners of shares held 38.18% of Ampal\u2019s voting share capital. As of 1 January 2012, 1145 out of the 1215 registered owners have addresses in the United States and they represent 41.42% of Ampal\u2019s voting share capital.\n\n122.\n\nWhile the Claimants have not produced direct evidence that these US residents are in fact US nationals, the Tribunal adopts the reasoning of the Iran-US tribunal in the *Flexi-Van* case and draws a reasonable inference on the basis of the evidence proffered that the percentage of shares in Ampal held by US nationals as of 1 January 2008 and 1 January 2012 amounts to a substantial interest in that company.94\n\n*Flexi-Van v. Iran,* CLA-224, pp. 2-3:\n\n*\"[I]t is neither possible nor necessary to require submission... of detailed evidence such as either passports, birth certificates or certified copies of naturalization documents for each of the thousands of individuals who collectively own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the capital stock of [the claimant],*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Any such requirement... would impose excessive burdens on the parties and the Tribunal.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Other Tribunals which have adjudicated international claims in the past... have required what they considered to be sufficient evidence and*  *from that have drawn reasonable inferences.**\u2019\u2019* (Emphasis added).\n\n123.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction over Ampal based on this ground.\n\n*b)*  *Denial of Benefits*\n--------------------------\n\n124.\n\nBy letter dated 27 January 201395, the Respondent informed Claimant Ampal that it had exercised its right to deny to it the benefits of the Egypt-US Treaty pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Protocol to the BIT.\n\n*Flexi-Van v. Iran,* C-224.\n\n125.\n\nDenial-of-benefits clauses in investment treaties are generally designed to exclude from Treaty protections nationals of third States which claim rights through so-called \"mailbox\" or \"shell\" companies that have no economic connection to the state whose nationality is invoked.\n\n126.\n\nIn recent years, there have been a number of awards and decisions which have interpreted denial-of-benefits clauses. The parties have referred the Tribunal to these awards and decisions and the Tribunal has reviewed them all very carefully.96\n\nSee, *inter alia, Pac Rim v. El Salvador,* RLA-11; *Guaracachi and Rurelec v. Bolivia,* CLA-213; *Ulysseas v. Ecuador,* RLA-32; *EMELEC* v. *Ecuador,* RLA-26; *Plama Consortium Limited* v. *Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, RLA-22, paras. 159-165; *Yukos Universal Ltd. v. Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. AA 227, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009, CLA-1, paras. 456-459; *Hulley Enterprises Ltd.* v. *Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. AA 226, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009, RLA-27, paras. 455-458; *Anatolie Stati et. al. v. The Republic of Kazakhstan,* SCC Case No. V (116/2010), Award, 19 December 2013, CLA-194, para. 717; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, RLA-159, para. 386.\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review reveals that different tribunals have reached diverging decisions as to when, how and with what effect such clauses can be invoked.\n\n128.\n\nUsing a broad brush, the Tribunal notes that there are two principal categories of decisions: those where jurisdiction was based on the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and those where the basis of jurisdiction was a clause in US bilateral investment treaties or in the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).\n\n129.\n\nFor purposes of its present decision, the Tribunal need not consider those decisions interpreting Article 17(1) of the ECT as the wording of that provision is significantly different from the wording of denial-of-benefits clauses in US BITs and CAFTA. These latter clauses have more in common with the denial-of-benefits clause in the Protocol to the US-Egypt Treaty.\n\n130.\n\nWith respect to the four principal decisions where tribunals interpreted denial-of-benefits clauses in US BITs and CAFTA97, the Tribunal has noted that the procedural requirements applicable to a State\u2019s exercise of its right of denial are determined in each case on the basis of the distinct factual matrix of the case and an analysis of the particular governing Treaty.\n\nSee *Pac Rim v. El Salvador,* RLA-11; *Guaracachi and Rurelec v. Bolivia,* CLA-213; *Ulysseas v. Ecuador,* RLA-32; *EMELEC v. Ecuador,* RLA-26.\n\n131.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will now review the factual matrix of the present case in relation to the issue of the denial of benefits as well as the relevant provisions of the US-Egypt BIT and its Protocol in order to determine whether the denial by Egypt to Ampal of the benefits of the Treaty on 27 January 2013 was a valid exercise of the right reserved to it under the Treaty.\n\n132.\n\nParagraph 1 of the Protocol to the Treaty, prior to 1986, read as follows:\n\n*Each Party reserves the right to deny the benefits of this Treaty to any company of either Party, or its affiliates or subsidiaries, if nationals of any third country control such company, affiliate or subsidiary; provided that, whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended for this reason, it*  *shall first consult* *with the other Party to seek a* *mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.98 (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)*\n\nC-7.\n\n133.\n\nOn 11 March 1986, Paragraph 1 of the Protocol was amended and it now reads as follows:\n\n*Each Party reserves the right to deny the benefits of this Treaty to any company of either Party, or its affiliates or subsidiaries, if nationals of any third country control such company, affiliate or subsidiary; provided that, whenever one Party concludes that the benefits of this Treaty should not be extended for this reason, it*  *shall promptly consult* *with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.99* (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)\n\nC-7.\n\n134.\n\nArticle VII of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\n*2. the parties*  *shall* *initially seek to resolve the dispute*  *by consultation* *and negotiation....*\n\n*3 (a) In the event that the legal investment dispute is not resolved under procedures specified above, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre \") for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration, if*  *within six (6) months* *of the date upon which it arose: (i) the dispute has not been settled*  *through consultation* *and negotiation....* (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)\n\n135.\n\nOn 18 May 2011, Ampal (and EGI-Fund Investors) sent Egypt a letter informing it of the existence of a legal dispute under the Egypt-US Treaty and the object of the dispute and requesting consultations with Egypt pursuant to the terms of Article VII(2) of the Treaty.100 The letter reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n*We hereby advise you of the existence of a legal investment dispute under the Treaty Between the United States of America and The Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (\"U.S.-Egypt BIT\" or \"Treaty\"). As U.S. companies, we control shares in East Mediterranean Gas S.A.E. (\"EMG\"), the owner and operator of the \"Peace Pipeline\" between Al-Arish, Egypt and Ashkelon, Israel.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Pursuant to the terms of Article VII(2) of the Treaty, we hereby request consultations with your ministries in the interest of resolving this dispute. In the event that we are not able to resolve this dispute through consultations, we intend to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Dispute (\"ICSID\") for settlement and binding arbitration. In such event, we will also encourage the other EMG shareholders to file for ICSID arbitration, and to pursue all other remedies available to such other EMG shareholders.* *We will also encourage EMG to pursue all of its remedies pursuant to all applicable contracts and laws.*\n\nSee C-101.\n\n136.\n\nOne year later, on 2 May 2012, the Request for Arbitration was filed by the Claimants (including Ampal) and registered by ICSID on 23 May 2012.\n\n137.\n\nOn 27 January 2013, Egypt wrote to Ampal. The relevant extracts of that letter provide:\n\n*In that arbitration, Ampal-American Israel Corporation (\"Ampal-American\") claims to be entitled to benefit from rights contained in the Treaty. However, based on the facts, albeit limited, which you have disclosed, we understand that Ampal-American, a company incorporated in New York, USA, is controlled by nationals of a country other than the United States of America. Indeed, it appears that Mr. Yosef Maiman and his family own approximately 62% of the voting shares of Ampal-American and control the company. The Arab Republic of Egypt understands that Mr. Maiman and his family are nationals of the State of Israel.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Pursuant to this provision [Paragraph 1 of the Protocol to the Treaty],*  *the Arab Republic of Egypt hereby exercises its right to deny Ampal-American the benefits of the Treaty,* *For the avoidance of doubt, such denial of benefits includes each and every right under the Treaty, including Article VII thereof, and is effective as of the date on which Ampal-American became controlled by nationals of a country other than the United States of America.101* (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)\n\nC-224.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal has seen and considered the many letters/notes exchanged between Egypt and the United States after 27 January 2013.102\n\nSee, *inter alia,* R-20, R-21, R-26 to R-30, R-880, R-882, R-888, R-891, R-941 to R-946.\n\n139.\n\nThe first letter from Egypt to the United States is dated 28 January 2013 and refers to Egypt\u2019s notification sent the previous day to Ampal. Egypt concludes in that letter that \"it remains available to promptly consult with the Government of the United States of America pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Protocol.\"103\n\nR-20.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, in its Note of 10 October 2013, Egypt affirmed that the purpose of the consultations contemplated by Paragraph 1 of the Protocol \"[was] to resolve any doubts concerning whether the company is, in fact, controlled within the meaning of the Protocol.\"104\n\nR-880.\n\n141.\n\nIn its last Note, dated 8 March 2014, the United States wrote:\n\n*During the consultations, the United States expressed its view that the tribunal formed under Article VII may properly resolve any disputed factual issues of ownership or control. The United States has expressed no views on those or other factual issues in that arbitration.*\n\n*The Department of State further acknowledges that the good-faith consultations, and the absence of any expressed disagreement, between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt constitute a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter, in accordance with Paragraph 1 of the Supplementary Protocol to the Treaty.*\n\n*The Department of State would appreciate the Arab Republic of Egypt confirming this understanding by return diplomatic note.*\n\n142.\n\nThe exchange between the two State Parties ended with a Note from Egypt to the United States on 17 April 2014 which concluded as follows:\n\n*We note the Department of State\u2019s acknowledgement of the good faith consultations that took place between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Supplementary Protocol of the Treaty. We also note the Department of State\u2019s observation that, in the absence of any expressed disagreement between the two Governments, such consultations have resulted in a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter.*\n\n*In response to the Department of State\u2019s invitation to the Arab Republic of Egypt to confirm this understanding, the Arab Republic of Egypt hereby confirms that the two Governments have conducted good faith consultations following its denial of the benefits of the Treaty to Ampal-American pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Supplemental Protocol of the Treaty, and that a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter has been achieved through these consultations.105*\n\nR-891.\n\n143.\n\nAs it is common ground between the parties that Mr. Maiman is a national \"of a third country\" and that he controls Ampal, the question which the Tribunal must now answer is whether, in the circumstances, Egypt has effectively denied Ampal the benefits of the Treaty.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal, in order to determine this jurisdictional issue, must interpret the text of the Treaty including its Protocol, in accordance with the relevant principles for treaty interpretation under international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n145.\n\nIt is significant to note, as expressly stated in Paragraph 1 of the Protocol, that when a Party concludes that it intends to exercise its right to deny the benefits of the Treaty to a company such as Ampal \"it shall promptly consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter\". (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)\n\n146.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of these terms of the Protocol is very clear to the Tribunal.\n\n147.\n\nThe Party wishing to invoke the denial-of-benefits provision of the Treaty has the obligation to consult with the other Party in order to search for a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter and such consultations must be held promptly.\n\n148.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal finds that these mandatory requirements have not been met.\n\n149.\n\nAs the Tribunal recorded above, after it had reached a decision to deny the benefits of the Treaty to Ampal, Egypt conveyed its decision to the United States on 23 January 2013. The United States was thus presented with a \"fait accompli\" rather than invited to engage in a process of consultation in order to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of the issue raised by Egypt.\n\n150.\n\nThere is no evidence in the correspondence between the two State Parties which followed Egypt\u2019s notice to Ampal of any consultations such as clearly envisaged in the Protocol.\n\n151.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, Egypt, by taking a decision and then inviting the United States to engage in a process of consultation, did not act in conformity with the clear terms of the Protocol. Its denial of benefits to Ampal was thus ineffective.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal noted earlier that, in 1986, after negotiations between the United States and Egypt with respect to changes to the Treaty which each country wished to introduce, a Supplementary Protocol was signed which, *inter alia,* required that a Party should \"promptly\", rather than \"first\" consult with the other Party to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution of this matter.\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert, Professor Vandevelde, has opined that by replacing the word \"first\" with the word \"promptly\", the parties \"[had] made clear that the consultations could occur \"after\" the denial of benefits\" and that \"the Treaty did not require consultations prior to a denial of benefits.\"106\n\nVandevelde Expert Legal Opinion, para. 62 at page 17.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Professor Vandevelde\u2019s opinion. Again, the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the Paragraph 1 of the Protocol, as amended, in their context, is evident. The Party who has concluded that the benefits of the Treaty should not be extended to the national of a third country has the obligation to consult with the other Party in order to seek a mutually satisfactory resolution. The object and purpose of the mandatory consultation is to find a satisfactory resolution, not to discuss whether a decision previously taken by one Party should be endorsed and accepted by the other Party. In this respect, the Tribunal finds that the State Parties\u2019 final statements in their correspondence fall short of an acceptance on the part of the United States that Egypt was entitled to deny Ampal the benefits of the Treaty.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the decision of the tribunal in *Pac-Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador107* that the denial of benefits pursuant to a clause nearly identical to that in Paragraph 1 of the Protocol in the present case was held to be effective.\n\nRLA-11.\n\n156.\n\nHowever, there is a very significant difference in the Treaty language of that case and the Treaty language in the present case. In CAFTA (the governing Treaty in the Pac-Rim decision), the consultations between the two State parties according to Article 20.4.1 of the Agreement were only discretionary108, whereas, in the present case, as noted above, the consultations are mandatory.\n\n*Pac Rim* v. *El Salvador,* RLA-11, para. 4.57.\n\n157.\n\nHaving concluded that consultations mandated by the Protocol did not take place, the Tribunal will now seek to determine when valid and effective consultations should have been held in this case.\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that on 18 May 2011109, Ampal (and EGI-Fund Investors) notified Egypt pursuant to Article VII (2) of the Treaty of the existence of a legal investment dispute under the Treaty.\n\nSee *supra* at para. 135.\n\n159.\n\nEgypt was then aware that, under the terms of Paragraph 1 of the Protocol to the Treaty, it could deny the benefits of the Treaty to Ampal, a publicly listed company controlled by Mr. Maiman, a national of a third country, but only after having initiated consultations with the United States, the other Contracting State to the Treaty.\n\n160.\n\nAccording to Article VII(2) and (3) of the Treaty, Egypt had a window of six (6) months after 18 May 2011 to seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and negotiation with Ampal. In the opinion of the Tribunal, it was during that six (6) month period that Egypt could also have initiated consultations with the United States pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the Protocol. There is no evidence in the record that such consultations took place during that period.\n\n161.\n\nIf it had done so during the window, it would have acted \"promptly\". By waiting until January 2013, more than 20 months later, it is obvious to the Tribunal that Egypt did not act promptly.\n\n162.\n\nAlthough not strictly necessary in view of the decision which it has reached that Egypt\u2019s notification to Ampal of 23 January 2013 was defective and invalid, the Tribunal will now address nevertheless the scope and effect of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention since the parties have submitted detailed and extensive arguments on this issue.\n\n163.\n\nThe central argument of the Respondent with respect to that jurisdictional issue is that its offer to arbitrate in the Treaty is always subject to its right, enshrined in the Protocol to the Treaty, to deny the benefits of the Treaty to \"mailbox\" or \"shell\" companies which, in the words of its expert, Professor Vandevelde, \"never [have] an unconditional, or vested, right to treaty protection\".110\n\nVandevelde Expert Legal Opinion, para. 121 at p. 40.\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent submits that by invoking the denial-of-benefits provision in the Protocol to the Treaty after Ampal had submitted its claim to ICSID arbitration, it did not withdraw its previously given consent to arbitration but rather exercised its right to deny benefits which was reserved within that consent.\n\n165.\n\nOn the other hand, the central argument of the Claimants is that the jurisdiction of the Centre is to be assessed at the time that jurisdiction is invoked, to wit when the Request for Arbitration is registered and that, as clearly set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"no Party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" In short, say the Claimants, a denial of benefits such as the present one cannot have retroactive effect. It can only be effective prospectively.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 interpretation, says the Respondent, would give no \"effet utile\" to the denial of benefits provision in the Protocol.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the jurisdiction of the Centre must be determined at the time that the Request for Arbitration is registered.\n\n168.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is very clear. The jurisdiction of the Centre is to be assessed at the time that jurisdiction is invoked, which is when the investor\u2019s Request for Arbitration is registered by the Centre. When jurisdiction has crystallized, \"no Party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\", says plainly Article 25(1).\n\n169.\n\nAs the Egypt-US Treaty and its Protocol must be read in the light of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal finds that there cannot be an embedded conditionality in the Treaty which could be triggered after the submission of the dispute to arbitration.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the opinion of Professor Vandevelde that Egypt could deny the benefits of the Treaty to a Claimant such as Ampal \"at any time\" after the Request for Arbitration has been filed.111 Such denial, to be effective, must be made prior to the filing and registration of the Request for Arbitration. In fact, the Tribunal recalls that Professor Vandevelde agreed in cross-examination during the hearing that a denial of the benefits of the US Treaty only has a prospective effect.112\n\nVandevelde Expert Legal Opinion, para. 121 at p. 40.\n\nTr. Day 7 Day 7, 212:5-16 (Counsel for the Claimants and Professor Vandevelde): \"Q. Prior to that time [of a denial of benefits], the jurisdiction that the tribunal did have will be left untouched; is that correct? A. That would be my understanding, yes. Q. So the denial does not erase jurisdiction that existed prior to the denial? A. The word that 1 used was \u2018terminates\u2019 the jurisdiction: that the benefits have been denied as of a certain moment, and as of that moment the investor is no longer able to avail itself of any of the benefits of the treaty. Q. But it doesn\u2019t seek to change the past? A. That\u2019s correct.\"\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that its conclusion that the jurisdiction of the Centre must be determined at the time it is seized of the dispute is in conformity with the rule of the International Court of Justice with respect to the time when jurisdiction is vested in the Court. That rule and its effect are well set out by the Court in the *Right of Passage* decision where it held:\n\n*It is a rule of law generally accepted, as well as one acted upon in the past by the Court, that, once the Court has been validly seized of a dispute, unilateral action by the Respondent State in terminating its Declaration, in whole or in part, cannot divest the Court of jurisdiction.113*\n\n*Portugal* v. *India,* CLA-214, p. 142.\n\n172.\n\nThis conclusion of the Tribunal is also in conformity with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Protocol and the Treaty that for the denial of benefits to be effective, there must be consultations as mandated by the Treaty and such consultations must be made promptly.\n\n173.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent\u2019s denial of benefits to Ampal of 27 January 2013 is not effective and the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction resting on this ground is dismissed.\n\n*c)*  *Ampal\u2019s interest in EMG*\n-------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has made the following objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in its Post-Hearing Brief:\n\n*The highly convoluted and opaque structure through which Ampal holds its interest in EMG involves not only numerous related intermediary companies, the corporate and financial relationships (including intercompany debts) of which have never been established or explained, but also entirely fails to take account of intervening third party rights including loans, the terms of which are nowhere in the record of this arbitration.... All these matters potentially seriously impair the flow of funds up the corporate chain from EMG to Ampal, contrary to the premise of Ampal\u2019s claim.114*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of the flow of funds was indeed raised by the Respondent in its written submissions prior to the evidentiary hearing. However, the issue was raised in relation to quantum. The Respondent only made an objection to jurisdiction on this basis in its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n176.\n\nAccording to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), this objection should have been made \"no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\".\n\n177.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal denies the Respondent\u2019s belated objection which has been made for the first time in its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n**B. Ratione Personae Competence over EGI-Fund Investors and EGI-Series**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is a basic principle of international investment law that a claimant bears the burden of showing that it has met the jurisdictional requirements of a treaty.115\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 164. See *Pac Rim v. El Salvador,* RLA-11, para. 2.9: *\"[A]ll relevant facts supporting [the Tribunal\u2019s] jurisdiction must be established by the Claimant at this jurisdictional stage and not merely assumed in the Claimant's favour.\"*\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate their contention that United States nationals have a \"substantial interest\" in EGI-Fund Investors and EGI-Series as required in the US Treaty, and thus the Tribunal lacks the *ratione personae* competence over these two entities.\n\n180.\n\nIn respect of EGI-Fund Investors, the Claimants argued for the first time in their Reply Memorial that the *\"only one part\"* of the ownership structure of EGI-Fund Investors that is relevant to their allegation that US nationals have a *\"substantial interest\"* in the company is the three Irrevocable Trusts created in 2004 by the children of Mr. Zell (the \"Zell Children Trusts\").116 According to the Respondent, this is contrary to the Claimants\u2019 previous allegation that *\"92% of* [EGI-Fund Investors] *is held by trusts established for the benefit of Mr. Samuel Zell, his children,*  *and their children,* *all of whom are US nationals\"(emphasis* added by the Tribunal).117\n\nReply, para. 210.\n\nMemorial, para. 168.\n\n181.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this new argument confirms that the Claimants\u2019 allegations concerning the interests in EGI-Fund Investors should not be taken at face value, especially in light of the correction which they bring to the Certificate of Managing Member of EGI-Fund Investors.118\n\nRejoinder, para. 160. See C-226.\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the Claimants have failed to provide any evidence to substantiate the alleged US nationality of Mr. Zell\u2019s grandchildren119 in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s order to disclose: *\"[f]or any interest in EGI-Fund Investors held in trust from 2007 to the present.... Nationality certificates, passports or equivalent Documents of all beneficiaries that are natural persons.\"120*\n\nRejoinder, para. 159. Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 4 granting the Respondent\u2019s Request No. 42; Tr. Day 9, 28:38-29;l2.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 addition to the record of extracts of the US Code of Federal Regulations121 is part of a series of inappropriate attempts by which they now ask the Tribunal to infer, as a legal matter, the very fact of the Zell grandchildren\u2019s nationalities, in relation to which they refuse to provide evidence.122\n\nC-655.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34.\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, in a similar vein, during the hearing, the Claimants\n\n*attempted to show birth certificates of the Zell grandchildren on a restricted basis to the Tribunal and Egypt\u2019s international counsel, without allowing Egypt or its representatives ESLA to view or independently verify them. These documents do not form part of the evidentiary record and thus cannot be relied on; moreover, this cannot remedy the Claimants\u2019 procedural and due process violations, which have deprived Egypt of the opportunity to verify, assess and respond to the EGI Claimants\u2019 alleged U.S. nationality.123*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34. See also Tr. Day 1, 28:38-29:12; Tr. Day 9, 270:14-273:1.\n\n185.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have withheld all information concerning the identity or nationality of the next-in-line beneficiaries of the Zell Children Trusts, who are presumably the spouses of Mr. Zell\u2019s children.124\n\nC-454-C-456.\n\n186.\n\nIn any event, avers the Respondent,\n\n*[t]he Claimants have... still failed to prove a substantial U.S. interest in the EGI Claimants at the relevant dates for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae, i.e. between 2008, from when their cause of action allegedly arose, and 2012, when they initiated this arbitration. To do so, they would have had to produce \u2018[n]ationality certificates, passports or equivalent Documents\u2019 covering the material period, in* *accordance with Egypt\u2019s document request, which they have consistently refused to do.125*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\n187.\n\nOn the basis of these unsubstantiated and contradictory allegations, the Respondent argues that it cannot be expected to accept the standing of EGI-Fund Investors which brings claims for over US$ 200 million in this arbitration.126\n\nRejoinder, para. 164.\n\n188.\n\nIn respect of EGI-Series, the Respondent submits the following:\n\n(i) The Claimants assert that EGI-Series meets the treaty\u2019s national requirements because EGI-Fund Investors has held a 91.67% interest in that company since August 2008.127 The Claimants\u2019 failure to demonstrate that EGI-Fund Investors meets the Treaty\u2019s nationality requirements therefore applies *mutatis mutandis* to EGI-Series says the Respondent.128\n\n(ii) In any event, the selective and incomplete disclosure of evidence concerning the corporate structure of EGI-Series does not confirm the portion of that company alleged to be owned by EGI-Fund Investors asserts the Respondent. The Certificate of Formation of EGI-Series indicates that it is a \"series limited liability company\". The Claimants allege in their Reply that \"EGI-Series Investment is composed of two series\", the \"EGI-EMG Series\" and the \"EGI-SSE I Series\"129. The evidence produced to support this contention is a \"Supplement to EGI-Series Investments, L.L.C.\" dated 29 February 2009, pursuant to which the \"EGI-SEE I Series\" was created130. The Respondent argues that this document is dated and that the Claimants have provided no evidence as to whether or not any further \"series\" of EGI-Series were established before 2012. In the event that EGI-Series is also composed of other \"series\", this could result in a dilution of EGI-Fund Investors\u2019 ownership of that company\u2019s capital and, consequently, any substantial interest in EGI-Series Investments by US nationals says the Respondent.131\n\n(iii)The Respondent contends that the Claimants have produced no evidence explaining the nature of EGI-Fund Investor\u2019s ownership interest in EGI-Series. According to a \"Contribution Agreement\" signed between those parties on 18 August 2008,132 EGI-Fund Investors was allocated a 100% \"Series Percentage Interest\" of the EGI-EMG Series of the LLC, as defined in a separate contract, a \"Series Limited Liability Company Agreement\" dated 14 March 2008, which the Claimants have chosen not to disclose. EGI-Fund Investors\u2019 ownership of the \"EGI-EMG Series\" of EGI-Series cannot be assumed to result in the same proportion of ownership of the company\u2019s entire capital says the Respondent.133\n\nMemorial, para. 86. In support of the ownership of EGI-Series Investments by EGI- Fund Investors, the Claimants have produced a Certificate of Secretary of EGI-Series Investments LLC, C-42, and a \"Contribution Agreement\" dated 15 August 2008, C-l49.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 169 (i).\n\nReply, para. 214.\n\nC-379.\n\nRejoinder, para. 168.\n\nC-149.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 169 (iii).\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Tribunal has *ratione personae* competence over EGI-Fund Investors and EGI-Series since US nationals hold a substantial interest in both entities.\n\n190.\n\nIn respect of EGI-Fund Investors, the Claimants argue that they have provided a Certificate of Managing Member of EGI-Fund Investors which (i) states that, since 17 April 2007, 92% of the membership interest in the company has been indirectly held by trusts established for the benefit of Samuel Zell, his three children and his minor grandchildren; and (ii) includes copies of the US passports of Samuel Zell and his three children.134 According to the Claimants, this is sufficient to establish that US nationals have a substantial interest in EGI-Fund Investors.\n\nC-226. For evidence of the Managing Member\u2019s appointment and its powers, see C-451 and C-452.\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the trust structure through which the Zell family members hold their interests in EGI-Fund Investors is complex. However, if the Tribunal considers that evidence beyond the Certificate of Managing Member is necessary to establish the \"substantial interest\" held by the Zell family, only one part of that structure need be examined aver the Claimants. That part is three Irrevocable Trusts (the JoAnn Zell Irrevocable Trust, the Kellie Zell Irrevocable Trust, and the Matthew Zell Irrevocable Trust) that hold interests in EGI-Fund Investors. The Claimants submit that those trusts made original capital commitments to EGI-Fund Investors totalling US$432 million135- a \"substantial\" interest - corresponding to 43.2% of the capital of EGI-Fund Investors.136 On 31 December 2008, the membership interest of the Irrevocable Trusts in EGI-Fund Investors increased to more than 90%.137 The entire beneficial interest in those trusts is held by the grandchildren of Mr. Zell, a US citizen.138 The structure is illustrated in the following diagram.139\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/72cfab222bc9f9f01ffbab01b0c417a3b0025eab.png)\n\nC-231 - C-233.\n\nC-452.\n\nC-453.\n\nC-454 - C-457.\n\nReply, para. 210.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants concede that one correction needs to be made to the Certificate of Managing member of EGI-Fund Investors. The 92% interest held by the Zell family in EGI-Fund Investors is not only held by Mr. Zell, his three children, and his grandchildren, but also by the spouses of two of Mr. Zell's children140, who are also US nationals. But neither Mr. Zell\u2019s children, nor their spouses, hold an interest in the Irrevocable Trusts, which represent 90.3% of the interest in EGI-Fund Investors.141. All of that interest is held by Mr. Zell\u2019s grandchildren. The Claimants have already provided passports showing that Mr. Zell and his three children are US citizens and were born in the US.142 According to the Claimants, it follows from the US citizenship of Mr. Zell\u2019s children that his grandchildren are US citizens.143\n\nC-458.\n\n**Reply, para. 212.**\n\nC-226.\n\nCLA-131.\n\n193.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimants have not met their burden of proof in relation to the nationality of Mr. Zell\u2019s grandchildren, the Claimants assert the following:144\n\n(i) At the hearing, the Tribunal accepted the Claimants\u2019 proposal that a copy of the birth certificates of Mr. Zell\u2019s grandchildren be kept available and under seal with the ICSID Secretariat;145\n\n(ii) Mr. Zell\u2019s grandchildren were born in Illinois, Colorado and California;146\n\n(iii) There is only one reason why a person born in the US, to known parents, would fail to acquire US nationality at birth. That is if the person was not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States at that time.147 The only basis for that would be if he or she was born to a foreign diplomatic officer.148 There is no ground to think that any of the parents of the grandchildren was a foreign diplomatic officer. The US passports of Mr. Zell\u2019s three children are on the record149 and their spouses were all born in the United States.150\n\n(iv) If Egypt had a genuine objection to the evidence presented by the Claimants, it could have explored it in cross-examination of Mr. Zell. Egypt did not ask him a single question regarding his children or his grandchildren.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15.\n\nTr. Day 9, 276:10-20. See also Tr. Day 5, 208:20-209:5.\n\nTr.

(b).\n\nC-226, pp 4-6.\n\nThey were born in California, Minnesota, Texas, and Illinois, as shown in the copies of the birth certificates of the grandchildren of Mr. Zell held under seal with the ICSID Secretary.\n\n194.\n\nIn respect of EGI-Series, the Claimants assert that a scries limited liability company under Delaware law may be composed of multiple series, each of which assumes its own rights and obligations, which cannot be enforced by or against any other series of the company or against the company as a whole.151 EGI-Series is composed of two series, the EGI-EMG Series (the series which holds an indirect interest in EMG) and the EG1-SSE I Series152:\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/6813c59fe68c5734488de3ada442a208df7bc7ad.png)\n\nReply, para. 213.\n\nReply, para. 214. See Contribution Agreement, C-)49.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants submit that EGI-Fund Investors hold a 91.67% interest in the EGI-EMG Series of EGI-Series Investments,153 EGI-Fund Investors holds a 78.22% direct interest in the EG1-SSE 1 Series, and trusts established for the benefit of the Zell family hold more than 90% of the interest in the Series as a whole.154 Thus, even if the EG1-SSE I Series is taken into consideration, there is no diluting of the indirect interest held by members of the Zell family.155\n\nC-42.\n\nC-523 and C-379. See diagram above.\n\nReply, para. 214.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n196.\n\nWith respect to this objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Respondent essentially alleges that the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of proving that US nationals had a \"substantial interest\" in EGI-Fund Investors and EGI-Series.\n\n*a)*  *EGI-Fund Investors*\n--------------------------\n\n197.\n\nWhile the Claimants only filed the pertinent evidence with their Reply, the record now reveals that there are three Irrevocable Trusts that hold more than a 90% interest in EGI-Fund Investors. The entire beneficial interest in those trusts is held by the minor grandchildren of Mr. Samuel Zell.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Zell and his three children are US nationals. The only outstanding question which the Tribunal has to answer is whether the beneficiaries of these three Irrevocable Trusts, to wit Mr. Zell\u2019s grandchildren, are US nationals. If the Tribunal finds that they are US nationals, it will necessarily follow that US nationals have a \"substantial interest\" in EGI-Fund Investors since they hold a 90.3% interest in this Claimant.\n\n199.\n\nFor personal security reasons invoked by Mr. Zell, the Claimants\u2019 counsel have only allowed members of the Tribunal and the Respondent\u2019s international counsel to sight the Zell grandchildren\u2019s birth certificates which are kept under seal by the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n200.\n\nAs the Respondent objects to this belated *in camera* production of the Zell grandchildren\u2019s birth certificates, the Tribunal has decided that it will not decide the Respondent\u2019s objection to its jurisdiction on the basis of these birth certificates.\n\n201.\n\nHaving reviewed and considered the other evidence adduced by the Claimants on the issue of the US nationality of the Zell grandchildren, the Tribunal finds that the beneficiaries of the Irrevocable Trusts, the Zell grandchildren, are US nationals.\n\n202.\n\nFirstly, according to the representation of counsel for the Claimants as instructed by their client Mr. Zell, all his grandchildren were born in the United States.\n\n203.\n\nSecondly, their grandfather, Samuel Zell, and their parents are US nationals.156\n\nSee a copy of the passports of Samuel Zell and his children at C-226.\n\n204.\n\nThirdly, the uncontradicted evidence of the Claimants is that, in such circumstances, there is only one situation in which a person born in the United States would not acquire US nationality at birth and this situation does not apply in the present case.157\n\nIf he or she was born to a foreign diplomatic officer. See C-655. United States Code of Federal Regulations, 8 CFR section 101.3 para. (b).\n\n205.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that US nationals have a \"substantial interest\" in Claimant EGI-Fund Investors and this objection to jurisdiction of the Respondent is dismissed.\n\n*b)*  *EGI-Series*\n------------------\n\n206.\n\nEGI-Fund Investors own a 91.67% interest in the EGI-EMG Series of EGI-Series.\n\n207.\n\nSince the Tribunal has declared itself satisfied that US nationals have a substantial interest in EGI-Fund Investors, it follows that it is equally satisfied that US nationals have a substantial interest in EGI-Series and the Tribunal so finds.\n\n208.\n\nThis objection of Respondent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**C.** Ratione Personae Competence over Mr. David Fischer\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Mr. Fischer has not proved his alleged US$ 15 million investment through Prudence Energy Ltd, a vehicle through which (as well as through several other intermediary companies and trusts) he claims to hold a 1.24% indirect interest in EMG.158 The only further investment Mr. Fischer made was a minimal US$ 20,000 equity interest in a holding company, DF Holdings Investment Ltd.159\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 32.\n\nSee C-41 (c) and (b).\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in cross-examination during the evidentiary hearing, the Claimants\u2019 quantum expert, Mr. Nicholson of FTI:\n\n(i) admitted that he had not \"seen the terms of any loans\" from Mr. Fischer to Prudence Energy Ltd., nor any other reliable evidence of that loan despite claiming that Mr. Fischer\u2019s investment took the form of a loan;160 and\n\n(ii) Confirmed that there is no evidence that Mr. Fischer still owned the alleged loan to Prudence Energy Ltd when he initiated this arbitration.161\n\nTr. Day 8 145:17-21, 135:16-17; 134:4-140:20.\n\nTr. Day 8, 136:2-6.\n\n211.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal does not have *ratione personae* competence over Mr. David Fischer.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Mr. David Fischer\u2019s investment has been proved :\n\n*Exhibit C-41[b] is a Declaration of Trust issued by Line Holdings Limited (Gibraltar) in favor of DF Holdings Investments Limited. The property held in trust by Line Holdings Limited for the absolute benefit of DF Holdings Investments Limited is 15,000 shares (75%) in Prudence Energy Limited.*\n\n*Exhibit C-41[d] is a Declaration of Trust issued by the same Line Holdings Limited, in favor of Mr. David Fischer. The property held in trust by Line Holdings Limited for the absolute benefit of Mr. Fischer is 20,000 shares (100%) in DF Holdings Investments Limited.*\n\n*By these two trusts Mr. Fischer is the beneficial owner of 75% of Prudence Energy Ltd. Prudence Energy Ltd in turn owns 13.79% of EGI-EMG LP, the corporate vehicle created by the* *EGI group of investors to make their investment in EMG.....*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*The Declarations of Trust in question recite that they were executed \"on the 2nd May 2012.\" Exhibit C-41[b] recites that although signed in 2012 it has \"effect from the 26th June 2007,\" and Exhibit C-41[d] recites that it has \"effect from the 25th June 2007.\" Egypt says in its Submission that this amounts to a claim of \"retroactive effect\" and adds that: \"such allegations, however, is [sic] ineffective to overcome Mr.* *Fischer\u2019s evident lack of standing in this arbitration.\"*\n\n*The evidence that the Claimants have filed is sufficient proof of Mr. Fischer\u2019s uninterrupted beneficial ownership of Prudence Energy Ltd from 26 June 2007 until 2 May 2012. The Declarations signed in May 2012 attest that the interests have been held since June 2007.*\n\n*There were also equivalent Declarations of Trust issued by the same trustee to each of the same beneficiaries concerning the same trust property on 26 and 25 June 2007 respectively. These two Declarations signed in 2007 are provided... as Exhibits C-317 and C-318. When these were replaced on 2 May 2012 by the two new Declarations of Trust filed with the Request for Arbitration, they had to be cancelled; this is evidenced by the copies of the cancelled 2007 Declarations provided... as Exhibits C-319 and C-320.*\n\n*As demonstrated by Exhibits C-41[e], C-41[f] and C-41[g]...* *the company created as Parolo Enterprises Limited ultimately changed its name to DF Holdings Investments Limited. This explains the difference in the name of the beneficiary entity listed in the Declaration of Trust of June 2007 (Exhibit C-317)* *(Parolo Enterprises Limited) and that listed in the Declaration dated 2 May 2012 (Exhibit C-41[b]) (DF Holdings Investments Limited). This change in name had no effect on the legal personality of the entity now named DF Holdings Investments Limited.*\n\n*There cannot be any reasonable dispute about Mr. Fischer\u2019s ownership of the investment at all relevant times,...162*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, paras. 13-20.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants argue that whether the funds that Mr. Fischer provided to Prudence Energy Ltd for investment in EMG were structured as a loan has no bearing on whether Mr. Fischer holds an equity interest in Prudence Energy, and therefore, in EMG. That equity interest constitutes an investment, and its diminution in value is the measure of his loss.163\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\n214.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal has *ratione personae* competence over Mr. David Fischer.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n215.\n\nIn contrast to the Tribunal\u2019s earlier conclusion vis-\u00e0-vis the objections of the Respondent to its jurisdiction over EGI-Fund Investors and EGI-Series, in the case of the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Mr. David Fischer the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Claimants have discharged their burden of proof.\n\n216.\n\nIt is trite to say that the party who makes an assertion has the burden of proving it. Accordingly, the burden of proof to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over, in this instance, the Claimant David Fischer rests upon David Fischer. The proposition that he who asserts must prove is applicable in investment treaty arbitration.164\n\nSee *Saipem S.p.A,* v. *People's Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, para. 83.\n\n217.\n\nAt the jurisdictional stage of this case, Mr. Fischer has the burden of proving that he beneficially owns 75% of Prudence Energy Ltd which in turn owns 13.79% of EGI-EMG L.P., the corporate vehicle through which all Claimants other than Ampal hold their interests in EMG.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal has heard the evidence of Mr. Fischer and has considered the submissions of Claimants which, they aver, demonstrate \"Mr. Fischer\u2019s ownership of [his] investment at all relevant times\".165\n\nSee *supra* at para. 212 and Claimants\u2019 Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, paras. 13-20.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to determine whether Mr. Fischer has satisfied his jurisdictional burden. On this point, it is important to keep in mind that the burden of proof is not necessarily satisfied by simply producing evidence. As Professor Bin Cheng has neatly stated: \"a party having the burden of proof must not only bring evidence in support of his allegations, but must also convince the Tribunal of their truth, lest they be disregarded for want, or insufficiency of proof.\"166\n\nBin Cheng, *General Principles oF Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (, 1953, p. 329, CLA-153\n\n220.\n\nThe definition of an investment under Article 1(1) of the Germany/Egypt Treaty requires that \"[the] asset [be] established or acquired by an investor of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State...\". The Claimant, a German national, is attempting to prove beneficial ownership over what he asserts is an investment covered by the Treaty through his alleged beneficial ownership of Prudence Energy Ltd.\n\n221.\n\nIt is not an unusual feature of international corporate business that companies and individuals make their investments through a number of offshore vehicles, often with the view to avoid fiscal liabilities in the home territory of the ultimate owner. Frequently, this involves transferring the title to shares to third parties who may hold them on such terms as may be agreed.\n\n222.\n\nIn this case, Mr. Fischer admitted that the structure of his investment was deliberately disguised to protect him from tax exposure in Germany and to ensure that he could not be identified as the investor in the event that his investment was successful.\n\n223.\n\nThe only evidence submitted in respect of Mr. Fischer\u2019s beneficial ownership is a one line statement in one of the exhibits (C-318) that the shares in DF Holdings Investments Limited are beneficially owned by Mr. Fischer. No trust deed evidencing the double blind trust has been submitted to the Tribunal. This appears to be consistent with an intention to ensure that Mr. Fischer could not be identified as the investor, should his investment be successful.\n\n224.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal has no clear evidence before it relating to the terms of such trust or beneficial ownership.\n\n225.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that many of the documents produced by the Claimants in support of Mr. Fischer\u2019s alleged investment are executed on 2 May 2012 but, conveniently, they are said to take effect retroactively on 25 June 2007, five years earlier.\n\n226.\n\nIn view of the many missing evidentiary links, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Fischer has not discharged his burden of proving that he made an investment that is protected under the German/Egypt BIT. Accordingly, Mr. Fischer is not a protected investor.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it has no jurisdiction over Claimant, David Fischer, and this objection of Respondent is therefore sustained.\n\n**D.** Ratione Materiae Competence over the Claimants\u2019 Gas Supply Claims\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione personae* over Mr. David Fischer, the Tribunal needs not summarize the parties\u2019 arguments specific to the Germany Treaty.\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent reminds the Tribunal that out of the US$ 882.6 million which the Claimants claim in total,167 approximately US$ 700 million concern alleged damages which the Claimants suffered due to EGPC and EGAS\u2019s alleged failure to supply EMG with gas under the GSPA (the **\"Gas Supply Dispute\").168**\n\nSee FTI Letter, Appendix 4 (revised).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 172. Respondent\u2019s Opening Slide 221.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Gas Supply Dispute is purely contractual in nature, and thus falls outside the scope of the arbitration clauses in Article VII of the US Treaty, with the result that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over these claims. In any event, because a necessary element of the Claimants\u2019 claims pertaining to the Gas Supply Dispute is a breach of the GSPA, the Respondent avers that the essential basis of the claims is contractual in nature and, as such, falls outside this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.169\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 173.\n\n231.\n\nHowever, the Respondent acknowledges that, if the Tribunal agrees that the Gas Supply Dispute is contractual in nature, it would still need to decide the Claimants\u2019 tax claims, subject to the Respondent\u2019s separate objection in that respect.170\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Slide 219.\n\n232.\n\nIn support of its argument, the Respondent submits that all of the Claimants\u2019 claims concerning the Gas Supply Dispute are claims for alleged breaches of the GSPA. Those claims include171:\n\n(i) The claim concerning renegotiations in the midst of non-deliveries - the Respondent argues that the framework governing EGPC and EGAS\u2019s obligation to deliver gas to EMG is set out at Articles 2.1, 6, 7 and 16 of Annex 1 to the GSPA;172\n\n(ii) The claim that gas was withheld to compel renegotiation - the Respondent argues that this claim is the same as the previous one;173\n\n(iii) The claim concerning the First Amendment to the GSPA - the Respondent argues that any claims concerning the First Amendment, or the performance of the GSPA as amended, are entirely contractual in nature;174\n\n(iv) The claim concerning the failure to secure continuous gas supply - the Respondent argues that this is simply a different label for the Claimants\u2019 claim that EGPC and EGAS allegedly failed to perform the GSPA;175\n\n(v) The claim concerning severe supply shortfalls and failure to protect the pipeline -the Respondent argues that these contentions are exclusively determined by the GSPA: no other instrument makes provisions for On-Sale Notices (Article 6 of Annex 1 to the GSPA), for *force majeure* (Section 16.3 of Annex 1 to the GSPA), for contractual termination rights (Section 2.5.2 of the GSPA) or for the circumstances under which EMG may have been legally entitled to receive gas (Articles 2.1, 6, 7 and 16 of Annex 1 to the GSPA);176 and\n\n(vi) The claim concerning the repudiation of gas supply obligations - the Respondent argues that EGPC and EGAS\u2019s contractual termination rights are set forth at Section 2.5 of Annex 1 to the GSPA.177\n\nThey exclude the claim concerning the revocation of EGM\u2019s tax-free status which is discussed in the following section of the present Decision.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 179-186.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 188-191.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 192.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 193-196.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 197-201\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 202-203.\n\n233.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Gas Supply Dispute is purely contractual in nature, the Respondent submits that it thus falls outside the scope of the arbitration clauses in the Treaties. According to the Respondent, this is evidenced by the Claimants\u2019 elaborate submissions on the GSPA\u2019s construction under English law.\n\n234.\n\nIn respect of the US Treaty, Article VII applies to the resolution of disputes *\"involving* *(i) the interpretation or application of an investment agreement between a Party and a national or company of the other Party; or (ii) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\".*\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent argues that none of the claims which the Claimants raise in the Gas Supply Dispute concern a right \"conferred or created by this Treaty\" because those claims are all contractual in nature as shown above and arise from the GSPA, an independent legal instrument to which neither the Claimants nor the Respondent are party.178\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 21.\n\n236.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent avers that an arbitral tribunal constituted pursuant to a Treaty lacks jurisdiction over purely contractual claims. In support of its argument the Respondent cites the following ICSID decisions:\n\n(i) *Gustav F W Homester GmbH & Co KG* v. *Republic of Ghana (\"Homester v. Ghana\") \u2014*\n\n*As noted earlier in this Award, almost all of the allegations which make up Hamester\u2019s claim of breach of the BIT, whether relating to allegations of arbitrary or discriminatory treatment; unfair and inequitable treatment; or expropriation, concern the conduct of Cocobod, in relation to Article* 7 *of the JVA. This conduct was contractual and not sovereign in nature. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that Hamester\u2019s so-called \u2018treaty claims, \u2019 however skilfully repackaged, are inextricably linked to the JVA and are in reality contract claims. To use the language of the award in the Vivendi Annulment case, \u2018the essential basis\u2019 of Hamester\u2019s claims is purely contractual.179*\n\n(ii) *Malicorp Limited v. The Arab Republic of Egypt ([Malicorp v. Egypt\")180-* the Respondent recalls that the Claimants seek to distinguish this case on the basis that the claimant in that case was a party to the contract and, in contrast, the Claimants are not parties to the GSPA. The Respondent argues that whether the Claimants are parties to the GSPA or not is irrelevant to the issue of whether, by resolving the contractual dispute concerning the performance and termination of the GSPA, one also resolves the Gas Supply Dispute and vice versa. On that issue, the tribunal in *Malicorp* was clear: a breach of contract may only amount to a violation of the treaty when the breach *\"could not be resolved by using the ordinary procedure\"181.* Because the Gas Supply Dispute before this Tribunal falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CRCICA tribunal says the Respondent, it *\"enables all submissions and arguments to be exhausted\"*, with the conclusion that this ICSID Tribunal cannot have jurisdiction over the same dispute.182\n\n(i) *Iberdrola Energia S.A.* v. *Republic of Guatemala ([Iberdrola* v. *Guatemala\"]183-* the Respondent recalls that the Claimants seek to distinguish that award by asserting that the tribunal concluded that it had no jurisdiction because the claimant based its treaty claims on breaches of Guatemalan law, not breach of contract. The Respondent argues that this distinction is irrelevant: *\"the point remains that if the legal source of the obligation is not the treaty itself a tribunal constituted pursuant to that treaty does not enjoy jurisdiction over a dispute concerning the obligation\u2019s breach\".184*\n\n(ii) *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican States (\"Azinian v. Mexico\"]185-* the Respondent recalls that the tribunal in *Azinian* rejected the claimants\u2019 claim for expropriation, finding that it was a disguised attempt to claim for wrongful termination of the concession contract which was pending before the courts of the host State. The Respondent argues that this decision applies *mutatis mutandis* to the present case as the Claimants\u2019 claims are based on allegations of breach of contract and the dispute concerning the termination of the GSPA is pending before the appropriate forum under the GSPA, namely the CRCICA Tribunal.186\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, RLA-9, para. 329. Respondent\u2019s Opening Slide 201. See also slides 202-204.\n\n*Malicorp Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARI3/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, RLA-10.\n\n*Malicorp v. Egypt,* RLA-10, para. 103(c).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 222-226.\n\n*Iberdrola Energia, S.A.* v. *Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5, Award, 17 August 2012 (Unofficial English Translation), RLA-12.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 228.\n\n*Azinian v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, RLA-1.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 229-231.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Gas Supply Dispute falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the CRCICA Tribunal, a tribunal constituted pursuant to the GSPA, and which has upheld its jurisdiction187. The Respondent submits that the CRCICA Tribunal is considering, *inter alia,* the same issues which the Claimants seek to disguise as violations of the Treaties in these proceedings188. The Respondent avers that both the commercial and investment *fora* could not have jurisdiction over the same claims.189\n\nCRCICA Partial Award, R-813.\n\nNamely :\n\n(i) EGPC and EGAS\u2019s exercise of their right to terminate the GSPA due to EMG\u2019s continued failure to pay for gas delivered to it;  \n (ii) EGPC and EGAS\u2019s consistent delivery of gas to EMG and EMG\u2019s persistent failure to pay for the gas it received;  \n (iii) EGPC and EGAS\u2019s entitlement to reduce or stop the delivery of gas when under force majeure due to terrorist attacks to the pipeline; and  \n (iv) EMG\u2019s failure to provide On-Sale Notices as required by the GSPA before being entitled to receive further gas by EGPC and EGAS.\n\nSee EGPC and EGAS\u2019s Notice for Arbitration in CRCICA Case No. 829/2012 dated 30 Aprils 2012, Exhibit R-414.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 235-236.\n\n238.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that should the Tribunal decide that it has jurisdiction over the Gas Supply Dispute, it should not exercise its jurisdiction since all of the Claimants\u2019 claims concerning the Gas Supply Dispute would be inadmissible as they require a prior finding that the GSPA itself has been breached.190\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 174.\n\n239.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent submits that should the Tribunal decide that it has jurisdiction to determine the Claimants\u2019 claims concerning the Gas Supply Dispute, the Tribunal would only be able to exercise its jurisdiction once a determination by the CRCICA Tribunal has been made that EGPC and EGAS breached the GSPA by failing to perform or by terminating the GSPA unlawfully.191\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 286 and 287.\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, for this Tribunal to hold the Respondent liable, it must be satisfied, as a matter of law, that EGPC and EGAS were under an obligation to supply gas at all material times under the circumstances or that EGPC and EGAS were not legally justified in informing EMG that should it persist to pay for gas it received and sold onwards, they would terminate the GSPA.192\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 289.\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this prior determination does not fall to be made by this Tribunal but rather by the CRCICA Tribunal, the appropriate forum under the GSPA. Therefore, the Respondent avers that\n\n*until the dispute concerning the performance and the determination of the GSPA is resolves by the appropriate forum, the Claimants\u2019 claims in this arbitration are inadmissible due to them being premature. At the very least, the Tribunal cannot exercise its jurisdiction over such claims because to do so could lead to conflicting decisions by the investment and commercial arbitral tribunals over what is essentially the same dispute and, even if it does not lead to conflicting decisions, may pave the way for the Claimants and EMG to recover twice for what is the same wrong and, correspondingly, the same loss.193*\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 294-295.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has *ratione materiae* competence over the Claimants\u2019 claims. They assert that all of their claims in this arbitration are based on the contention that Egypt has breached the Treaties and international law. There can be no doubt that the Tribunal has subject-matter jurisdiction over claims that Egypt has breached the Treaties aver the Claimants.194\n\nReply, para. 220.\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Egypt\u2019s objection depends entirely on the accusation that the Claimants have submitted contract claims disguised as treaty claims, which is untrue. The Claimants are not and do not pretend to be party to the Source GSPA or any other contractual instrument to which EMG is a party, but since shares in EMG are a protected investment held by the Claimants, breach of EMG\u2019s contractual rights by Egypt is a fact relevant to whether Egypt has breached its treaty obligations.195 As the annulment committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina* observed when annulling the tribunal\u2019s award for refusing to interpret an underlying contract when assessing whether Argentina had breached its treaty obligations, *\"[i]t is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction... and another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard, of international law.\"196*\n\nReply, para. 221 and 226.\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic (\"Aguas del Aconquija\u00a0v. Argentina\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, CLA-85, para. 105. See also *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A.S.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 November 2005, RLA-150, para. 215.\n\n244.\n\nIn response to (i) the Respondent\u2019s argument that tribunals established under investment treaties do not have jurisdiction over claims that, at their essence, are contractual in nature, and (ii) the cases which the Respondent cites in support of its argument, the Claimants submit the following:\n\n(i) *Malicorp* v. *Egypt197-* the Claimants argue that this decision does not support Egypt\u2019s jurisdictional objection since the tribunal in that case took jurisdiction over the dispute and proceeded to decide whether Egypt had breached the applicable investment treaty.198\n\n(ii) *Iberdrola* v. *Guatemala199-* the Claimants argue that unlike the claimant in *Iberdrola,* the Claimants\u2019 case does not depend on breach of contractual obligations. Rather, even if entities under the instruction and control of the Egyptian State complied with all of their contractual obligations, Egypt breached the Treaties by, among other conduct, failing to uphold the sovereign assurances and commitments on which the Claimants relied to invest and failing to protect the Claimants\u2019 investment as required by the Treaties.200\n\n(iii) *Azinian* v. *Mexico201-* the Claimants argue that this case is not relevant for the same reasons in respect of *Iberdrola* and *Malicorp, mutatis mutandis.202*\n\n*Malicorp* v. *Egypt,* RLA-10.\n\nReply, para. 228.\n\n*Iberdrola v.

Argentina objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis that the contract underlying the investment contained a forum-selection clause that precluded jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 treaty claims, including their claims for violation of Argentina\u2019s umbrella clause obligations. The Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s objection, citing among other reasons that the \"Claimants were not party to\" the agreement containing the forum-selection clause.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants aver that a contractual forum-selection clause cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over claims that Egypt has breached the Treaties. As the tribunal in *Total* v. *Argentina* observed, the distinction between treaty and contract claims \"would not prevent the Tribunal when dealing with the merits, from examining *incidenter tantum* whether there have been [contractual] breaches,\" should this be relevant to ascertain whether the State in question has committed the treaty breaches that the claimant alleged.205 In any event, the commitments that Egypt contravened, although reflected in part in the Source GSPA, were enshrined elsewhere though unilateral statements of government officials, government acts and the Treaties.206\n\n*Total S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic (\"Total S.A. v. Argentina\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 August 2006, CLA-125, para. 85 (footnote 50). See also Stephen M.

Schwebel,* Cambridge University Press, 1994, p.425, CLA-151.\n\nReply, para. 238.\n\n248.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that their treaty claims do no depend on any other tribunal\u2019s decision: as many cases have confirmed, the legality of an act under the relevant contract is not dispositive of that act\u2019s legality under international law.207 The Claimants submit that\n\n*[t]he only claim that relies on whether the Source GSPA has been breached is the part of the Claimants\u2019 umbrella clause claim specifically relying on the Source GSPA as an obligation binding on Egypt. For that claim, as in all others made by the Claimants to which any contract may be relevant, whether the* *contract has been breached under its governing English law is a question of fact for this Tribunal, which it has jurisdiction to decide as a fact. The question of international law is whether such a fact would then give rise to a breach of the umbrella clause.208*\n\nReply, para. 320.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n249.\n\nEssentially, as was seen above, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Gas Supply Dispute falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the CRCICA Tribunal which has upheld its jurisdiction.\n\n250.\n\nThe CRCICA Tribunal, avers the Respondent, is considering the same issues \"which the Claimants seek to disguise as violations of the Treaties in these proceedings.\"\n\n251.\n\nSince the Gas Supply Dispute \"is purely contractual in nature\", the Respondent concludes that it falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause in Article VII of the US-Egypt Treaty.\n\n252.\n\nIn response, as noted above, the Claimants assert that all of their claims in the present arbitration are based on their contention that Egypt has breached the US-Egypt Treaty and international law.\n\n253.\n\nQuoting from the Decision on Annulment of the Vivendi Committee, the Claimants say *\"[i]t is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction... and another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law.\"209*\n\n*Aguas del Aconquija* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, CLA-85, para. 105.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants claim breaches of various standards under the Treaty in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute, including fair and equitable treatment, unlawful expropriation and breach of the umbrella clause. As to the first two standards, the Tribunal accepts that, in order for it to find that there has been a breach of those standards in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute, it will need to determine as an incidental question whether the Source GSPA was validly terminated. However, this does not change the fact that the key issue under the Treaty in respect of a claim for unlawful expropriation or breach of the fair and equitable treatment is whether there has been a loss of property right constituted by the contract or whether legitimate expectations arose under the contract.\n\n256.\n\nAs to the umbrella clause, the Tribunal notes that there is no umbrella clause in the US Treaty and that it is invoked by the Claimants as having been introduced on the basis of the MFN clause in the Treaty. For purposes of its present decision on jurisdiction, the Tribunal need not determine today whether it has jurisdiction over such a clause. In due course, the question may become otiose.\n\n257.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Claimants\u2019 Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the standards of fair and equitable treatment and unlawful expropriation is dismissed. The Tribunal remains seized of the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Claimants\u2019 Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the umbrella clause.\n\n**E. Ratione Materiae Competence over the Tax Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione personae* over Mr. David Fischer, the Tribunal need not summarize the parties\u2019 arguments specific to the Germany Treaty.\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Claimants claim compensation in the amount of US$ 180.7 million for purported losses resulting from a taxation measure enacted by Egypt in 2008 (the **\"Tax Claims\").**210\n\nFTI Letter, 11 August 2014, Appendix 4.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tax Claims can be summarized as follows:\n\n(i) In 1997, the Egyptian Parliament passed the Investment Guarantees and Incentives Law No. 8/1997211. The Investment Law contains in its Chapter 3 a sub-statute establishing the so-called free-zones regime (the **\"Free Zones Regime\").** In accordance with the Free Zones Regime, companies benefiting from the free-zone status are treated as \"offshore\" for taxation and customs purposes, i.e. they are exempt from almost all taxes and customs duties.212\n\n(ii) EMG was formed on 19 April 2000 as a Free Zones company and, therefore, was not subject to most taxes or customs.213\n\n(iii) Subsequently, in light of the economic conditions prevailing at the time, the Egyptian Parliament adopted Law No. 114/2008 **(\"Law No. 114/2008\")214** which amended the Investment Law by excluding companies such as EMG operating in certain sectors, including petroleum production and transportation, from the Free Zones privileges.215\n\n(iv) In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that, by enacting Law No. 114/2008, the Respondent breached the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to their alleged investment, and the applicable umbrella clauses, and constituted an unlawful expropriation under the Treaties.216\n\nRLA-257.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 239.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 240.\n\nC-61.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 241.\n\nMemorial, paras. 97-99, 215, 242 and 277.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tax Claims were a matter specifically excluded from the scope of standards of protection, and the arbitration agreement, in the US Treaty. As such, avers the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 Tax claims.217\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 243.\n\n262.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent argues the following:\n\n(i) Article XI of the US Treaty provides that:\n\n*With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investments of nationals or companies of the other Party.*  *Nevertheless, all matters relating to the taxation of nationals or companies of a Party, or their investments in the territories of the other Party* *or a subdivision thereof shall be excluded from this Treaty, except with regard to measures covered by Article III and the specific provisions of Article V.218* (Emphasis added by the Respondent)\n\n(ii) The Respondent contends that that Article XI is clear: it carves out of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *\"ail matters relating to taxation\",* with the exception of measures relating to Article III (Expropriation) and Article V (Transfers) of that Treaty.219\n\n(iii) Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the claims of Ampal, EGI-Fund Investors, EGI-Series and BSS-EMG that Egypt\u2019s promulgation of Law No. 114/2008 is contrary to its commitments under the US Treaty to accord fair and equitable treatment to investments, and constitutes an unreasonable and discriminatory measure which is contrary to Egypt\u2019s obligation entered in regard to investments in its territory, are clearly excluded from the scope of that Treaty and are not subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.220\n\n(iv) The Respondent however concedes that the only tax claims that could fall within the scope of the US Treaty would be the Claimants\u2019 claim concerning \"measures covered by Article III\", i.e. a measure the effect of which is tantamount to an unlawful expropriation or nationalisation.221\n\nC-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 250.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 250.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 251.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the tax claims under the US Treaty.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Respondent agrees that Article XI of the Treaty does not carve out measures covered by Article III on expropriation. However, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal does not only have jurisdiction to determine whether Egypt\u2019s revocation of EMG\u2019s Free-Zone License violated Article III:\n\n*It also has jurisdiction to determine whether that conduct violated any of the other provisions of the US Treaty. Article XI* *of the US Treaty provides that \u2018all matters relating to taxation... shall be excluded from this Treaty, except with regard to measures covered by Article III. \u2019 To the extent a measure relating to taxation is covered by Article III \u2014 that is, constitutes an expropriation - the measure is not excluded from the Treaty. It is included within the scope of the Treaty, and all of the substantive protections in the treaty are applicable to it222*\n\nReply, para. 243. See *Enron* v. *Argentina,* RLA-142, paras. 65-66, where the tribunal interpreted a provision similar to Article XI of the US Treaty.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to consider the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction in respect of the Claimants\u2019 tax claims under the Germany-Egypt BIT as the Tribunal has found earlier that it lacked jurisdiction over Claimant David Fischer.\n\n266.\n\nArticle XI of the US-Egypt BIT is crystal clear. It says what it says that \"*all matters relating to the taxation* *of nationals or companies of a Party, or their investment in the territories of the other Party or a submission thereof*  *shall be excluded from this treaty,*  *except with regard to measures covered by Article III...\"* (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis).\n\n267.\n\nThe Respondent says that this Article is a specific carve-out but recognizes that taxation measures tantamount to an unlawful expropriation are clawed back and are not excluded from the Treaty. The Tribunal agrees and therefore finds that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent\u2019s taxation measure was tantamount to an expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investment insofar as deprivation of property or rights might have occurred.\n\n268.\n\nWhether or not the scope to the exception to the carve out for measures relating to expropriation encompasses other obligations in the Treaty in virtue of the so-called \"Gateway Theory\" invoked by the Claimants is not an issue which the Tribunal needs to determine today.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal need not determine either today whether, when Egypt enacted Law 114 in 2008223 revoking EMG\u2019s free-zone status, it did so in the exercise of its regulatory powers. This is a matter which may arise during the liability phase of this arbitration having regard, in particular, to Decree No. 1020 of 2000 which granted EMG a tax exemption until 2025.\n\nC-61.\n\n270.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal dismisses this objection by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n**F.** Alleged Illegality of the **GSPA**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione personae* over Mr. David Fischer, the Tribunal need not summarize the parties\u2019 arguments specific to the Germany Treaty.\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimants describe their alleged \"investment\" as \"the Peace Pipeline project, including the physical pipeline and the business concerned with buying Egyptian natural gas, transporting it through the pipeline to Israel, and on-selling it to Israeli customers.\"224\n\nMemorial, para. 179.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 purported investment, as it was borne out of and procured in conditions of illegality and corruption, in contravention of Egyptian laws and regulations as well as basic principles of international public policy.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the requirement of legality is a condition for the jurisdiction of any tribunal constituted on the basis of an investment treaty. The Respondent avers that this was accepted by the Claimants.225 In support of its argument, the Respondent refers the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) ICSID decisions which confirm the general requirement of international law that investments be procured legally and in good faith;226 and\n\n(ii) the expert legal opinion of Professor Herv\u00e9 Ascencio concerning the consequences of the Claimants\u2019 illegal acts on the protection of their alleged investment under the applicable Treaties. Professor Ascencio remarks that the US Treaty contains a requirement that an investment be made in accordance with the host State\u2019s laws and regulations.227 This requirement is found implicitly at Article II(2).228 In any event, Professor Ascencio underlines that the absence of any express legality requirement in a treaty does not bar the prohibition, under general international law, against protecting investments obtained illegally.229\n\nSee Tr. Day 1, 146:23-147:2. Respondents\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 74-79. See *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L.* v. *Republic of El Salvador (\"Inceysa Vallisoletana* v. *El Salvador\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, RLA-6, paras. 247-248; *Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic ('Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, RLA-8, para. 100; *Hamester v. Ghana,* RLA-9, paras. 123-124; *Alasdair Ross* *Anderson et al* v. *Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. Arb.(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010, RLA-171, para. 58.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 80.\n\nArticle II(2) contains a general condition for legality of investments made prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force: *\"This Treaty shall also apply to investments by nationals or companies of either Party, made prior to the entering into force of this Treaty and accepted in accordance with the respective prevailing legislation of either party.\"* Professor Ascencio remarks at para. 25 of his opinion that *\"such a provision could be interpreted a fortiori: since past investments must comply with the legality requirement, so must subsequent investments.\"*\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 88. Expert Legal Opinion of Herv\u00e9 Ascensio, 26 September 2013, para. 29.\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimants\u2019 purported investment is illegal since it was procured through connivance between the principal founders of EMG, Hussein Salem and Yosef Maiman, and certain Egyptian Government officials.\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that in October 1999, Mr. Sameh Fahmy left his position as Vice-Chairman of the company MIDOR founded by Messrs. Salem and Maiman, to become Egypt\u2019s Minister of Petroleum. The Respondent argues that Messrs. Salem and Maiman used their connection with Mr. Fahmy to have their newly founded company EMG directly selected in April 2000 to purchase gas from EGPC for resale to customers in Israel without any competitive tender process being organised. In this regard, Mr. Salem\u2019s long-standing relationship with Mr. Mubarak, then Egypt\u2019s President, could only have been of assistance. In other proceedings, Mr. Mohamed Tawila, who signed the GSPA as Chairman of EGAS, testified that the *\"friendship\"* between Mr. Fahmy and Mr. Salem enabled the selection of EMG, and that *\"as soon as Engineer Sameh Fahmy joined [the Ministry of Petroleum], he considered exports and,* *less than a year thereafter, Hussein Salem was informed that it is him who will export [gas]\"230.*\n\nMinutes of the questioning of Mohamed Ibrahim Youssef Tawila (R-852). Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 39.\n\n277.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, at the hearing, the Claimants sought to deny Mr. Fahmy\u2019s role in the direct selection of EMG for the GSPA in April 2000 arguing that the GSPA was a \"sui generis project\" approved \"at the highest levels\" of the Egyptian Government.231 The Respondent argues that this argument merely reinforces the improper relationships between EMG and key players in the former Egyptian Government.232\n\nSee Tr. Day 1, 150:2-10, 142:8-16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 39.\n\n278.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent submits that EMG\u2019s forgery of the Minutes of the Meeting of EMG dated 2 November 2009233 clearly shows that the GSPA was procured and concluded through corruption.\n\nSee R-965 (the original minutes) and R-966 (the alleged forged minutes).\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent highlights the major differences between the two versions of the minutes as shown in track changes below:\n\n*Mr. Abdel Hamid Hamdy thanked the Board and stated that without the good relation between the shareholders and the full support of Mr. Hussein Salem who was always supporting us and paying the order with the shareholders which led that our negotiation with the Government is fruitful and that he was they were always brainstorming ideas to us which concluded all the amendment we achieved and as well Mr.* *Abdel Hamid Hamdy thanked Merhav Group for their support during such period and thanked Ms. Ellen Havdala for all her support as well.*\n\n*~~Mr. Hamdy thanked the Board for their initiative regarding the above mention bonus which is on top of the generous bonus Mr. Hussein Salem gave to EMG team from his personal account which is very much appreciated (Mr. Hamdy pressed that the bonus they receive from Mr. Salem is way above the said bonus and he is amounting such to eliminate any misunderstanding in the future).~~*234\n\nRespondent\u2019s submission of 2 November 2015, para. 12.\n\n280.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this forgery was made to conceal the fact that (i) Hussein Salem was directly involved in the operation and management of EMG until at least 2009 and played a key role \"supporting [EMG] and paving the road\" for EMG to facilitate its negotiation of the First Amendment; and that (ii) Hussein Salem paid \"a generous bonus\" to EMG\u2019s personnel, Messrs Hamdy and Sakka, \"from his personal account\", following the conclusion of the First Amendment.235\n\nRespondent\u2019s submission of 2 November 2015, para. 26.\n\n281.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"EMG\u2019s alteration of the Minutes to remove all references to Hussein Salem\u2019s continuing close involvement in EMG and to the significant bonuses he paid to Mr. Hamdy and Mr. A1 Sakka demonstrates EMG\u2019s efforts to conceal the web of corruption that surrounds the GSPA.\"236\n\nRespondent\u2019s submission of 2 November 2015, para. 27.\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the selection of EMG for the purchase of Egyptian gas from EGPC and its exportation, as well as the subsequent conclusion of the GSPA without the organisation of any public tender process was in violation of:\n\n(i) Article 4 of EGPC\u2019s Commercial Activity Regulation;237 and\n\n(ii) Article 115 of the Egyptian Criminal Code.238\n\nSee R-l 1. Article provides that : *\"Exportation of crude oil, petroleum products, petrochemicals and natural and liquefied gas cannot be carried out by direct agreement except in case of necessity, at appropriate prices and based on a recommendation by the Deciding Committee and the approval of the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources.\"* The Respondent argues that those cumulative conditions were not met in the present case.\n\nSee RLA-98. Article 115 provides that : *\"Temporary hard labour shall be the punishment inflicted on each public official who obtains or tries to obtain for himself or for a third party, without due right, a profit or benefit from an act of office.\"*\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, as explained by Professor Ahmed Belal in his expert legal opinion, Mr. Fahmy\u2019s involvement in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum in the selection of EMG for the conclusion of the GSPA constituted a crime of \"profiteering\" under Article 115 of the Egyptian Criminal Code. He opines that Mr. Fahmy obtained for EMG an undue benefit by selecting it for the conclusion of the GSPA (i) despite EMG\u2019s complete lack of expertise in the transportation of gas, (ii) at a price that was highly imbalanced compared to EMG\u2019s profit from the sale of gas to IEC, its main Israeli On-Sale Customer239, and (iii) without organising a tender process, in order to preclude any more lucrative bids from more experienced competitors.240\n\nThe Respondent submits that under the Source GSPA, EGPC and EGAS, whose relevant costs included the exploration, production, development, processing and transport of natural gas to the Delivery Point close to the Egyptian-Israeli border in Al-Arish, were to receive a price ranging between US$ 0.75 and 1.50 per MMBTU *(See* Annex 5 to the GSPA (non-consolidated version), C-99). EMG, by comparison, was to receive US$ 1.25 per MMBTU merely for transporting the gas from Al-Arish to its Israeli customers, that is, simply for acting as an intermediary *(see* IEC On-Sale Agreement (Exhibit 23 to FTI Expert Report), Annex 4, paragraph 1).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 97-98. Expert Legal Opinion of Professor Ahmed Awad Belal (\"Belal Expert Legal Opinion\"), 26 September 2013, Part 1.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent also recalls that, at the time of the conclusion of the GSPA, Mr. Ibrahim Tawila241 was Chairman of EGAS. Mr. Tawila signed the GSPA on 13 June 2005 barely a month before departing EGAS to join EMG242, where, *inter alia,* he would be paid a salary several times higher than at EGAS243 and would receive a large bonus.244\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Mr. Tawila is now imprisoned in Egypt based on politically-motivated charges related to the EMG project. See footnote 35 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial *in fine.*\n\nSee C-10 and R-403.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 99. Mr. Tawila received at EGM a monthly salary amounting to US$ 20,830, an amount that is undoubtedly much higher than that which an EGAS official would receive. See R-896.\n\nRejoinder, para. 33. See R-403.\n\n285.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Mr. Hamdy\u2019s statement at the hearing that EMG offered to engage Mr. Tawila in July 2005, after he signed the GSPA on behalf of EGAS245, does not withstand scrutiny: Mr. Hamdy admitted that he was not involved in EMG\u2019s decision to engage Mr. Tawila246 and he did not know when or through whom EMG approached Mr. Tawila.247\n\nSee Tr. Day 5, 4:11-5:8.\n\nSee Tr. Day 5, 32:6-23.\n\nSee Tr. Day 5, 34:14-20. See Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40.\n\n286.\n\nIn respect of Mr. Tawila\u2019s salary, the Respondent contends that the Claimants failed without explanation to produce any evidence of the amounts EMG paid to Mr. Tawila between 2005 and 2008, in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s order that they be produced. At the hearing, Mr. Hamdy was unable to confirm how much or by whom Mr. Tawila was paid between 2005 and 20 0 8248 but speculated that he might have been paid by one of EMG\u2019s shareholders to an account outside of Egypt and in foreign currency.249 The Respondent argues that EMG\u2019s financial statement however make no mention of any payments to Mr. Tawila by EMG or its shareholders, as would be expected if the payments were legitimate.\n\nSee Tr. Day 5, 39:20-40:3; 52:2-5.\n\nSee Tr. Day 5, 49:18-25.\n\n287.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants\u2019 reliance on EMG\u2019s 7 August 2005 Extraordinary General Assembly Minutes250 as well as the 1 August 2005 letter from Mediterranean Gas Pipeline Company (\"MGPC\") to EMG251 to establish that MGPC, a shareholder of EMG, paid the salaries of a number of EMG employees, including Chairman Tawila, and reclaimed these amounts from EMG is unavailing. The Respondent contends that the Minutes refer to \"pre-operation expenses\" and do not mention salaries or other payments to personnel. As to the letter, it generally refers to \"salaries & compensations\" totalling US$ 1.8 million \"which has been paid and will be paid to various employees\", and does not evidence any salary paid to Mr. Tawila.252\n\nC-653.\n\nC-654.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent therefore requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences that Mr. Tawila joined EMG for a substantial benefit that he did not receive at EGAS.253\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, as confirmed by Professor Belal254, this can only be explained as a reward to Mr. Tawila for having signed the GSPA with an inexperienced company such as EMG, at a highly imbalanced price and without any tender process having been organised. Mr. Tawila\u2019s actions and their reward thus fall under the purview of the crime of bribery as defined by Article 103 of the Egyptian Criminal Code.255\n\nBelal Expert Legal Opinion, Part 2.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 100. Article 103 provides as follows: *\"Any public official who asks for himself or for a third party, or accepts or lakes a promise or a donation in order to perform any of his acts of office shad be considered a bribe-taker and shall be punished by life imprisonment and a fine of not less than one thousand pounds and not exceeding the donation or the promise he was given.\"*\n\n290.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that:\n\n(i) Given that the above-mentioned violations of Egyptian law were committed in relation to the conclusion of the GSPA, they render the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment illegal and outside of the Treaties\u2019 scope of protection.256\n\n(ii) This illegality affects all Claimants: *\"if the alleged investment was not lawful at the outset and thus was not protected under the Treaties when it was made, it cannot benefit from this protection simply because it was acquired by other entities later in time\".257*\n\n(iii) The Tribunal therefore has no jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims.258\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 101.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 103.\n\n291.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that allegations of corruption or bribery require clear and convincing evidence and that the Respondent has therefore not met its burden of proof, the Respondent answers that there exists no uniform standard of proof regarding allegations of corruption in international arbitration.259 Rather, tribunals have tailored the standard of proof to the particular circumstances of each case260 and have accepted circumstantial evidence as a means of proving allegations of corruption and bribery.261\n\n*See e.g.* *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan (\"Metal-Tech* v. *Uzbekistan\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, RIA-304, paras. 238-239.\n\nIn *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide* v. *Republic of the Philippines (\"Fraport v. Philippines\"),* for instance, the tribunal rejected the investor\u2019s arguments that, with respect to the respondent\u2019s allegation of illegality, \"the \u2018preponderance of evidence\u2019 test which applies in civil law must yield in the instant case to \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019\". *Fraport v. Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, CLA-155, para. 399. Similarly, the Tribunal in *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey (\"Libananco Holdings* v. *Turkey\")* rejected the \"contention that there should be a heightened standard of proof for allegations of \u2018fraud or other serious wrongdoing\", finding that the serious nature of these allegations \"does not necessarily entail a higher standard of proof\u2019. Arbitral tribunals have also accepted circumstantial evidence as a means of providing allegations of corruption and bribery. *Libananco Holdings v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, RLA-34, para. 125.\n\nRejoinder, para. 46.\n\n292.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 reliance on Egyptian court proceedings, the Respondent argues that this reliance in unavailing. The Tribunal has the inherent power to determine for itself whether the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment meets the requirements of legality for the purposes of the US Treaty, regardless of the findings of any Egyptian court.262 This is confirmed by arbitral case law submits the Respondent.263 In any event, the report prepared by the Committee of Five appointed by the Cairo Court in separate criminal proceedings against Mr. Mubarak is irrelevant to the Respondent\u2019s case concerning the illegality of the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment.264\n\nRejoinder, para. 52.\n\n*Inceysa Vallisoletana* v. *El Salvador,* RLA-6, paras. 209-210. *See also* *Fraport v.

Therefore, whether members of the former Egyptian government, among others, may have facilitated the procurement of the Claimants\u2019 alleged investment cannot preclude the Respondent from invoking Messrs Salem and Maiman\u2019s illicit acts. The relevant issues are: who is responsible for soliciting the corrupt acts, and who benefits from them. It was Messrs Salem and Maiman in both cases. If States were estopped from raising corruption defences in such circumstances, acts of corruption would never be sanctioned.265*\n\nRejoinder, para. 64.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s allegations of criminal wrongdoing by Mr. Fahmy and Mr. Tawila are not supported by any evidence. Such allegations say the Claimants require clear and convincing evidence.266 To the contrary, the documentary record demonstrates that they are false.\n\nReply, para. 250. *EDF (Services) Limited* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, para. 221: \"[t]he seriousness of the accusation of corruption... demands clear and convincing evidence\". See also *African Holding Company of America, Inc. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Construction au Congo S.A.R.L* v. *Democratic Republic of the Congo (\"African Holding Company* v. *DRC\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/21, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 29 July 2008, CLA-152, para. 55: \"[t]he governments of many respondents involved in international arbitration resort to allegations of corruption to prevent the Tribunal holding that it has jurisdiction or to influence its decision on the merits, which constitutes an additional reason why the standard of proof must, in this regard, be particularly high\".\n\n295.\n\nIn respect of Mr. Fahmy, the Claimants explain that, in October 2013, a Committee of Five was formed at the order of the Cairo Criminal Court in connection with the trial of Hosni Mubarak to scrutinize the negotiation and conclusion of the Source GSPA, including the circumstances surrounding the selection of EMG.267 The Committee confirmed that Mr. Fahmy was *not responsible* for the selection of EMG - a central element of Egypt\u2019s accusation of profiteering. Rather, the decision to select EMG to transport Egyptian gas to Israel was made at the highest levels of the Egyptian government, and communicated to Mr. Fahmy as a *fait accompli* to be implemented.\n\nReply, para. 254. See C-326.\n\n296.\n\nIn respect of Mr. Tawila, the Claimants recall that Mr. Hamdy and Mr. A1 Sakka both testified that they recommended to EMG\u2019s Board that it appoint Mr. Tawila after the Source GSPA had been signed.268 Therefore, the Claimants aver that Mr. Tawila could not have known that he would later be offered a position as Chairman of EMG when he signed the Source GSPA in June 2005.269 In addition, the Claimants explain that: (i) according to a decree of 29 May 2005, Mr. Tawila signed the Source GSPA because he was directed to do so by the Ministry of Petroleum in his capacity as EGAS Chairman and that he had no discretion in the matter.270\n\nSee Second Witness Statement of Abdel Hamid Ahmed Hamdy, 9 April 2014, paras. 58-59 and Second Witness Statement of Maamoun Al-Sakka, 9 April 2014, para. 118.\n\nReply, para. 257.\n\nReply, para. 258. C-29.\n\n297.\n\nIn respect of the Respondent\u2019s contention that its allegations of forgery of the Minutes of the Meeting of EMG dated 2 November 2009271 are directly relevant to the Respondent\u2019s claim that the GSPA was procured and concluded through corruption, the Claimants argue the following:\n\n*This is obviously wrong. The Source GSPA was concluded on 13 June 2005, more than four years before EMG\u2019s Board Meeting of 2 November 2009 took place and neither R-965 nor R-966 records anything about the procurement or conclusion of the Source GSPA. Even if Egypt\u2019s version of events were to be accepted, the alleged facilitation of the 2009 First Amendment and the alleged payment of bonuses to EMG\u2019s management in relation to the conclusion of those negotiations cannot be \"directly relevant\" to the negotiation and conclusion of the underlying agreement four years earlier, let alone the lawfulness of the Claimants\u2019 investments in the EMG project, all of which had been made by the time of the First Amendment negotiations.*\n\n*Egypt\u2019s attempt to link its allegations of forgery to a \u2018web of corruption \u2019 surrounding the Source GSPA is inconsistent with decisions by its own courts.272*\n\nSee R-965 (the original minutes) and R-966 (the alleged forged minutes).\n\nClaimants\u2019 submission of 30 November 2015, paras. 31 and 32. See North Cairo Criminal Court, 4th Circuit, in *Public Prosecution Case No. 1061 of 2011, New Cairo I Criminal Court (and No. 342 of 2011, East Cairo Plenary Prosecution)* v. *Amin Sameh Samir Amin Fahmy & Ors,* 21 February 2015, C-662, p. 21. See also North Cairo Criminal Court, 2nd Circuit, in *Public Prosecution Case No. 3642 of 2011, Kasr El-Nil Felonies, recorded under No. 157 of 2011, Cairo Downtown, Grand Instance v. Mohamed Hosni El-Sayed Mubarak & Ors,* 29 November 2014, C-663.\n\n298.\n\nFinally, in response to the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimants\u2019 investment was illegal because EMG was selected without a public tender, allegedly in contravention of EGPC\u2019s internal \"Commercial Activity Regulation\", the Claimants argue that this position is \"incredible\" given that (i) EGPC/EGAS were specifically authorized and instructed by the Egyptian Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Petroleum to enter into the Source GSPA,273 (ii) these authorizations were incorporated into the contract, (iii) Egypt\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court sanctioned these decisions as \"an act of sovereignty and a matter of Egyptian national security\",274 and (iv) this conclusion was confirmed by the Committee of Five. In addition, the Claimants aver that this argument was never put forward until the present dispute was well underway.275\n\nSource GSPA, R-225(A), Preamble.\n\nSee C-386.\n\nReply, paras. 259 and 260.\n\n299.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that (i) the Respondent cannot rely on the conduct of its own officials to deprive the Claimants of protection under the Treaties276, and (ii) Egypt represented that the Claimants\u2019 investment was valid.277\n\nReply, paras. 262-265. The Claimants submit that Egypt has made no accusation of any kind against any of the Claimants. In view of *Ioannis Kardassopoidos* v. *Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 July 2007, CLA-4, para. 179, Egypt\u2019s contentions about the misconduct of its own officials would have no effect on the Claimants\u2019 case say the Claimants.\n\nReply, paras. 266-273. The Claimants submit that the Egyptian authorities issued all the permits necessary for the construction of the Claimants\u2019 pipeline. Even when EGPC/EGAS sought to terminate the Source GSPA in April 2012, they did not suggest any illegality. As a result of this conduct, the Claimants aver that Egypt is now estopped from asserting that the Claimants\u2019 investment was illegal since representations that a contract is valid by entities empowered to exercise governmental authority create a legitimate expectation on the part of the investor that those agreements are valid. See *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Award on the Merits, 20 May 1992, CI.A-189, para. 81, where the tribunal rejected Egypt\u2019s argument that the acts of Egyptian officials upon which the investor had relied were in fact \"legally non-existent or absolutely null and void\" under Egyptian law.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, if it accepts the Respondent\u2019s argument in respect of the alleged illegality of the GSPA, the Claimants\u2019 entire case would fall.\n\n301.\n\nIt is a well-established principle of international law that a tribunal constituted on the basis of an investment treaty has no jurisdiction over a claimant\u2019s investment which was made illegally in violation of the laws and regulations of the Contracting State.\n\n302.\n\nAs set out above, in the instant case, the Respondent avers, *inter alia,* that Messrs Fahmy and Tawila who were instrumental in the selection of EMG for the GSPA in April 2000, were guilty, respectively, of \"profiteering\" and \"bribery\" in contravention of provisions of the Egyptian Criminal Code and since Messrs Salem and Maiman benefited from these \"corrupt acts\", the Claimants\u2019 investment was thus procured illegally.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s submission that, where there are allegations of corruption, fraud or other such serious wrongdoing in arbitration proceedings, arbitral tribunals should not apply a higher standard of proof than the preponderance of evidence standard, and that circumstantial evidence may be taken into consideration.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the Claimants\u2019 submission that the Tribunal should apply a higher standard of proof to those types of allegations, namely clear and convincing evidence.\n\n305.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, this is a complex question which has seen different investment tribunals apply different standards of evidence in such cases.278 However, whatever standard is applied, in all cases, the tribunals have concluded that they needed to be satisfied that, after having taken into account all of the evidence presented, the burden of proof had been met.\n\nSee *inter alia,* *EDF (Services) Limited* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, RLA-170, para. 221; *African Holding Company v. DRC,* CLA-152, para. 55; and *Fraport* v. *Philippines,* CLA-155, para. 399; *Libananco Holdings v. Turkey,* RLA-34, para. 125; *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan,* RLA-304, paras. 238-239.\n\n306.\n\nIn the present case, whether the Tribunal applies a high standard of clear and convincing evidence or even a less demanding one or a combination thereof, in the circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimants\u2019 investment was procured illegally. The Respondent\u2019s allegations are all based on innuendos. In sum, the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof.\n\n307.\n\nIn dismissing this facet of Respondent\u2019s objection to its jurisdiction, the Tribunal has taken into consideration the evidence in the record that the decision in Egypt to select EMG to sell and transport gas to Israel was made at the highest level of the Egyptian government and that, pursuant to that decision: (i) EGPC/EGAS were specifically authorized and instructed by the Egyptian Council of Ministers and the Ministry of Petroleum to enter into the Source GSPA, (ii) these authorizations were incorporated into the contract, (iii) Egypt\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court sanctioned these decisions as \"an act of sovereignty and a matter of Egyptian national security\", and (iv) this conclusion was confirmed by the Committee of Five. Moreover, the Cairo Criminal Court has also examined the contractual and factual matrix of the alleged illegality of the GSPA in the light of the Egyptian Criminal Code and concluded that there was no evidence of corruption.279\n\nC-662 and C-663.\n\n308.\n\nIn its submission of 2 November 2015 on what the Respondent avers is \"the impact on the Claimants\u2019 claims in this Arbitration\" of \"the forgery of the Minutes of EMG\u2019s 2 November 2009 Board Meeting\", the Respondent alleges that this evidence \"is directly relevant to [Egypt\u2019s] claim that the GSPA was procured and concluded through corruption.280\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions on Alleged Forgery of 2 November 2015 at paras. 25 and 57(v).\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimants deny this submission of the Respondent. They say *\"that obviously cannot be the case, when the Source GSPA was concluded more than four years before the EMG Board Meeting of 2 November 2009 took place and neither R-965 nor R-966 makes any reference to the procurement or conclusion of the Source GSPA\".281*\n\nClaimants\u2019 submission of 30 November 2015 at para. 11.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The two versions of the minutes of the EMG 2 November 2009 Board meeting have no impact whatsoever on the procurement and execution of the Source GSPA.\n\n311.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal resting on this ground is denied.\n\n**G.** Alleged Abuse of the Arbitral Process\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is widely acknowledged that (i) investment treaty tribunals have the inherent power to find that claims are inadmissible for abuses of process282, and (ii) that parties to a proceeding are bound by the principle of good faith.283 The Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 claims have been designed and submitted in bad faith and in complete abuse of the arbitral process.284\n\nSee *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008, RLA-161.\n\n*Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A.* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2, Award, 11 September 2009, RLA-169.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 254-256.\n\n*a)*  *Whether the Claimants improperly seek to multiply their chances of recovery*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent submits that EMG\u2019s shareholders are using multiple arbitrations to advance duplicative claims in respect of the same interest:\n\n(i) Mr. Maiman, the CEO of Ampal, the lead Claimant in these proceedings, confirmed his objective of maximising his chances of recovery, publicly announcing his intention to seek damages up to US$ 8 billion says the Respondent.285\n\n(ii) The Respondent contends that Mr. Maiman, a non-US national, restructured his interest in EMG to seek the protection of the US Treaty. The Respondent argues that following the signature of the GSPA on 13 June 2005, Mr. Maiman embarked on a strategic restructuring of his interest in EMG, which at the time was held entirely through his wholly-owned Israeli company, Merhav (mnf) Ltd. Based on the available evidence produced by the Claimants, this involved a series of coordinated transactions between Mr. Maiman\u2019s wholly-owned Merhav (mnf) Ltd. and two other Israeli companies under his control: Merhav-Ampal Energy Ltd. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Ampal, later called \"Merhav-Ampal Group Ltd.\") and Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings LP (a company formed in June 2007 as part of the reorganisation of Mr. Maiman\u2019s interest in EMG). According to the Respondent, as a result of these transactions, Ampal would hold the majority of its interest in EMG (amounting to a 12.5% indirect interest) through its Israeli subsidiaries Merhav-Ampal Energy Ltd. and Merhav-Ampal Energy Holdings. With this restructuring, Mr. Maiman sought the protection of his interest under the US Treaty, in view of Ampal\u2019s place of incorporation in New York, and notwithstanding that there was no US substantial interest involved says the Respondent.286\n\n(iii) The Respondent also contends that Mr. Maiman\u2019s engaged in insider transactions leading to Ampal\u2019s bankruptcy. The Respondent argues that the documentary record shows that Ampal was employed as a vehicle for Mr. Maiman\u2019s personal profit. Firstly, Mr. Maiman realised a personal gain of over US$25 million in connection with the restructuring of his interest in EMG.287 Secondly, Ampal paid to Mr. Maiman\u2019s Merhav (mnf) Ltd. a total of 31.8% of its outstanding shares without receiving any cash consideration in return.288 Thirdly, through his position as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Ampal, Mr. Maiman paid himself a salary of over US$ 3 million in 2010 and nearly US$2 million in 2011.289 Fourthly, Ampal\u2019s debt is significant: when it filed for voluntary bankruptcy before the Unites States Bankruptcy Court on the Southern District of New York in August 2012, a few months after it started this arbitration, its outstanding debt to its bondholders amounted to approximately $230 million.290 As Ampal\u2019s CFO described in those proceedings, the company\u2019s claims against the Respondent \"represent the only mechanism by which Ampal can recover substantial funds that may be used to satisfy Ampal\u2019s creditors\".291 The bankruptcy proceeding was converted into a liquidation proceeding under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code says the Respondent.292\n\n(iv) The Respondent argues that Ampal advances its claim in this arbitration in respect of the exact same 12.5% indirect interest in EMG for which Ampal\u2019s 100% subsidiary, Merhav-Ampal Group Ltd and its 50% subsidiary, Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings, claim in the parallel Maiman arbitration.293 According to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 quantum experts, FTI, confirmed at the hearing that any compensation awarded to Ampal in this arbitration will be duplicative if any compensation awarded to Merhav-Ampal Group Ltd in the Maiman arbitration.294 The Respondent contends that the same is true of Ampal\u2019s 50% interest in Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings and that the Claimants\u2019 strategy constitutes an abuse of process.\n\n(v) The Respondent avers that there is no basis under the relevant treaties or international law to consider that Egypt has consented to be subject to multiple, duplicative derivative claims brought by different levels of holding companies in respect of the same alleged loss to the same underlying shareholding.295 Accepting the duplicative use of derivative claims would require the most extreme caution as it gives the Claimants duplicative chances to prevail and creates risks of treaty shopping, double recovery and inconsistent outcomes says the Respondent.296 Egypt cannot be considered to have consented to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the claim brought by Ampal in this arbitration concludes the Respondent.\n\n(vi) The Respondent contends that Ampal\u2019s decision to cause its subsidiaries Merhav-Ampal Group Ltd and Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings to make claims under the Egypt-Poland BIT in the Maiman arbitration - thus asserting that those interests have Polish nationality for the purpose of the claim - constitutes a waiver of Ampal\u2019s right to assert that the same 12.5% interest in EMG simultaneously has U.S. nationality and is protected, including being entitled to invoke arbitral jurisdiction, under the Egypt-US BIT.297\n\n(vii) The Respondent avers that in both this arbitration and in the Maiman arbitration, the Claimants advance claims which directly concern the performance and termination of the GSPA (\"Gas Supply Claims\") as breaches of the Treaties, while EMG is at the same time already engaged in two commercial arbitrations in which it asserts the exact same claims. According to the Respondent, the Claimants thus seek the same relief in relation to the Gas Supply Claims as that which EMG seeks in the commercial arbitrations.298 The Respondent argues that these contractual claims are within the exclusive competence of the CRCICA Tribunal constituted pursuant to the GSPA\u2019s arbitration clause which has issued an Award upholding jurisdiction.299 In response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that compensation granted to EMG in the contractual arbitrations might not \"ultimately find its way to the shareholders\" because \"EMG has significant debts to NBE, the National Bank of Egypt, and to the other creditors\"300, the Respondent argues that this contradicts the premise of the Claimants\u2019 damages claim, i.e. that EMG\u2019s losses are sustained by its shareholders in proportion to their interest in the company.301\n\n(viii) According to the Respondent, EMG and its shareholders seek to multiply their chances of recovery in respect of the same contractual dispute concerning the performance and termination of the GSPA. They have created a situation in which they need to persuade only 2 out of 12 arbitrators seized of the Gas Supply Claims. The Respondent submits that the Claimants have improperly sought to instrumentalise the system of international arbitration to achieve an unprecedented abuse of process, which the Tribunal should decline to permit as lacking jurisdiction and/or as inadmissible.302\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 272.

In addition, this company did not have any involvement in the local business of EMG, let alone the Egyptian gas sector.308\n\n(iii) In view of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione personae* over Mr. David Fischer, the Tribunal need not summarize the Respondent\u2019s arguments specific to him in connection with the present submission.\n\nSee Memorial, para. 88 and C-149.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 300. See Memorial, para. 89.\n\n317.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that:\n\n*[it] cannot be taken to have consented to disputes with investors who are so remotely connected to their alleged investment in Egypt. Article VII of the Egypt-US BIT allows for the submission to arbitration of a \"legal investment dispute \", defined in relevant part as \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by the Treaty with respect to an investment. [...] The dispute resolution provision in the [Treaty] thus confirm[s] that the Respondent consented only to arbitrate disputes with investors having a meaningful and active connection to an investment in its territory.309*\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 301.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n*a)*  *Whether the Claimants improperly seek to multiply their chances of recovery*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe Claimants submit that even if Egypt could show that it is possible as a matter of law for claims over which an ICSID tribunal has jurisdiction to be held \"inadmissible for abuses of process or other serious forms of misconduct\", which it has not, none of the three specific bases of inadmissibility advanced by Egypt has any merit.\n\n319.\n\nIn respect of Ampal\u2019s corporate restructuring, the Claimants argue that it is now well-established that it is legitimate to restructure a company to gain the protection of an investment treaty for future disputes.310 According to the Claimants, the relevant question therefore is whether Ampal acquired its interest in EMG before Egypt breached the obligations it owed under the US Treaty. The Claimants aver that Ampal had obtained its 12.5% interest in EMG by November 2006, before Egypt breached the US Treaty311. This is acknowledged by Egypt say the Claimants.312\n\nReply, para. 279.

See *Ronald S. Lauder* v. *The Czech Republic (\"Lauder* v. *Czech Republic\"),* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, RLA-133, para. 174.\n\nTr, Day 9, 16:6 - 17:8, Dr Juratowitch: \"We accept that there is this overlap in this case. The Claimants have made a representation that they are not seeking double recovery. That is something that enforcement courts and any agreement as to payment of an award, absent the use of enforcement proceedings, would no doubt take account of. And in those circumstances, the abuse is taken care of as much as the Claimants are able to, absent the Respondent\u2019s consent to consolidation. For the purposes of your Tribunal, the question before you is harm caused to Ampal, the entity before you, by wrongful conduct. In the Claimants\u2019 submission, your jurisdiction, and jurisdictional responsibility, is to decide how much harm that is, and to issue an award accordingly. If, in the fullness of time, an amount is paid to subsidiaries of Ampal that would result in a reflective gain to Ampal that would compensate it for its loss, then Ampal\u2019s representation would be invoked and it would not be entitled to those funds. But I emphasise that that is a condition that would be fulfilled upon payment. So staying this arbitration would not be a question of staying until the UNCITRAL tribunal had issued an award, because we have seen from the very first point on the very first day of the UNCITRAL case that the Respondent has made clear its intention with respect to the Dutch courts on that case. So it is payment that would be the relevant feature, rather than an award.\"  \n See also Tr. Day 9, 18:16-19; Day 1, 185:25-187:1.

The Claimants aver that interests held through up to six intermediaries have been held not to be too remote.335 In addition, although these entities hold minority interests, the Claimants argue that the Treaty\u2019s broad definition of \"investment\" do cover those interests, as other tribunals have held.336\n\nReply, para. 306.

The Tribunal ultimately held that it had no *ratione materiae* jurisdiction as the investor had made no contribution of money or assets, but was merely given a share so that a requirement under Bolivian law for a minimum of three shareholders was complied with: *ibid,* paras. 232 and 237.\n\n**3, Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal has set out above what the Respondent argues is a complete abuse by the Claimants of the arbitral process,\n\n*a)*  *Whether the Claimants improperly seek to multiply their chances of recovery*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the four parallel arbitration with, essentially, the same factual matrix, the same witnesses and many identical claims may look abusive. However, subject to one important qualification in paragraphs 330-333 below, having reviewed carefully all of the Respondent\u2019s grounds invoked in support of its submission that the Claimants are not acting in good faith, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the four arbitral proceedings collectively or individually amount to an abuse of process.\n\n329.\n\nIt is possible, as a jurisdictional matter, for different parties to pursue distinct claims in different fora seeking redress for loss allegedly suffered by each of them arising out of the same factual matrix. As a matter of general principle, contract claims are distinct from treaty claims.338 Further, in the absence of an agreement to consolidation, two treaty tribunals may each consider claims of separate investors, each of which holds distinct tranches of the same investment. None of the four arbitrations at issue here is, per se, an abuse. It may not be a desirable situation but it cannot be characterized as abusive especially when the Respondent has declined the Claimants\u2019 offers to consolidate the proceedings.339\n\n*Aguas del Aconquija* v, *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, (2002) 6 ICSID Rep 327, 3 July, 2002, RLA-136/ CLA-85.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding in this respect is without prejudice to those measures that it proposes to take set out in paras. 335-340 in the exercise of its powers of case management in order to mitigate the risk of inconsistent decisions between it and the other tribunals currently seised of related aspects of the overall dispute at the merits stage.\n\n330.\n\nHowever, there is one important exception to this finding of the Tribunal. It concerns the overlap of claims by Mr. Maiman in the present case and the UNCITRAL arbitration (the two treaty cases) for the recovery of the same sum.\n\n331.\n\nIndeed, in the present arbitration, the Claimant Ampal, controlled by Mr. Yosef Maiman, advances its claims in respect of the same 12.5% indirect interest in EMG for which Ampal\u2019s 100% subsidiary, Merhav-Ampal Group Ltd **(MAGL)** (and its 50% subsidiary, Merhav-Ampal Energy Holdings) claim in the parallel Maiman arbitration (together the **\"MAGL portion\").** This is tantamount to double pursuit of the same claim in respect of the same interest.340 In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, while the same party in interest might reasonably seek to protect its claim in two fora where the jurisdiction of each tribunal is unclear, once jurisdiction is otherwise confirmed, it would crystallize in an abuse of process for in substance the same claim is to be pursued on the merits before two tribunals. However, the Tribunal wishes to make it very clear that this resulting abuse of process is in no way tainted by bad faith on the part of the Claimants as alleged by the Respondent. It is merely the result of the factual situation that would arise were two claims to be pursued before different investment tribunals in respect of the same tranche of the same investment.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, paras. 7.1.5 - 7.1.7; *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB/(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, para. 7.40.\n\n332.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, the Tribunal was provided with a copy of a letter from the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the *Maiman* arbitration, in which the Tribunal in those proceedings informed the parties therein that \"the Tribunal has now decided that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae.* The Tribunal will provide reasons for this decision subsequently, in its Award.\"341\n\nLetter dated November 18, 2015 from Tribunal to Parties in PCA Case No. 2012-26.\n\n333.\n\nThe consequence of this finding, together with the balance of the present Decision on Jurisdiction, is that the abuse of process constituted by the double pursuit of the MAGL portion of the claim in both proceedings must now be treated as having crystallised. Both Tribunals have confirmed that they have jurisdiction. It follows from this therefore that there is no risk of a denial of justice occasioned by the absence of a tribunal competent to determine the MAGL portion of the claim. Both Tribunals are seised of the merits and neither Tribunal has yet reached a decision on the merits.\n\n334.\n\nIt lies in the power of Ampal, as 100% owner of MAGL through Ampal Energy Ltd (Israel) to cure the abuse here identified were Ampal and MAGL to elect, in light of the present Decision which has otherwise confirmed the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, to submit the MAGL portion of the claim made in the *Maiman* arbitration to the exclusive jurisdiction of the present Tribunal, relinquishing that part of the claim in the *Maiman* arbitration, or conversely to pursue such claim only in the latter proceeding.\n\n335.\n\nArticle 26 of the ICSID Convention provides *\"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy\".*\n\n336.\n\nThe leading Commentary on the Convention observes.\n\n337.\n\n*Once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to seek relief in another forum, national or international, and are restricted to pursuing their claim through ICSID. This principle operates from the moment of valid consent.* 342 Decisions of ICSID tribunals and annulment committees are to like effect:\n\n*Article 26 represents one of the singular progressive advantages of the ICSID Convention. It 'create[s] a rule of priority vis-\u00e0-vis other systems of adjudication in order to avoid contradictory decisions and to preserve the principle of ne bis in idem. \u2019 Article 26 operates as a key element of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate confirming the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration as the means of dispute resolution, where the parties have agreed to such a forum for the resolution of their dispute.343*\n\nSchreuer et al., *THE*  *ICSID*  *CONVENTION:*  *A*  *COMMENTARY* (2nd ed., 2009), 351, RLA-14.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case no. ARB/05/19, Decision on Annulment, 14 June 2010 at para. 45.\n\n338.\n\nSuch an election would secure to Ampal in the present arbitration the advantages of the ICSID Convention, upon which it places special reliance, whilst removing the abuse constituted by the double pursuit of the same claim.344\n\nTr. Day 9, 11: 10-12.\n\n339.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal invites the Claimant Ampal to elect to pursue the MAGL portion of the claim in the present proceedings alone by 11 March 2016, or make its choice known at that time. The Tribunal will then revisit the question of abuse of process in relation to this portion of the claim in the light of its response.\n\n*b)*  *Whether indirect minority shareholders can bring claims*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to consider the parties\u2019 arguments in relation to Mr. David Fischer as the Tribunal has found earlier that it lacked jurisdiction over him.\n\n341.\n\nUnder the *chapeau* of its objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on an abuse of process by the Claimants, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should decline to arbitrate the claims of Claimants EGI-Fund investors and BSS-EMG Investors because they each have such minute interests in and \"too remote a connection\" with EMG and also because \"there is a need to set limits on such claims\".\n\n342.\n\nIn the case of Claimants EGI-Fund Investors and BSS-EMG Investors whose claims are based on the alleged breach of the US-Egypt Treaty, the answer to the Respondent\u2019s objection is found in Articles I(1)(c) and I(1)(d) of the Treaty which provide as follows:\n\n*(c) \"Investment\u2019\u2019 means every kind of asset*  *owned or controlled* *and includes but is not limited to:*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*(d) \"own or control\" includes ownership or control that is*  *direct or indirect, including* *ownership or control exercised through subsidiaries or affiliates.* (Tribunal\u2019s emphasis)\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal will not read into the Treaty restrictions such as those advanced by the Respondent to the effect that \"passive, indirect and very small\" holdings cannot enjoy any protection under the Egypt-US BIT.\n\n344.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over EGI-Fund Investors and BSS-EMG Investors are dismissed.\n\n345.\n\nThe Tribunal, accordingly, dismisses the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on an alleged abuse of process by the Claimants subject to Ampal's, cure of the abuse of process identified in paragraph 339 above.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n346.\n\nHaving carefully considered the parties\u2019 arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions, and having deliberated, for the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\na) To deny the Respondent\u2019s objections *ratione personae* in respect of Ampal, EGI-Fund and EGI-Series;\n\nb) To uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione personae* in respect of Mr. David Fischer;\n\nc) To declare that both the Centre (ICSID) and the Tribunal have no jurisdiction over Mr. David Fischer\u2019s claims in this arbitration by virtue of Articles 25(1) and 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention;\n\nd) To deny the Respondent\u2019s objection over the Claimants\u2019 Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the standards of fair and equitable treatment and unlawful expropriation;\n\ne) To remain seized of the Respondent\u2019s objection over the Claimants\u2019 Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the umbrella clause;\n\nf) To deny the Respondent\u2019s objection *ratione materiae* over the Claimants\u2019 tax claims;\n\ng) To deny the Respondent\u2019s objection in respect of the alleged illegality of the GSPA;\n\nh) To direct the Claimant Ampal to elect to pursue the MAGL portion of the claim in the present proceedings alone by 11 March 2016 or opt at that time for the pursuance of its claims in the alternative forum;\n\ni) To deny the Respondent\u2019s objection based on an alleged abuse of process by the Claimants subject to Ampal\u2019s compliance with para, (h) above; and\n\nj) To reserve its decision as to costs."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2017-02-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss\n---------------------------------------\n\n**I.

Therefore, the Tribunal sees no need to traverse again the procedural history of these proceedings, which it reviewed at length in its Decision on Jurisdiction. Initially, the Tribunal will recall its findings on jurisdiction, review the status of the parallel proceedings, and then set out the procedural history of the proceedings after the issuance of its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n4.\n\nIn order to set the stage for its decision on attribution and liability, the Tribunal will then review the background of the Claimants' investment in Egypt and the Respondent's alleged measures that, the Claimants say, breached provisions of the Treaty.\n\n5.\n\nThe Parties' requests for relief are set out in Section III. In its analysis, the Tribunal has considered not only the submissions of the Parties summarised in the present Decision, but also the numerous detailed arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral pleadings. To the extent that these arguments are not referred to expressly, they should be deemed to be subsumed into the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n**A. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 1 February 2016, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n7.\n\nThe operative part of the Decision provides as follows:\n\n*346. Having carefully considered the parties' arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions, and having deliberated, for the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:*\n\n*(a) To deny the Respondent's objections ratione personae in respect of Ampal, EGI-Fund and EGI-Series;*\n\n*(b) To uphold the Respondent's objection ratione personae in respect of Mr. David Fischer;*\n\n*(c) To declare that both the Centre (ICSID) and the Tribunal have no jurisdiction over Mr. David Fischer's claims in this arbitration by virtue of Articles 25(1) and 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention;*\n\n*(d) To deny the Respondent's objection over the Claimants' Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the standards of fair and equitable treatment and unlawful expropriation;*\n\n*(e) To remain seized of the Respondent's objection over the Claimants' Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the umbrella clause;*\n\n*(f) To deny the Respondent's objection ratione materiae over the Claimants' tax claims;*\n\n*(g) To deny the Respondent's objection in respect of the alleged illegality of the GSPA;*\n\n*(h) To direct the Claimant Ampal to elect to pursue the MAGL portion of the claim in the present proceedings alone by 11 March 2016 or opt at that time for the pursuance of its claims in the alternative forum;*\n\n*(i) To deny the Respondent's objection based on an alleged abuse of process by the Claimants subject to Ampal's compliance with para. (h) above; and*\n\n*(j) To reserve its decision as to costs.*\n\n**B. STATUS OF THE PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal recorded in its Decision on Jurisdiction that, in addition to the present arbitration, four other arbitrations between the same and/or related parties had been commenced.3 Of particular interest, the Tribunal noted that the Final Award in ICC Case 18215/GZ/MHM had been issued on 4 December 2015.4\n\nSee para. 10 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\nSee para. 12(ii) of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal invited the parties to provide comments on the relevance and impact of the ICC Award on the present case if any. The Respondent provided its comments on 17 February 2016 and the Claimants on 11 March 2016. The implications of the ICC Award on the present case are discussed below.5\n\nSee *infra*, sub-sections V, E, 2 (c) and (d), and sub-section V, E, 3 (d).\n\n10.\n\nAs of the date of issuance of the present Decision, no other award on the merits has been issued in any one of the other parallel proceedings.\n\n**C. HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF THE DECISION ONJURISDICTION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the issuance of the Decision of Jurisdiction and further to paragraph 346(h) of the Decision, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal in the following terms on 9 March 2016:\n\n*Ampal's preferred method of complying with the Tribunal's invitation would be to elect to pursue the claim for compensation arising from the portion of its interest in EMG held directly by Merhav Ampal Group Ltd (i.e., 8.21%) only in this proceeding, with Merhav Ampal Group Ltd withdrawing its entire claim in the UNCITRAL arbitration, but to leave Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings Limited Partnership to pursue its entire claim for its direct interest in EMG (8.58%) in the UNCITRAL arbitration, with Ampal withdrawing the part of its claim in this arbitration arising from the half of that 8.58% interest in EMG directly held by Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings Limited Partnership.*\n\n*This election would leave no claims being pursued in both fora in relation to the same shares in EMG, and thus no overlap between compensation sought in the two arbitrations. It would preserve the protection of the ICSID Convention for Ampal's interest in EMG held directly by Merhav Ampal Group Ltd, while avoiding difficulties that would otherwise be caused by seeking to withdraw 50% of the interest in Merhav Ampal Energy Holdings Limited Partnership's compensation claim from the UNCITRAL arbitration and leaving the remaining 50% of that same claim, which involves no overlap, to be adjudicated there, with any award in that arbitration in its favour to be payable to the Limited Partnership as a whole, but with only some of the holders of its equity being entitled to its benefit.*\n\n*As Ampal understands the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal's concern arises from the pursuit of compensation in relation to the same EMG shares in two different proceedings. This proposal would meet that concern. Ampal respectfully requests that the Tribunal confirm that such an election would be satisfactory to it. If it is, Ampal would remain at the Tribunal's disposal to provide any specification it may require as to the effect of this election on Ampal's claim for compensation in this proceeding.*\n\n*Before definitively making such an election, Ampal would need to obtain confirmation from the UNCITRAL tribunal that it has decided to dismiss all of Egypt's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. [\u2026][and] Ampal must receive approval from the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. [\u2026]*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*Ampal therefore respectfully requests that the deadline for making its election be extended until the UNCITRAL tribunal has indicated whether it has decided to dismiss all objections to jurisdiction and admissibility still pending before it and until Ampal has been able to obtain the requisite court approval for it to withdraw part of its claim in this arbitration and for Merhav Ampal Group Ltd to withdraw all of its claim before the UNCITRAL tribunal.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n12.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, the Tribunal granted the Claimants' request for an extension to make their election and directed the Claimants to provide the Tribunal, every 15 days, with updates on the developments in the related proceedings relevant to the Claimants' election, namely the Maiman arbitration and the proceedings before the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York.\n\n13.\n\nOn 21 March 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 7** rejecting the Respondent's request in its submission of 17 February 2016 to \"*[s]tay this proceeding pending the issuance of the Award in the [related] CRCICA Case No. 829/2012.*\"\n\n14.\n\nOn 5 May 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Tribunal and the Parties that the Secretary of the Tribunal, Ms. A\u00efssatou Diop, would be on leave as of 6 May 2016 and that Ms. Jara M\u00ednguez Almeida would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal during Ms. Diop's absence. Ms. Diop resumed her duties as Secretary of the Tribunal on 6 September 2016.\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 May 2016, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that, on 5 May 2016, the Maiman Tribunal had decided:\n\n*[\u2026] to dismiss all of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. Consequently, the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed in respect of the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility in accordance with Article 31(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.*\n\n*The full reasons for the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction and admissibility will be included in the Tribunal's Award.*\n\n16.\n\nOn 12 May 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were in the process of finalizing an agreed compendium of documents pertinent to liability, as requested by the Tribunal at the conclusion of the Hearing on 6 November 2014 and again on 7 December 2015. As the Parties could not agree the compendium, on 27 July 2016, the Tribunal directed the parties to submit simultaneously separate compendia. The Respondent filed its compendium on 15 August and the Claimants theirs on 16 August 2016.\n\n17.\n\nOn 16 June 2016, the Claimants filed with the Tribunal the decision of the United Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which confirmed their election.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimants' election on 20 June 2016, the Claimants responded on 28 June 2016, and the Respondent submitted further comments on 6 July 2016.\n\n19.\n\nOn 13 July 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8**, directing the Claimants to inform the Tribunal when their election was given effect in the UNCITRAL arbitration, admitting certain documents into the record, inviting the Claimants to comment on the admitted documents, and remaining seized of other requests made between the parties.\n\n20.\n\nOn 25 July 2016, the Claimants submitted an application to the Tribunal, requesting an \"*indicat[ion of] whether the election that Ampal has proposed would cure the abuse of process that the Tribunal found to have crystalized once both investment tribunals had found that they had jurisdiction*.\"6 The Tribunal ruled on 15 August 2016 that the Claimants' election would cure the abuse of process.\n\nClaimants' letter to the ICSID Tribunal dated 25 July 2016.\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 July 2016, the Claimants submitted their comments on the documents that were admitted into the record, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 8.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 August 2016, further to Procedural Order No. 8, the Claimants provided the Tribunal with a copy of their letter to the Maiman tribunal making their election before that tribunal:\n\n*The Claimants write respectfully to inform the Tribunal that Merhav Ampal Group Ltd (Merhav AGL) no longer seeks any compensation for the harm caused to it through its direct shareholding in EMG, as more specifically described in the attached 9 March 2016 letter from the claimants in the related ICSID arbitration to the ICSID tribunal.* *The purpose of this withdrawal is to eliminate any overlap in the compensation claimed in this and the related ICSID arbitration, now that both tribunals have confirmed their jurisdiction. The modification of the Claimants' claim to compensation is reflected in tabular form in the annex to this letter.*\n\n23.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent's compendium of documents relevant to liability, and the Resspondent responded on 9 September 2016.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Tribunal will now review the background to the Claimants' investment in Egypt and the measures of the Respondent that, the Claimants say, breached provisions of the Treaty.\n\n**A. BACKGROUND TO THE CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENT**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants' investment in Egypt has its origin in the 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt,7 which envisaged an inter-governmental commitment to energy interdependence between the two countries.\n\nPeace Treaty between Israel and Egypt (26 March 1979; in force on 25 April 1979), **C-11**, Agreed Minutes to Annex III, providing that normal economic relations will be established between the two States, which, according to the Agreed Minutes, includes \"normal commercial sales of oil by Egypt to Israel.\" *(Tribunal\u2019s emphasis*)\n\n26.\n\nEgypt's initial energy exports to Israel consisted of oil, but with discoveries of vast natural gas reserves, the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum embarked on a program to develop terms of agreements to produce and sell natural gas. These terms were eventually codified in various laws and regulations passed by the Egyptian Parliament in the late 1990s.8\n\nMemorial, paras. 15-16.\n\n27.\n\nTo carry out its gas sector policies, Egypt established the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (\"**EGAS**\") in 2001, a local holding company for natural gas wholly owned by the Egyptian government. The Ministry of Petroleum also formed GASCO, a subsidiary of EGAS, which would own the pipeline system to be constructed in Egypt.9\n\nMemorial, para. 17.\n\n28.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers decided in 2000 to set a uniform gas price, with a floor of US$0.75/MMBTU and a ceiling of US$1.25-1.50/MMBTU, at delivery point for gas exports from Egypt.10\n\nMemorial, para. 20. Egyptian Council of Ministers Resolution (the ***September 2000 CoM Resolution***), 18 September 2000, **C-23**. See also Letter from the Prime Minister of Egypt (A. Ebeid) to Chairman of East Gas, March 2001, **C-112**, (informing East Gas of the natural gas price set for FOB delivery at the Al-Arish delivery point).\n\n29.\n\nThe Israeli market was a prime target for Egyptian gas exports. As Egypt's capacity to export oil dwindled and new discoveries of natural gas were made, Israel began to develop its energy infrastructure, which would rely more on natural gas.11\n\nMemorial, para. 21.\n\n30.\n\nIndependent Israeli and Egyptian investors began discussing gas exports to Israel with the Egyptian government in the late 1990s. These discussions lead to the formation of the East Mediterranean Gas Company S.A.E. (\"**EMG**\").12 EMG's primary purpose was to purchase natural gas from Egypt and export it to Israel through a pipeline between Al-Arish in Egypt and Ashkelon in Israel.13 As a free-zone company, EMG benefitted from special status under Law 8/1997.14\n\nMemorial, para. 23. EMG's incorporation was authorized by Decree 230/2000 of the Egyptian General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (***GAFI***), GAFI Decree 1020/2000, and an Approval of the Prime Minister of Egypt dated 23 January 2000.\n\nMemorial, para. 23. EMG Bylaws, *Investment Gazette* 3381/2000, 28 May 2000, **C-15**, Second Article.\n\nMemorial, para. 45. See Law 8/1997, **C-17**, Articles 16-19.\n\n31.\n\nThe construction of a pipeline from Egypt to Israel was a capital-intensive project that required firm supply commitments from the Egyptian government. According to the Claimants, without such commitments, EMG would have been unable to secure financing for the pipeline or commitments from Israeli customers to purchase large quantities of gas on a long-term basis15, in particular from State-owned Israel Electric Corporation (\"**IEC**\").\n\nMemorial, para. 24.\n\n32.\n\nAs the Egyptian government maintained control of the country's hydrocarbon resources, EMG approached the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (\"**EGPC**\") with a view to purchasing gas directly at the source, rather than from private gas producers.16 EMG suggested to EGPC that it acquire a 10% stake in EMG. On 12 April 2000, EGPC's Board of Directors accepted both proposals. EGPC thus became a shareholder of EMG in April 2000.17\n\nSee Letter from EMG to EGPC, **C-113**, 2 April 2000.\n\nMemorial, para. 25. See Minutes of the Seventh Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, 12 April 2000, **C-20**.\n\n33.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the commitments of EGPC18 and other Egyptian governmental bodies19, including the Prime Minster and the Council of Ministers, were crucial to IEC's decision to contract with EMG for the initial purchase of 1.7 BCM annually.20\n\nEGPC wrote to IEC in May 2000 to confirm that EGM was the \u00ab Authorized Seller \u00bb of Egyptian gas to Israel. See Letter from EGPC (M. Tawila) to IEC (E. Landau), 24 May 2000, **C-21**.\n\nOn 31 May 2000, the Egyptian Embassy in Tel Aviv reiterated EGPC's commitment to IEC in a letter attaching a 12 April 2000 EGPC Board Resolution approving EGPC's commitment to the project. Letter from Egyptian Ambassador to Israel (M. Bassiouny) to IEC (E. Landau and Y. Dvir), 31 May 2000, **C-22**.\n\nMemorial, paras 26-28.\n\n34.\n\nEMG then commenced negotiations with EGPC for a long-term upstream supply contract. On 18 September 2000, the Egyptian Council of Ministers resolved that EGPC would sell up to 7 BCM of gas annually to EMG at a minimum price of US$0.75/MMBTU and a maximum price of US$1.25-1.50/MMBTU in accordance with the \"applicable international formula\" used by Egypt for gas export contracts.21\n\nMemorial, para. 30. See Egyptian Council of Ministers Resolution, 18 September 2000, **C-23**. (as incorporated into Source GSPA, **C-10**, Preamble, p. 8).\n\n35.\n\nOn 7 October 2000, EGPC and EMG signed a Preliminary Agreement for the sale of 7 BCM of natural gas per year.22 The Prime Minister of Egypt then wrote to EMG and confirmed Egypt's commitment to provide this quantity of natural gas at the decreed price.23\n\nPreliminary Agreement by and between the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and East Mediterranean Gas Company, 7 October 2000, **C-117**.\n\nMemorial, para. 32. See Letter from the Prime Minister of Egypt to EMG, 19 March 2001, **C-24** (as incorporated into Source GSPA, **C-10**, Preamble, p. 5).\n\n36.\n\nNegotiations were interrupted because of the Second Intifada, which commenced in September 2000. By 2003, the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum, Sameh Fahmy, expressed doubt as to the viability of Egypt's commitment.24\n\nMemorial, para. 33. See A. Cohen, \"Egyptian petroleum minister backtracks on Israeli gas deal,\" *Haaretz*, 3 June 2003, **C-118**.\n\n37.\n\nOn 9 September 2003, EMG asked the Egyptian government to resume negotiations and to reaffirm its commitment to the gas supply arrangement. The following day, the Chairman of EGPC wrote to IEC confirming the Egyptian gas supply commitments and reinitiating tripartite negotiations.25\n\nMemorial, para. 36. See Letter from EGPC (I. Mahmoud) to IEC (E. Landau), 10 September 2003, **C-25**.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 January 2004, the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum confirmed Egypt's commitment to supply EMG with 7 BCM annually for onward sale to Israeli customers, and instructed EGPC and EGAS to conclude a gas supply agreement with EMG in accordance with the framework of the September 2000 Council of Ministers Resolution.26\n\nMemorial, para. 37. See Ministry of Petroleum Resolution 100/2004, 26 January 2004, **C-26**.\n\n39.\n\nThe Egyptian and Israeli governments then exchanged drafts of an inter-State Memorandum of Understanding confirming Egypt's supply commitment and authorizing EGPC/EGAS to act as representatives of the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum in executing the Source GSPA and a tripartite agreement with EMG and IEC.27\n\nMemorial, para. 37. See Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of the State of Israel (Draft), 17 February 2004, **C-124**.\n\n40.\n\nOn 13 June 2005, EMG and EGPC/EGAS signed the Source GSPA and the Tripartite Agreement. Egypt and Israel executed the Memorandum of Understanding on 30 June 2005.28\n\nMemorial, para. 42.\n\n41.\n\nEMG and IEC signed an On-Sale Agreement on 8 August 2005 and the Tripartite Agreement on 28 August 2005. According to the Claimants, these agreements, together with the Source GSPA and the Memorandum of Understanding, formed a unit of intertwined commitments.29\n\nMemorial, para. 44.\n\n42.\n\nEMG also entered into ten additional downstream contracts with other Israeli customers in the industrial and power generation sectors.30 The Tribunal notes that EGPC/EGAS did not enter into additional Tripartite Agreements with EMG and its other Isreali customers.31\n\nMemorial, para. 56. For an illustration of these commitments, see the table at para. 56 of the Claimants' Memorial.\n\nMemorial, para. 59.\n\n**B. EGYPT'S ALLEGED MEASURES**\n-------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Egypt's following measures destroyed their investment.\n\n44.\n\nFirst, the Egyptian government revoked EMG's tax-exempt status by promulgating Law 114/2008 on 5 May 2008.32 As a result of this law, EMG's annual tax burden was increased from 1% of its revenues to 20%.33 Egypt's revocation of EMG's free-zone status not only increased the tax levied on EMG's revenues, say the Claimants, but also subjected EMG to taxes on assets and operations that were previously non-taxable. The revocation also obliged EMG to pay customs duties, sales taxes, and duties on equipment and machinery.34\n\nLaw 114/2008, *Official Journal*, Issue No. 18 (bis), 5 May 2008, **C-61**, Article 11.\n\nMemorial, para. 46. See Law 8/1997, 11 May 1997, **C-17**, Article 35.\n\nMemorial, para. 99. See Law 8/1997, 11 May 1997, **C-17**, Article 32 and 35.\n\n45.\n\nSecond, according to the Claimants, Egypt withheld gas from EMG in order to compel renegotiation of the Source GSPA and coerce the Claimants into signing the First Amendment.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants aver that, as EMG was set to begin receiving limited gas quantities in January 2008 during the First Commissioning Period when the pipeline was going to be tested,35 EGPC/EGAS notified EMG that they would have difficulty supplying the contractual quantities of gas necessary for testing, because Egypt had committed to supply more gas to various buyers than it could deliver.36\n\nLetter from EMG (M. Tawila) to EGPC (A. Taha) and EGAS (M. Amer), 4 December 2007, **C- 153** ; Letter from EMG (M. Tawila) to EGAS (M. Amer), 6 January 2008, **C-154**.\n\nMemorial, para. 92. See Minutes of Meetings between EMG, EGAS, and GASCO, 6 January 2008, **C-155**. See also Letter from EGAS (M. Amer) to EMG (M. Tawila), 8 January 2008, **C-55**.\n\n47.\n\nThroughout the spring of 2008, EGPC/EGAS continued to undersupply EMG, citing gas shortages in Egypt.37 These delays damaged EMG's credibility with IEC, say the Claimants.38\n\nLetter from EGAS (M. Amer) to EMG (M. Tawila), 15 March 2008, **C-46** ; Letter from EGAS (M. Amer) to EMG (M. Tawila), 27 March 2008, **C-47** ; Letter from EGAS (M. Amer) to EMG (M. Tawila), 16 April 2008, **C-48**.\n\nMemorial, para. 93.\n\n48.\n\nDuring the same period, the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum was informed by the Egyptian Attorney General that pressure groups and lawyers were complaining about Egypt's gas export practices.39 On 3 April 2008, EGPC/EGAS wrote to EMG demanding a price increase.40\n\nLetter from Attorney General (A. Mahmoud) to the Minister of Petroleum (S. Fahmy), 17 March 2008, **C-156**.\n\nMemorial, para. 94. See, e.g., Letter from EGPC (A. Taha) and EGAS (M. Amer) to EMG (M. Tawila), 3 April 2008, **C-51.**\n\n49.\n\nReluctantly, say the Claimants, EMG nevertheless entered into discussions with the Egyptian government to revise the Source GSPA.41\n\nMemorial, para. 96.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Mr. Zell, an EMG Board Member and the founder and chairman of EGI, represented EMG and the Claimants in the negotiations of the Source GSPA with the Egyptian government.42\n\nMemorial, para. 100.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, while Egypt was demanding renegotiation of the Source GSPA, it continued to withhold gas during the negotiations in order to coerce the Claimants into agreeing increased prices for reduced quantities of gas.\n\n52.\n\nCompelled to renegotiate, argue the Claimants, EMG made significant concessions43 and signed the First Amendment to the Source GSPA on 31 May 2009.\n\nMemorial, paras. 117 and 118. See **C-50** for the First Amendment.\n\n53.\n\nThird, according to the Claimants, even after the First Amendment was signed, Egypt continued to flout its supply obligations.\n\n54.\n\nIn 2010, EMG experienced delivery irregularities, which impacted its ability to reimburse its loan installments to NBE and to supply full contractual volumes to its customers. This prompted complaints by EMG's anchor buyer, IEC.44 At a December 2010 meeting in Cairo between EGPC/EGAS, EMG and IEC, the Claimants write, \"*EGPC/EGAS acknowledged that Egypt's inability to deliver full contractual quantities was due to production shortages in Egypt, which had resulted from the overextension of gas supply capabilities and mismanagement of upstream resources. EGPC/EGAS sought to assuage the concerns of EMG and IEC about the security of contractual volumes, laying out plans to develop new gas fields and to accelerate the development of delayed projects. EGPC/EGAS also confirmed their commitment to deliver extra gas to compensate for the substantial shortfalls that had accumulated since the start of delivery under the Source GSPA.*\"45\n\nMemorial, paras 119 and 121.\n\nMemorial, para. 126.\n\n55.\n\nFourth, according to the Claimants, while Egypt subjected EMG to severe supply shortfalls, it also failed to protect its Pipeline from attacks as the Arab Spring began.\n\n56.\n\nThe change of government in Egypt coincided with a series of attacks on the Egyptian pipeline system used to deliver gas to the EMG Pipeline. Some Egyptian politicians condoned the attacks that interrupted gas flow to Israel.46\n\nMemorial, para. 127. See **C-198**.\n\n57.\n\nAfter an attack on the Egyptian pipeline system on 5 February 2011, supply came to a halt. Although the system was eventually repaired, EMG never received its full contractual volumes, submit the Claimants. In the fourteen months between this first attack and the termination by EGPC/EGAS of the Source GSPA in April 2012, only two months of contracted quantities were delivered.47\n\nMemorial, para. 128. See FTI Report, para. 4.6.\n\n58.\n\nEgypt's delivery failures deprived EMG of its sole source of revenue and strained EMG's relationships with its customers. According to the Claimants, Egypt sought to exploit EMG by demanding yet again on 3 March 2011 changes to the quantity and price provisions of the Source GSPA.48\n\nMemorial, paras. 129-130. See **C-65**.\n\n59.\n\nAfter the first attack, according to the Claimants, Egypt took no concrete steps to protect its pipeline network until April 2012 when it announced that it was sending reinforcements49, notwithstanding EMG's complaints about the lack of security over the course of 2011.50 During those fourteen months between the first attack and April 2012, 14 attacks were carried out on the Egyptian pipeline system.51\n\nMemorial, para. 134.\n\nMemorial, para. 141.\n\nMemorial, para. 135.\n\n60.\n\nAfter an attack on 12 July 2011, EMG did not receive any gas for 99 days. During this period of non-delivery, EGAS/EGPC, on 24 August 2011, threatened to terminate the Source GSPA, alleging that EMG had failed to pay invoices for gas supply in early 2011.52 The Claimants aver that: \"*[t]he termination threat [\u2026] took no account of EGPC/EGAS\u2019s own non-performance, the partial payments that EMG had made on the invoices in question, or the fact that the alleged arrears on which the threat was based were counterbalanced by Shortfall Compensation in accordance with the Source GSPA.*\"53\n\nMemorial, paras. 141-142. See C-85.\n\nMemorial, para. 142.\n\n61.\n\nEMG paid the disputed invoices under protest. However, the NBE informed EMG on 5 September 2011 that it would not transfer US$14 million to EGAS unless EGPC/EGAS confirmed their intention to perform their obligations under the Source GSPA and to resume gas supplies.54 EGPC/EGAS refused and the funds remained frozen in EMG's account.55\n\nMemorial, para. 143. See **C-86**, **C-208**, and **C-209**.\n\nMemorial, para. 143. C-209.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants point out that while EMG received no gas due to an alleged state of *force majeure*, EGPC/EGAS continued to supply gas to Jordan. When the pipeline system was attacked again on 27 September 2011 \u2013 this time affecting gas flow to Jordan and other Arab customers \u2013 EGPC/EGAS reacted and repaired in less than one month damage far more serious than the damage caused by the 12 July 2011 attack that left EMG's Pipeline without gas for 99 days.56\n\nMemorial, para. 144. Al Sakka Witness Statement, para. 109.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, as EMG had received no gas at all in August or September 2011, minimal quantities in October and November, and again nothing in December, its financial position deteriorated.57\n\nMemorial, para. 147. See FTI Report, Appendix 8.\n\n64.\n\nDuring the first four months of 2012, EGPC/EGAS, invoking *force majeure*, either delivered no gas at all to EMG or sent minimal quantities averaging approximately 5.4% of contracted volumes.58\n\nMemorial, para. 148. See **C-215**.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants write that on 12 March 2012, Egypt's Parliament voted to expel Israel's Ambassador to Egypt and to put an end to gas exports to Israel.59 This vote followed a report by the Egyptian Parliament's Arab Affairs Committee declaring Israel to be Egypt's \"number one enemy\" and calling upon the Egyptian government \"to review all its relations and accords with that enemy.\"60 According to the Claimants, these statements demonstrate explicitly the discriminatory political motivation behind Egypt's treatment of the Claimants' investment.61\n\nMemorial, para. 149. See **C-217** and **C-88**.\n\n**C-88**.\n\nMemorial, para. 149.\n\n66.\n\nOn 19 April 2012, EGPC/EGAS sent EMG a notice of termination of the Source GSPA for alleged non-performance by EMG.62 EMG responded with a letter stating that the termination attempt was invalid and in bad faith, and that the notice should be withdrawn.63 On 9 May 2012, as it had no choice, write the Claimants, EMG accepted EGPC/EGAS's repudiation, terminated the Source GSPA, and elected to seek damages from EGPC and EGAS.64\n\nMemorial, para. 150. See C-92.\n\n**C-93**.\n\nMemorial, para. 150. See C-219; ICC arbitration 18215/GZ/MHM.\n\n67.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants submit that their investment has been destroyed because Egypt:\n\n(i) revoked EMG's tax-free status, further burdening EMG's finances and significantly lowering the value of the Claimants' investment;\n\n(ii) deliberately withheld contractual quantities from EMG in order to coerce price increases and attempt to decrease contractual quantities;\n\n(iii) overcommitted to supplying gas to third parties and failed to make sufficient quantities available to EMG for delivery to Israeli customers in breach of the State's supply obligations;\n\n(iv) failed to prevent sabotage of the pipeline system and then failed to ensure that its State entities repaired the resulting damage within a reasonable time, delivering no gas at all to EMG for months at a time; and\n\n(v) sought to make up contractual grounds in order to carry out government policy and put an end to all exports to Israel.65\n\nMemorial, paras. 151-157.\n\n**III. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n*(a)*  *DISMISS all of Egypt's objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims;*\n\n*(b)*  *DECLARE:*\n\n*(i)*  *that Egypt violated Article II(4) of the US Treaty (or Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty, applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), and customary international law by failing to accord the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment and impairing their investments through the adoption of unreasonable measures;*\n\n*(ii)*  *that Egypt violated Article II(4) of the US Treaty (or Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty, applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), and customary international law by engaging in arbitrary and discriminatory measures against the Claimants' investment because it was selling natural gas to Jews in Israel;*\n\n*(iii)*  *that Egypt has violated Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty (applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), and customary international law by failing to observe obligations it has entered into with regard to the Claimants' investments;*\n\n*(iv)*  *that Egypt has violated Article 2(2) of the UK Treaty (applicable to the US Claimants through Article II(1) of the US Treaty), and customary international law by failing to provide the Claimants and their investments with full protection and security; and*\n\n*(v)*  *that Egypt expropriated the Claimants' investments without payment of adequate and effective compensation, a public purpose, or due process of law in violation of Article III(1) of the US Treaty, and customary international law.*\n\n*(c)*  *ORDER Egypt to pay compensation to the Claimants of no less than US$ 635.0 million and, to the extent applicable, DECLARE that the sum awarded has been calculated net of Egyptian taxes;*\n\n*(d)*  *ORDER Egypt to pay pre- and post-award interest at Egypt's sovereign borrowing rate (as updated), compounded annually, accruing until payment is made in full;*\n\n*(e)*  *ORDER Egypt to indemnify the Claimants in full with respect to any Egyptian taxes imposed on the compensation awarded to the extent that such compensation has been calculated net of Egyptian taxes;*\n\n*(f)*  *ORDER Egypt to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the Claimants' reasonable legal and expert fees, and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal; and*\n\n*(g)*  *AWARD such other relief to the Claimants as the Tribunal considers appropriate.66*\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 637, as adjusted to remove David Fischer's claim and reduce Ampal's claim in accordance with its election.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAlthough the Claimants pleaded their case in a number of different ways, the Tribunal, in the light of its Decision on Jurisdiction and its analysis below of the law and evidence, formulates the issues that it is called upon to determine in this Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss as the following:\n\n(1) *Attribution.* To the extent that the Claimants rely on the acts or omissions of EGPC or EGAS as engaging the responsibility of the Respondent under the Egypt-US BIT, to what extent are the actions of EGPC or EGAS attributable to the Respondent as a matter of international law (V)?\n\n(2) *Revocation of tax exemption to 2025.* Was the Respondent's revocation by Law 114 of 2008 of the tax exemption granted to EMG by Decree No. 1020 of 2000 until 2025 a measure \"tantamount to expropriation\" of the Claimants' investment under Article III of the Egypt-US BIT giving rise to the Respondent's obligation to compensate the Claimants for the fair market value of the expropriated investment (VI B)?\n\n(3) *Revocation of tax exemption after 2025.* Does such revocation give rise to a claim for breach of Article III beyond 2025 (being the date of expiry of the licence for tax exemption granted to EMG by Decree No. 1020) (VI C)?\n\n(4) *Execution of First Amendment.* As a matter of fact, was the execution of the First Amendment to the GSPA on 31 May 2009 procured by the Respondent's coercion of EMG, so as to be capable of giving rise to a separate claim by the Claimants of breach of treaty (VI D)?\n\n(5) *Delivery shortfall until January 2011.* Does the alleged shortfall in deliveries of gas under the GSPA from July 2009 until January 2011 (prior to the attacks on the Pipeline) constitute a breach of the Claimants' treaty rights by the Respondent (VI E 1)?\n\n(6) *Protection of Pipeline February 2011\u2013May 2012.* Did the Respondent breach Article II 4 of the Egypt-US BIT by failing to exercise due diligence in the protection and security of the Claimants' investment as required by international law in response to the attacks on the Pipeline between 5 February 2011 (the date of the first attack) and 9 May 2012, the date on which EMG accepted EGAS's repudiation of the GSPA (VI E 2)?\n\n(7) *Termination of the GSPA.* Did the Respondent expropriate the Claimants' investment in EMG when EGAS terminated the GSPA with effect from 9 May 2012 (VI E 3)?\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with each of these issues in turn.\n\n**V. ATTRIBUTION**\n------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION : THE RELEVANCE OF ATTRIBUTION**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal turns first to the issue of attribution. This issue only arises to the extent that the Claimants advance claims against the Respondent of breach of treaty in reliance upon the actions or omissions of EGPC/EGAS, such that it is necessary to determine whether and, if so, to what extent, the actions of those bodies are attributable to Egypt as a matter of international law.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants are of the view that there is no issue of attribution in respect of most of the Respondent's actions. Egypt's arguments concerning attribution are raised only with respect to the actions of EGPC and EGAS in the context of the Source GSPA. The Claimants say that attribution is an issue only with respect to one facet of the Claimants' third head of compensation: the gas supply failures.68\n\nClaimants' Skeleton, paras. 30-31.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, argues that it is not responsible for EGPC and EGAS's contractual obligations. The Respondent starts from the premise that the Claimants, being unable to find any agreement concluded between the Respondent and EMG, distort the principles of international law by submitting that contractual obligations undertaken by EGPC and EGAS should be \"attributed\" to the Respondent. The Respondent argues that this is unavailing.69\n\nRejoinder, para. 351.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent points out that neither the GSPA, the Tripartite Agreement nor the MoU were contracts between the Respondent and EMG:\n\n(i) The Respondent was not a party to the GSPA;70\n\n(ii) The Respondent was not a party to the Tripartite Agreement \u2013 the Tripartite Agreement only created obligations for EGPC and EGAS vis-\u00e0-vis IEC, not EMG;71\n\n(iii) EMG was not a party to the Egypt-Israel MoU \u2013 the fact that EGPC, EGAS and EMG decided to include a copy of the MoU as a schedule to the GSPA does not have any legal effect.72\n\nRejoinder, paras. 353-354.\n\nRejoinder, para. 355. See **C-30** for the Tripartite Agreement.\n\nRejoinder, para. 356. See **C-31** for the MoU.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimants cannot invoke the rules of attribution in order to create contractual obligations for the Respondent.\n\n76.\n\nThe rules of attribution, says the Respondent, apply specifically to conduct which is internationally wrongful not to the undertaking of obligations.73 The inapplicability of the rules of attribution to international obligations of States is highlighted in the following paragraph of the ILC Commentary74:\n\n*The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations,* *the breach of which gives rise to responsibility. This is the function of the primary* *rules, whose codification would involve restating most of substantive customary and conventional international law.75*\n\nRejoinder, para. 358\n\nRejoinder, para. 363.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, (2001), II (Part Two) *Yearbook of the International Law Commission* 31, **RLA-255**, General Comments 1-4 (emphasis added).\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the rules of attribution are *a fortiori* inapplicable to contractual obligations. According to Egypt, it is well settled that the rules of attribution do not determine whether or not a contract entered into by a separate entity binds a State.76 In support of its argument, the Respondent refers, *inter alia*, to the award in *EDF (Services)* v. *Romania* :\n\n*[T]he attribution to Respondent of AIBO's and TAROM's acts and conduct does not render the State directly bound by the ASRO Contract or the SKY Contract for purposes of the umbrella clause. [\u2026] Attribution does not change the extent and content of the obligations arising under the ASRO Contract and the SKY Contract, that remain contractual, nor does it make Romania party to such contracts.77*\n\nRejoinder, para. 364.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania (\"EDF (Services) v. Romania\"* or *\"EDF\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, **RLA-71**, paras. 318-319.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it thus follows that \"*the characterisation of the contracting party as organ of the State under the ILC Articles is wholly irrelevant when it comes to determining whether a State is bound by a contract. What is relevant is whether the State itself has entered into the contract.*\"78 The Respondent submits that many arbitral tribunals have confirmed the inapplicability of the rules of attribution to contractual obligations undertaken by entities having a separate legal personality has been confirmed by many arbitral tribunals.79\n\nRejoinder, para. 368.\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

Ukraine*, SCC Case No. 080/2005 (ECT), Final Award, 26 March 2008, **RLA-24**, paras. 110-112.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal makes two preliminary observations with regard to the issues in the present arbitration to which the international law rules of attribution are relevant.\n\n80.\n\nFirst, the question of attribution here is only engaged in relation to the claim of expropriation arising from the termination of the GSPA and the resulting failure to supply gas to the Claimants issue (7):\n\n(a) The claims in relation to the revocation of EMG tax-free status (issues (2) and (3) above) depend upon decisions of the Respondent itself, not EGPC or EGAS;\n\n(b) In considering the claim in relation to the execution of the First Amendment, it is first necessary to decide on the facts whether the Claimants' plea of coercion is made out on the facts (issue (4)). Whether or not any acts of EGPC or EGAS in relation to the First Amendment are attributable to the Respondent will be academic unless the factual predicate for the Claimants' claim is made out;\n\n(c) A determination of attribution in relation to alleged delivery shortfalls prior to the attacks on the pipeline (issue (5)) would only arise in the event that the Tribunal finds that this claim is capable of constituting a breach of treaty and not merely a breach of contract. So it is first necessary to characterise the nature of this claim; and,\n\n(d) The claim for failure to protect the Pipeline from attack (issue (6)) is a claim of direct responsibility on the part of the Respondent State and does not depend upon the attribution of acts or omissions of EGPC/EGAS.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that the rules of attribution only apply to the determination of breaches of international law. They are not applicable to contractual breaches. As it has already held in paragraphs 254-5 of its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal only has jurisdiction in the present case over breaches of the Treaty under international law. In that context, it observed that:\n\n*in order for it to find that there has been a breach of those standards in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute [fair and equitable treatment and unlawful expropriation], it will need to determine as an incidental question whether the Source GSPA was validly terminated. However this does not change the fact that the key issue under the Treaty in respect of a claim for unlawful expropriation or breach of the fair and equitable treatment is whether there has been a loss of property right constituted by the contract or whether legitimate expectations arose under the contract.*\n\n82.\n\nIt is for this purpose, and only for this purpose, that the question of the attribution to the Respondent of the acts and omissions of EGPC/EGAS arises. With these clarifications, it is now possible to turn to consider the Parties' pleadings on the applicable legal standards for attribution and their application on the facts, before ruling on the issue.\n\n**B. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants contend that EGPC/EGAS's conduct is attributable to the State in virtue of Articles 4, 5, 8, 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.80 The Tribunal will review briefly the Claimants' arguments pertaining to those articles.\n\nClaimants' Skeleton, para. 34.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the point of departure for assessing whether conduct is attributable to a State is whether the actor in question is a State organ as set out in Article 481:\n\n*1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.*\n\n*2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.82*\n\nReply, para. 326.\n\nILC, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\" with commentaries (2001), II (Part Two) *Yearbook of the ILC* 31, **RLA-255**, Article 4, p. 40. See also US Treaty, **C-7,** Article XII (\"This Treaty shall apply to the political and/or administrative subdivisions of each Party\").\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, under Article 4, the standard for the classification of an entity as a State organ is an international one, and that entities may be classified as State organs under international law even if they do not have that status under their own national law.83\n\nILC, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\" with commentaries (2001), II (Part Two) *Yearbook of the ILC* 31, **RLA-255**, Article 4, p. 42, para 11 (\"while the powers of an entity and its relation to other bodies under internal law will be relevant to its classification as an \u2018organ', internal law will not itself perform the task of classification\").\n\n86.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimants submit that, according to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the acts of an entity that does not qualify as a State organ may nonetheless be attributable to the State in circumstances where the entity exercises elements of governmental authority84:\n\n*The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.85*\n\nReply, para. 327.\n\nILC, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\" with commentaries (2001), II (Part Two) *Yearbook of the ILC* 31, **RLA-255**, Article 5, p. 42.\n\n87.\n\nIn respect of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the Claimants argue that the meaning of governmental authority is specific to the facts of each case. In particular, whether the conduct in question is exercised by private actors under general law or is exclusive to entities acting on behalf of the State (for example, the granting of oil and gas contracts) may be relevant.86\n\nReply, para. 328.

People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3) Award, 12 November 2008, **CLA-164**, paras. 107-109.\n\n88.\n\nIn the further alternative, the Claimants contend that according to Article 8 of the ILC Articles, even when an entity is not a State organ and is not exercising governmental authority, its conduct may be attributable to the State if it acts under the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the State:\n\n*The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.87*\n\nILC, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\" with commentaries (2001), II (Part Two) *Yearbook of the ILC* 31, **RLA-255**, Article 8, p. 47.\n\n89.\n\nIn respect of Article 8, the Claimants argue that factors that may lead to a finding of attribution of such entity's conduct include governmental ownership or control of that entity as well as government participation on the entity's board of directors, or even the submission of the company's minutes of meetings by the Minister.88\n\nReply, para. 329. See *Salini v. Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 July 2001, **RLA-55**, paras. 32-35. See also Case 249/81 *Commission of the European Communities v. Ireland* (1982) ECR 4006, **CLA-166**, para. 15 (Ireland held responsible for conduct of separate entity where Ireland appointed the members of its management committee, granted it public subsidies that covered most of its expenses, and defined its aims).\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants submit that if conduct is not attributable to the State on the basis of Articles 4, 5, or 8 of the ILC Articles, it may nonetheless be attributable to the State under Article 11,89 which provides:\n\n*Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.90*\n\nReply, para. 330.\n\nILC, \"Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\" with commentaries (2001), II (Part Two) *Yearbook of the ILC* 31, **RLA-255**, Article 11, p. 52.\n\n91.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants argue that international law has always recognized the past conduct of an entity which the State later recognizes and adopts as its own, may be attributed to the State.91\n\nReply, para. 331. See E Vattel, *Le Droit des gens*, Book II, Chapter VI, \u00a7\u00a7 73-4 (1758), **CLA-167** ; H. Grotius, *De Iure Belli ac Pacis*, Book II, Chapter XXI, \u00a7 II.1 (1625), **CLA-168**.\n\n92.\n\nAfter having laid out the legal framework in respect of attribution, the Claimants submit that the conduct of the Respondent's actions in the present case is attributable to Egypt.\n\n93.\n\nAt the outset, the Claimants recall that Egypt does not dispute that the conduct (including representations and commitments) of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Egyptian Ambassador to Israel or other Egyptian government representatives are attributable to the Egyptian State.92\n\nReply, para. 336.\n\n94.\n\nThere is no dispute, say the Claimants, that the representations and commitments made in these documents were made by the State. Nor has Egypt disputed that the verbal representations and commitments it made directly to EMG and its shareholders are attributable to the State.93\n\nReply, para. 337.\n\n95.\n\nThere only remains for decision of the Tribunal, write the Claimants, the issue of whether the representations and obligations of EGPC and EGAS are attributable to the Egyptian State.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants submit that both EGPC and EGAS are State organs under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\n\n97.\n\nIn respect of EGPC, the Claimants point out that, according to Egyptian law, it is a \"public authority\", a term defined as an entity with legal personality \"undertak[ing] the management of a utility rendering a benefit or public service\".94 EGPC is therefore a State organ as a matter of Egyptian law, conclude the Claimants, and this renders it a State organ for purposes of international law under Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles.95\n\nDecree No. 61 of 1963 of the President of the United Arab Republic promulgating the Public Authorities Law, 29 April 1963, **C-410**, Article 1.

For alternative arguments that EGPC is a State organ, see Reply, paras. 340-344 (for example, the Egyptian Government is involved in the appointment of members of EGPC's board of directors, and EGPC employees are State employees under Egyptian law).\n\n98.\n\nAlternatively, say the Claimants, EGPC is a *de facto* State organ under ILC Article 4 because96:\n\n(i) It acts within the confines of State policy;97\n\n(ii) Its funds are public funds and its budget requires parliamentary approval;98\n\n(iii) Its employees are public employees;99\n\n(iv) Its board is its supreme power and is populated entirely with State officials in their official capacity;100and\n\n(v) The Minister of Petroleum is the Chairman of EGPC's board and has authority to approve, amend, or annul the board' decisions.101\n\nClaimants' Skeleton, para. 36.\n\n**C-634**, Articles 1 and 9; **C-325**, Article 3.\n\n**C-634**, Article 5; **C-414**, Article 3.\n\n**C-634**, Article 18; **C-609**, p 2.\n\n**C-634**, Articles 2 and 9; **C-413** ; **C-635**.\n\n**C-634**, Article 11.\n\n99.\n\nIn respect of EGAS, the Claimants argue that although EGAS is not considered a *de jure* State organ under Egyptian law, it bears the characteristics of a *de facto* State organ under Article 4(1) of the ILC Articles102 for the following reasons103:\n\n(iv) The Prime Minister created EGAS in 2001 as a public sector holding company;104\n\n(v) EGAS's general mandate is to \"operate in all natural gas activities\" in Egypt. In particular, it is empowered to \"assume the management and supervision of gas activity as shall be determined by the Ministry of Petroleum\";105\n\n(vi) EGAS is wholly-owned by EGPC;106\n\n(vii) EGAS's annual profits are remitted to the Ministry of Finance;107\n\n(viii) As a public sector holding company, EGAS was assigned as supervisory Minister the Minister of Petroleum.108 The Minister has played an active role in the management of EGAS since its incorporation. The Chairman of EGAS's Board reports to the Minister and provides him with, *inter alia*, a quarterly report on the company's activities.109 The Minister, in turn, is required to submit a report on EGAS to the Cabinet on a biannual basis.110\n\nReply, para. 345.\n\nSee Reply, paras.345-350.\n\nPrime Minister's Decree No. 1009 of 2001, 19 July 2001, **C-416**.

[\u2026] [T]he Prime Minister, the Minister of Petroleum, and the Minister of Finance confirmed this fact before the Egyptian Supreme Administrative Court.114 These facts alone are sufficient to conclude that EGPC and EGAS exercised sovereign authority when undertaking commitments and providing assurances to the Claimants and their investment.115*\n\nReply, para. 355.\n\nSee Case No. 111 of Judicial Year 126, Cairo Court of Appeal, 27 May 2010, **C-415**.

EGPC and EGAS held themselves out as representatives of the government, and represented to EMG and the Claimants that they were acting under the control of the highest levels of the Egyptian government.120\n\nReply, para. 359.\n\nSee Ministry of Petroleum Resolution 100/2004, 26 January 2004, **C-26** (incorporated into the Source GSPA, **R-225(A),** Preamble, p. 9), Article 2; Ministry of Petroleum Resolution 456/2005, 23 May 2005, **C-29** (incorporated into the Source GSPA, **R-225(A),** Preamble, p. 12), Article 4; MoU, **C-31**, Article 7; Ministry of Petroleum Decree No. 2511, 30 December 2007, **C-325** ; Committee of Five Report, **C-326**, pp. 18-21, 53-54; Statement of former Egyptian Minister of Petroleum (S.

See C-94 and C-422.\n\n104.\n\nIn furthering their arguments on attribution, the Tribunal recalls that the Claimants invoked their version of the translation of the minutes of the meeting on 24 April 2012 of the Board of Directors of EGPC.\n\n105.\n\nThe original minutes are in Arabic. The parties have filed their respective certified English translations of the minutes.\n\n106.\n\nIn the Claimants' translation, the Board's decision is translated as follows:\n\n*The matter is presented to the esteemed board for its information and*  ***approval.***\n\n***Decision: After a discussion and review of different opinions:***\n\n*The Board noted and*  ***approved*** *the action taken to terminate the contract to supply and purchase gas, signed with East Mediterranean Gas Company on 13 June 2005.\"*\n\n*At the next Board session of the Authority, held on 19/6/2012, the above-mentioned decision of the Authority's Board of Directors was ratified in the presence of the esteemed members of the Board.122*\n\n**C-635**. Emphasis as in original except for the word \"approved\" which has been added.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent's translation reads as follows:\n\n*The matter is presented to the respectful board for information and*  ***acknowledgement*** *.*\n\n***Decision: after deliberations and in light of the opinions exchanged:***\n\n*The board has been informed and has*  ***acknowledged*** *what has taken place regarding the termination of the Gas Supply and Purchase Agreement entered into with EMG on 13 June 2005.*\n\n*In the following session of the board of directors held on 19/6/2012, the decision of EGPC's board of directors has been ratified in the presence of the respectful members of the board of directors.123*\n\n**R-872**. Emphasis as in original except for the word \"acknowledged\" which has been added.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the parties' dispute relates to the Arabic word \"Aqar\" and whether it should be translated as \"approved\" or \"acknowledged\".\n\n109.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Tribunal (with the consent of the Parties) requested a translation from an ICSID approved translator who opined that the Arabic word \"Aqar\" should be translated as \"confirmed\".\n\n110.\n\nAsked by the Tribunal to provide their comments, the Parties both contended that the word \"confirmed\" was consistent with their own respective translations.\n\n111.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants submit that the minutes of that meeting of the EGPC Board demonstrate that EGPC'S termination of the GSPA is attributable to Egypt under any one of Articles 4, 5, 8 or 11 of the ILC.124\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\n112.\n\nIn respect of Article 4, the Claimants contend that the minutes:\n\n*illustrate that State ministers, sitting in their official capacities [as opposed to the individuals themselves], control EGPC's Board and therefore EGPC, since the Board is its highest authority. The Minister of Petroleum is the designated Chairman with plenary authority to approve, amend, or annul all board decisions.* *It is a characteristic of Egyptian State Authorities to have boards controlled by the supervising government minister. This reflects EGPC's status in the Egyptian governmental structure as a State Authority, and therefore its status as a State organ under ILC Article 4.*125\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\n113.\n\nIn respect of Article 5, the Claimants argue that EGPC's Board is populated almost entirely with Egyptian government ministers and that it clearly exercises governmental authority.126\n\nIn *Wintershall A.G., et al. v. Government of Qatar*, Partial Award on Liability of 5 February 1988, 28 I.L.M. 795, 811-812(1989), the tribunal found that the Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC) was an agent of the State. See **CLA-245**, pp 36-38.\n\n114.\n\nIn respect of Article 8, the Claimants contend that these minutes demonstrate that the purported termination of the GSPA was an act of the State as the Board was controlled by the State.127\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that the presence of government ministers only shows that Egypt controls EGPC, but does not show that Egypt gave specific instructions to terminate the GSPA, the Claimants answer that the test under Article 8 is whether EGPC acted under State control or whether the State gave specific instructions to the company. (See Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33.)\n\n115.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Egypt's last argument against a finding of attribution is that termination cannot be attributable to the State on the basis of the meeting of 24 April 2012 since EGPC and EGAS had already terminated the GSPA five days earlier. The Claimants respond that, at the time of the Board meeting, EGPC and EGAS were considering EMG's 22 April 2012 request that they withdraw their purported termination. The EGPC Board confirmed the purported termination, and EGAS conveyed that decision to EMG on 29 April 2012.128 The Respondent's argument thus fails, conclude the Claimants.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\n116.\n\nFinally, in respect of Article 11, the Claimants note Egypt's argument and respond that in view of the fact that EGPC Board members sit in their official capacities, and that the Minister of Petroleum failed to annul or amend the decision at the meeting, even an \"acknowledgement\" of the termination was sufficient for such an act to be attributed to Egypt.129\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 37\n\n117.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Claimants assert that EGPC/EGAS's acts are attributable to Egypt.\n\n**C. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent contends that ILC Articles 4, 5, 8 or 11, on which the Claimants rely, do not provide any basis for attribution.\n\n119.\n\nIn respect of Article 4, the Respondent submits that an entity will be a \"State organ\" if the internal law of the State classifies it as such.130 An entity that has separate legal personality will not be considered as a State organ.131 Even if an entity carries out some public services, that will not make it a State organ.132\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 112.\n\nSee *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, **RLA-295**, para. 161; *EDF (Services) v. Romania*, **RLA-71**, para. 190 and *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (\"*Jan de Nul*\"), ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, **RLA-292**, para. 160.\n\nSee *Jan de Nul*, **RLA-292**, para. 161; *Ulysseas, Inc. v. The Republic of Ecuador* (\"*Ulysseas*\"), **RLA-299**, paras. 127-135.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges however that an entity will be considered a State organ if, in \"*exceptional*\" circumstances it is in \"*complete dependence on the State*\", as the ICJ held in *Nicaragua*133 and in *Bosnia*134. Proof of complete dependence requires \"*proof of a particularly great degree of State control*\".135\n\n*Nicaragua v. United States of America (\"Nicaragua\")*, Internaitonanl Court of Justice, Judgment, June 27 1986, **RLA-270**, paras 109-110. *Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro* (*\"Bosnia*\"), Judgment, 26 February 2007, **RLA-288**, paras 391-393.\n\n*Bosnia*, **RLA-288**, paras. 391-393.\n\n*Ibid*, para. 393.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent submits that EGAS and EGPC are not State organs. As a matter of Egyptian law, both EGAS and EGPC have separate legal personality.136 Moreover, neither EGAS nor EGPC is part of the Government of Egypt, as defined in Article 153 of the Egyptian Constitution.137\n\nSee **RLA-369** and **RLA-391**. Respondent's Opening Slides, v III, 257-262.\n\n**C-388**, Article 153.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that neither EGAS nor EGPC are completely dependent on the State:\n\n(i) EGAS is a private law entity, which invests funds on its own or through affiliated companies, holds its own property as *domaine priv\u00e9* and is financially independent.138 It is represented by the Chairman of its Board in its relationships with third parties and is managed by its Board of Directors.139\n\n(ii) EGPC has and manages its own independent budget, and holds its own capital and funds.140 EGPC must pay corporate tax.141 EGPC's CEO, as EGPC's legal representative, is authorised to conclude contracts for EGPC and is not a government official. EGPC's CEO can bind EGPC in agreements without ministerial approval, which is only required when EGPC, for example, contracts for the export of petroleum products without a tender process.142\n\nSee **RLA-369** and **R-821**.\n\nIbids.\n\nSee **RLA-391** and **RLA-366**.\n\n**RLA-391**.\n\n**R-11**.\n\n123.\n\nIn respect of attribution under Article 5, the Respondent contends that the conduct of the entity must be in the exercise of governmental authority, i.e. there must be an exercise of \"*pr\u00e9rogatives de puissance publique*\".143 However, avers the Respondent, EGPC and EGAS's termination of the GSPA was the kind of decision any private party to a contract could have taken and the Claimants have not demonstrated that the termination was made in the exercise of governmental authority.144\n\nSee *Jan de Nul*, **RLA-292**, para. 170.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 118.\n\n124.\n\nIn respect of Article 8, the Respondent contends that EGPC and EGAS's termination of the GSPA was not done pursuant to the instructions or under the direction or control of the State. The minutes of the meeting of 24 April 2012 on which the Claimants rely145 do not evidence any instruction of the State to terminate the contract since they (i) post-date the GSPA's termination and, in any event (ii) EGPC's Board cannot be considered as the State.146\n\n**R-872**.\n\n**C-92** ; **C-97**. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 119.\n\n125.\n\nIn respect of Article 11, the Respondent submits that it only applies when a State, in a *\"clear and unequivocal*\" manner, \"*acknowledges and adopts [\u2026] as its own*\" conduct that would not otherwise have been attributable to it.147 According to the Respondent, the Minister of Petroleum did not ratify (or confirm) the minutes of the 24 April 2012 meeting and there is no evidence of \"clear and unequivocal\" adoption. For conduct to be adopted as its own under Article 11, the State must \"*identif[y] the conduct in question and make[] it its own.*\"148\n\nSee **RLA-255**, Article 11 and Article 11 Commentary, para. 8, p.53.\n\n**RLA-255**, Article 11 Commentary, para. 6, p.53. See Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 120-124.\n\n126.\n\nFinally, the Respondent stresses that the Claimants cannot point to any unilateral undertaking by the Respondent to supply gas to EMG.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent avers that not one document relied on by the Claimants evidences a commitment by Egypt to supply gas to EMG. Every document relied on by the Claimants simply notes that the GSPA and/or the Tripartite Agreement will be concluded by EGPC and EGAS and these agreements were, in fact, concluded by EGPC and EGAS.149\n\nRejoinder, para. 393.\n\n128.\n\nNor did the Respondent guarantee gas supply to EMG, says the Respondent. The only assurance that the Respondent made in respect of gas supply was made to a third party in the MoU.150\n\nRejoinder, para. 395.\n\n129.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent denies that it ever verbally undertook to supply gas to EMG.151 In any event, the alleged statements of Messrs. Hamdy and Zell152 cannot bind Egypt as it is well settled that international law requires that a declaration be made in public and evidence an intent to be bound in order to have a binding effect.153\n\nRejoinder, prara. 398.\n\nMr. Hamdy alleges that officials from the Ministry of Petroleum assured EMG that the quantities of gas delivered to EMG were to increase to the contractual levels in 2009.542 Mr. Zell alleges that the Egyptian government provided him with \"*direct confirmation* [\u2026] *that Egypt was committed to honor the terms of the deal*\".See Hamdy Witness Statement, paras. 25-30, 57-62; Hamdy Second Witness Statement, paras. 8; Zell Witness Statement, paras. 10.\n\nSee *Case Concerning Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France)*, Judgment, 20 December 1974, ICJ Reports 1974, **RLA-263**, para. 43.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in any event, any declaration made in respect of EGPC and EGAS's supply of gas to EMG before the conclusion of the GSPA would necessarily be superseded by the contract itself. In the words of the *Burlington* v. *Ecuador* tribunal, the purpose of these statements \"*was exhausted when the promises* [\u2026] *were turned into contractual obligations*\".154 The same conclusion must be reached in the present case, affirms the Respondent.155\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (\"*Burlington* v. *Ecuador*\"), ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, **RLA-13**, paras. 206-207.\n\nRejoinder, para. 406.\n\n131.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Respondent asserts that is not responsible for EGPC/EGAS's acts and contractual obligations which cannot be attributed to Egypt.156\n\nFor further argument in relation to whether EGPC/EGAS are State organs, etc., see Rejoinder, paras. 409 and ff.\n\n**D. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n132.\n\nHaving considered the totality of the Parties' submissions on the issue of attribution, the Tribunal will now proceed to set forth its findings and conclusions.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that Egypt does not dispute that the revocation of EMG's tax-free status was attributable to the Egyptian State.\n\n134.\n\nAs noted above, Egypt does dispute, however, that EGPC and EGAS's conduct related to Egypt's gas supply pursuant to the GSPA is attributable to it under international law.\n\n135.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Tribunal has formed the view that the acts or omissions of EGPC or EGAS relevant to the conclusion and termination of the GSPA are attributable to the Respondent under the relevant provisions of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility, which form part of the applicable customary international law.\n\n136.\n\nFor ease of reference, the Tribunal will set out these the relevant articles in full below:\n\n*\"Article 4**Conduct of Organs of a State*\n\n*(1) The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.*\n\n*(2) An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.*\n\n*Article 5**Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority*\n\n*The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.*\n\n*Article 8**Conduct directed or controlled by a State*\n\n*The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.*\n\n*Article 11**Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own*\n\n*Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\"157*\n\n**RLA-255**.\n\n137.\n\nBoth EGPC and EGAS are corporate entities within the overall structure of the Ministry of Petroleum.\n\n138.\n\nThat EGPC is an Egyptian State organ is evidenced by the following.\n\n(i) Pursuant to Egyptian Law No. 20 of 1976158, EGPC is a \"*Public Authority endowed with an independent juristic personality, engaged in developing and properly utilizing the* *petroleum wealth and in supplying the country's requirements of the various petroleum products \u2026*\".\n\n(ii) Pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of Law No. 20, \"*[t]he Authority shall be overseen by the Minister of Petroleum*\" and its capital shall consist of \"*[f]unds allocated to it by the State*\".\n\n(iii) Pursuant to Articles 8 and 9 of Law No. 20, EGPC is governed by a Board of Directors. The chairman of the Board which is appointed by decree of the President of Egypt and the members are appointed by decree of the Prime Minister of Egypt on the recommendation of the Minister of Petroleum.\n\n(iv) Pursuant to Article 11 of Law No. 20, resolutions of EGPC's Board of Directors are forwarded to the Minister of Petroleum for ratification. He is empowered to amend or cancel such resolutions.\n\n(v) By Decree No. 164 of 2007, the President of Egypt decided that \"*[t]he Board of Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation shall be composed under the chairmanship of the Minister of Petroleum and with the membership of: the Minister of Finance; the Minister of Electricity and Energy; the Minister of Investment; the Minister of Trade and Industry; the Minister of State for Local Development; the Head of the Cabinet Advisors' Panel; the Chief Executive Officer of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation; and three employees from the Ministry of Petroleum and the entities affiliated thereto with experience in the main activities of the Corporation. They shall be appointed by virtue of a resolution of the Board of Directors upon a recommendation by the Minister of Petroleum.*\"159\n\n**C-634**.\n\nSee Article 1 of Decree No. 164 of 2007, **C-413**.\n\n139.\n\nAccording to its Organic Law160, EGAS is a public sector holding company wholly owned by EGPC. The Minister of Petroleum chairs its general assembly and recommends the appointment of all assembly and board members.161 It holds funds as public property and distributes its profits to the Ministry of Finance162. Its chairman is a secondee from EGPC.163\n\nDecree No. 1009 of 2001, **C-416**.\n\nIbid., Articles 7 and 8.\n\nIbid., Article 11.\n\nSee **C-339** and **C-418**.\n\n140.\n\nThe evidence reviewed briefly in the following paragraphs also reveals that both EGPC's and EGAS's conduct is clearly attributable to the Egyptian State because they both acted at all times under State direction and control in the sense of ILC Article 8. Furthermore, the State acknowledged their acts as its own under ILC Article 11.\n\n141.\n\nAs recorded in the Preamble of the GSPA:\n\n(i) On 18 September 2000, the Council of Ministers of Egypt adopted a resolution which provides *inter alia* that \"*[t]he Egyptian general Petroleum Corporation shall sell natural gas to East Mediterranean Gas Company for the purpose of export to consuming markets in the Mediterranean area and Europe through the pipeline*\" and records its decision to \"*[a]uthorize the Ministry of Petroleum*  *represented by* *the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to negotiate [\u2026] and conclude the contract.*\" (Tribunal's emphasis.)\n\n(ii) The Egyptian Council of Ministers, by letter of 19 March 2001, informed EMG of this resolution of 18 September 2000.\n\n(iii) By Ministerial Decree No. 100 of 26 January 2004, the Minister of Petroleum authorized both EGPC's Chairman and EGAS's Chairman to contract with EMG in furtherance of the Council of Ministers' resolution of 18 September 2000.\n\n(iv) By Ministerial Decree No. 456 of 23 May 2005, the Minister of Petroleum empowered both EGPC's Chairman and EGAS's Chairman to sign the Source GSPA and the Tripartite Agreement.\n\n(v) By Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Egypt and Israel dated 30 June 2005, the two States recalled the Peace Treaty between them of 26 March 1979, which included provisions for economic cooperation; emphasized that *\"the supply of natural gas from Egypt to Israel will contribute to enhancing peace and stability in the Middle East\";* and acknowledged the Resolution of the Egyptian Council of Ministers of 18 September 2000. By Article 2, Egypt specifically *\"guarantees the continuous and uninterrupted supply of the Natural Gas contracted and/or to be contracted\".* By Article 7, Egypt *\"designates the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and the Egyptian Gas Holding Company (EGAS) as representatives of the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum in signing the tripartite agreement.\"*\n\n142.\n\nWith respect to the termination of the GSPA, the Tribunal notes a memorandum signed by both EGPC's CEO and EGAS's Chairman which records that, following the advice of their international legal counsel, \"*EGPC and EGAS exercised their contractual rights by terminating the contract of supply and purchase of gas in the execution of the stipulations of the commercial contract concluded with EMG, and notified EMG of the termination on Thursday 19/04/2012*.\"\n\n143.\n\nTheir memorandum was tabled before EGPC's Board of Directors on 24 April 2012 as recorded in the minutes of that meeting164 which read as follows:\n\n*The matter is presented to the respectful board for information and*  ***confirmation*** *.*\n\n***Decision: after deliberations and in light of the opinions exchanged:***\n\n*\"The board has been informed and has*  ***confirmed*** *what has taken place regarding the termination of the Gas Supply and Purchase Agreement entered into with EMG on 13 June 2005.\"*\n\n*In the following session of the board of directors held on 19/6/2012, the decision of EGPC's board of directors has been ratified in the presence of the respectful members of the board of directors.*\n\n[Emphasis as in original except for the word \"confirmed\" which has been added].\n\nSee Exhibits **C-635** and **R-872** for the Claimants' and the Respondent's respective translations of those minutes in English. The Tribunal thereafter sought a translation of the Minutes by an ICSID certified translator. The ICSID translator translated the Arabic word \"Aqar\" as \"confirmed\". The translation was accepted by both Parties.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as recorded in the minutes, the meeting was chaired by the Minister of Petroleum, who by decree is designated as the Chairman of EGPC. Many other Ministers, members of EGPC's Board, also attended the meeting as well as the Chairman of EGAS in his capacity as a member of EGPC's Board. EGPC's Board confirmed the termination of the GSPA, an act clearly attributable to Egypt.\n\n145.\n\nThe minutes also record that there was a further meeting of EGPC's Board on 19 June 2012 where the decision to confirm the termination was ratified. The Tribunal recalls that, by law, all decisions of EGPC's Board must be submitted to the Minister of Petroleum for his review165 and that the Minister of Petroleum, by decree of the President of Egypt, chaired the Board at all times.166\n\nSee Article 11 of No. 20 of 1976, **C-634**.\n\nDecree No. 164 of 2007, **C-413**.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is overwhelming evidence that the decisions of EGPC and EGAS to conclude and terminate the GSPA were all taken with the blessing of the highest levels of the Egyptian Government. Such acts are attributable to the Respondent pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility as EGPC and EGAS were \"*in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of\"* the Respondent in relation to the particular conduct.167 In any event, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent subsequently ratified the termination of the GSPA and thus \"*acknowledge[d] and adopt[ed] the conduct in question as its own\"* within the terms of Article 11.\n\nAs in *EDF (Services)v. Romania*, **RLA-71**, paras. 318-319.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore satisfied that, for the purpose of determining whether or not a breach of the US-Egypt BIT occurred as alleged by the Claimants, any acts or omissions of EGPC/EGAS constituting such breach may be attributed to Egypt in the present case and it so finds.\n\n**VI. LIABILITY**\n-----------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, after the Decision on Jurisdiction and Ampal's election, the Claimants modified their claim for damages. They now claim US$635 million detailed as follows168:\n\n**Summary of aggregate losses now claimed in the ICSID arbitration, including interest and value leakage (US$million) and as adjusted to remove David Fischer's claim and reduce Ampal's claim in accordance with its election**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Claimants** | **Impact of Tax Exemption Revocation (until 2025**) | **Impact of Tax Exemption Revocation (beyond 2025)** | **Impact of the First Amendment** | **Impact of the\u00a0Delivery Failure** | **Total Losses (excl.

THE REVOCATION OF THE TAX EXEMPTION (UNTIL 2025)**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, by enacting Law No. 114/2008 which amended the Investment Law and excluded companies, such as EMG, operating, *inter alia*, in petroleum production and transportation, from the Free Zones privileges, the Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment (FET)169 and full protection and security170 standards, as well as the umbrella clause171, and that this constituted an expropriation172 under the Treaty.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 398-403. See also Claimants' Memorial, para. 215.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 477, 484.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 460. See also Claimants' Memorial, para. 242.\n\nClaimants' Reply, paras. 487-489. See also Claimants' Memorial, para. 277.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, it dismissed the Respondent's objection *ratione materiae* over the Claimants' tax claims in the following terms.\n\n*266. Article XI of the US-Egypt BIT is crystal clear. It says what it says that \"**all matters relating to the taxation* *of nationals or companies of a Party, or their investment in the territories of the other Party or a submission thereof*  *shall be excluded from this treaty,* *except with regard to measures covered by Article III \u2026.\" (Tribunal's emphasis).*\n\n*267. The Respondent says that this Article is a specific carve-out but recognizes that taxation measures tantamount to an unlawful expropriation are clawed back and are not excluded from the Treaty. The Tribunal agrees and therefore finds that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claim that the Respondent's taxation measure was tantamount to an expropriation of the Claimants' investment insofar as deprivation of property or rights might have occurred.*\n\n*268. Whether or not the scope to the exception to the carve out for measures relating to expropriation encompasses other obligations in the Treaty in virtue of the so-called \"Gateway Theory\" invoked by the Claimants is not an issue which the Tribunal needs to determine today.*\n\n*269. The Tribunal need not determine either today whether, when Egypt enacted Law 114 in 2008 revoking EMG's free-zone status, it did so in the exercise of its regulatory powers. This is a matter which may arise during the liability phase of this arbitration having regard, in particular, to Decree No. 1020 of 2000 which granted EMG a tax exemption until 2025.*\n\n*270. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses this objection by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.*\n\n152.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will now determine whether the revocation of EMG's tax exemption is tantamount to an expropriation. The Tribunal will begin its analysis by setting out the facts relating to the revocation of EMG's tax license.\n\n**1. Facts relating to the revocation of EMG's tax license**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nEMG was established on 19 April 2000 pursuant to GAFI Decrees 230/2000173 and 1020/2000174. As a free-zone company, EMG had special status under Law 8/1997, entitled \"Promulgating Law on Investment Guarantees and Incentives\".175 Under that law, Egypt committed to exempt companies such as EMG from taxation on their revenue derived from commercial and industrial activities for a period of up to 20 years.176\n\nDecree of the General Authority for Investment and FreeZones approving the incorporation of East Mediterranean Gas Company to operate under the Private Free Zones regime (***GAFI Decree 230/2000***), 29 January 2000, **C-16**.\n\nDecree of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones No. 1020 of 2000 regarding authorization for the establishment of East Mediterranean Gas Company, an Egyptian joint stock company according to the Special Free Zones System (***GAFI Decree 1020/2000***), 17 April 2000, as incorporated in EMG Bylaws, *Investment Gazette* 3381/2000, 28 May 2000, **C-15**, p. 1.\n\nLaw 8/1997 Promulgating Law on Investment Guarantees and Incentives, *Official Journal*, Issue No. 19 (bis) (***Law 8/1997***), **C-17**.\n\nLaw 8/1997, **C-17**, Articles 16-19.\n\n154.\n\nIn 2005, the Egyptian government promulgated Tax Law 91/2005 which cancelled certain tax exemptions under Law 8/1997 for companies not subject to the Free Zones system and instituted a new corporate tax of 20%.177\n\nMemorial, para. 46\n\n155.\n\nThe Law 91/2005 had no effect on EMG which continued to benefit from the tax exemptions under Law 8/1997. The Egyptian government confirmed this in Decree 1917/2006, which authorized EMG to continue to operate as a free-zone company for a renewable term of one year.178 In 2007, Decree 81/M/2007 amended Article 5 of Decree 1917/2006 and extended EMG's tax-fee status for an additional period of 18 years until 18 April 2025:\n\n*The license granted for said Company [i.e., EMG] for exercising its activity under the private free zones system shall be extended as of the date of expiry of the present license on December 24, 2007 and shall expire upon the end of the Company's term specified in its commercial register on April 18, 2025. Said license shall be renewed for other additional terms upon the approval of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones in light of the Company's compliance with the terms and conditions of operation under the private free zones system.*179\n\nDecree 1917/2006 of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones authorizing East Mediterranean Gas Company S.A.E. to operate under the Private Free Zones Regime and identifying its boundaries as a Private Free Zone (***Decree 1917/2006***), **C-129**, Article 1.\n\nDecree 1917/2006, as amended by Decree 81/M/2007 of the Chairman of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones as published in Investment Gazette, 1449/2008, 25 March 2008, **C-19**, Article 1.\n\n156.\n\nOn 5 May 2008, before EMG received any gas, Egypt promulgated Law 114/2008, which revoked the Free-Zone licenses of companies such as EMG operating in certain industries, including transportation of natural gas.180 According to the Claimants, the termination of EMG's Free-Zone License impacted negatively the economics of the Claimants' investment by subjecting EMG to new taxes, including a 20% corporate income tax that was later raised to 25%.\n\nLaw 114/2008, 5 May 2008, **C-61**, Article 11.\n\n**2. Whether the revocation of EMG's tax license is tantamount to an expropriation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the enactment of Law No. 114/2008 was a direct taking of a discrete investment. They also claim that the revocation of the tax benefits associated with EMG's license was one of a series of measures amounting to creeping expropriation.181\n\nReply, paras 486-487.\n\n158.\n\nIn support of their claim that the revocation of EMG's tax exemption by Egypt constituted a direct taking by Egypt of a discrete investment protected under the Treaty, the license, the Claimants write:\n\n*As a license bestowing vested rights directly upon EMG for a defined period of time, it constituted a vested right and an investment directly protected by the [Treaty].182*\n\n*[T]he revocation of EMG's license to operate as a Free-Zone company [\u2026] constituted the direct taking of a discrete investment protected under the Treaties. Egypt contends that \"tax benefits\" do not qualify as an investment under the Treaties, and proceeds to review investment treaty case law relating to the ability of States to introduce general measures of taxation. But the Claimants' \"investment\" is the license itself, not an ancillary tax benefit associated with private Free-Zone status. GAFI authorized EMG to purchase natural gas for export to the eastern Mediterranean as a private Free- Zone company for a defined term of 25 years. This license conferred by GAFI satisfies the broad definitions of \"investment\" in the Treaties which cover \"every kind of asset\" and set out non-exhaustive lists of different types of tangible and intangible assets.183*\n\n*Egypt argues that revocation of that license did not result in a significant deprivation or wholesale destruction of the Claimants' investment. The Claimants do not contend that the loss of the license in itself destroyed the entire Peace Pipeline Project. Since the license was an investment in its own right, the revocation constituted a direct and total taking of a discrete investment protected by the Treaties.184*\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 279.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 488.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 489.\n\n159.\n\nIn response, the Respondent submits that a fiscal benefit, such as the one which EMG enjoyed under the Free Zone Regime, is not a protected investment which can be expropriated.185 In any event, says the Respondent, GAFI's authorization or license to operate under the Free Zone regime is not the same as a concession, nor does it confer to the licensee any self-standing right or benefits beyond those established in Law No. 8/1997.186 Furthermore, submits the Respondent, Law No. 114/2008 is a *bona fide* regulatory measure.187 In this respect, the Respondent argues:\n\n*It is a widely recognised principle that taxation constitutes a special category of regulatory power and that the bar for finding that a tax measure is expropriatory is particularly high. Absent any abusive, excessive, discriminatory or arbitrary character of the measure, as in the present case, an expropriation claim fails.*\n\n*Indeed, the Claimants have failed to show that Law 114/2008 is confiscatory in character or tainted by discrimination. Law No. 114/2008 is a general measure which applied to a number of different sectors of the Egyptian economy including fertilisers and petroleum sectors.*\n\n*Moreover, EMG did not complain of this legislative amendment until it initiated these proceedings over four years after its enactment. [\u2026]188*\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 616.\n\nRejoinder, para. 881\n\nRejoinder, para. 888.\n\nRejoinder, paras 888-890.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine whether the Claimants' tax license constitutes an investment under the Treaty.\n\n161.\n\nThe term \"investment\" is defined at Article I (c) of the Treaty as follows:\n\n*\"Investment\" means*  *every kind of asset* *owned or controlled and includes but is not limited to:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares, stock, or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) valid intellectual and industrial rights property, including, but not limited to rights with respect to copyrights and related patents, trade marks and trade names, industrial designs, trade secrets and know-how, and goodwill.*\n\n*(v)*  *licenses* *and permits*  *issued pursuant to law,* *including those issued for manufacture and sale of products.*\n\n*(vi) any right conferred by law or contract, but not limited to rights within the confines of law to search for or utilize natural resources, and rights to manufacture, use and sell products;*\n\n*(vii) returns which are reinvested.189*\n\n[Tribunal's emphasis]\n\nC-7.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their investment consists of \"*EMG's vested right to tax-free status conferred by Decree No. 1917 of 24 December 2006 to operate under the Private Free Zones Regime, as extended until 2025 by Decree 81/M of 5 December 2007*\"190.\n\nMemorial, para. 180.\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent on the other hand contends that a tax exemption or benefit, enjoyed by virtue of Law No. 8/1997 by companies established in the Free Zone Regime, cannot vest a right to tax-free status particular to the Claimants protected under the Treaty.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent. As will be seen, the relevant laws and decisions in the record do not support the Respondent's submission.\n\n165.\n\nUnder Law 8/1997,191 entitled \"Promulgating Law on Investment Guarantees and Incentives\", the Egyptian government established private free zones. Article 29 of the Law provides that \"*A decree of the competent administrative quarter may be issued concerning the establishment of private free zones, each confined to a single project, if the nature thereof necessitates so doing.*\"\n\nC-17.\n\n166.\n\nThis Law also sets out clearly the benefits enjoyed by companies operating in these private free zones. Article 32 of the Law provides that \"*[\u2026] goods which are exported abroad by the Free Zone projects or imported to exercise their activity shall not be subject to the rules on imports* *and exports, nor to the customs procedures for exports and imports. Nor shall these goods be subject to Customs Taxes, the General Tax on Sales and other taxes and duties.*\"192\n\nIbid.\n\n167.\n\nAs noted earlier, by Decree No. 230 issued on 29 January 2000193, the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) approved the incorporation of EMG to operate under the Private Free Zones regime. The approval by the Prime Minister of the incorporation of EMG under the Free Zones Regime is recorded in the preamble of the decree194 and Article 8 provides that the term of the license shall be 25 years, \"*to be renewed upon the approval of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones.*\"\n\nC-16.\n\nC-16, preamble in relevant part: \"*The memorandum presented by the Free Zones Sector in this respect, which includes the approval of the Prime Minister on the incorporation of the Company under the free zones regime.*\"\n\n168.\n\nBy Decree No. 1020 of 2000195, the GAFI authorized the establishment of EMG as an Egyptian Joint Stock Company according to the Special Free zones system. Article 2 of the Decree states that the objective of the company is to carry out specific activities in the special free zone.\n\nC-15.\n\n169.\n\nBy Decree No. 1917 issued on 24 December 2006,196 the GAFI authorized EMG to operate under the Private Free Zones Regime. Article 5 of the Decree provides that \"*[t]he term of this authorization is one year, to be renewed for other terms in case of meeting all conditions of the private free zones* Article 12 of the Decree provides that \"*[t]his authorization is issued particularly to the Company* *[...].\"**(Tribunal's emphasis)*\n\nC-129.\n\n170.\n\nBy Decree No. 81/M of 5 December 2007,197 the GAFI amended Article 5 of Decree No. 1917 as follows:\n\n*The license granted for said Company [i.e., EMG] for exercising its activity under the private free zones system* *shall be extended as of the date of expiry of the present license on December 24, 2007 and shall expire upon the end of the Company's term specified in its commercial register on April 18, 2025. Said license shall be renewed for other additional terms upon the approval of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones in light of the Company's compliance with the terms and conditions of operation under the private free zones system.*198\n\n(*Tribunal's emphasis*)\n\nC-19.\n\nDecree 1917/2006, as amended by Decree 81/M/2007 of the Chairman of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones as published in Investment Gazette, 1449/2008, 25 March 2008, **C-19**, Article 1.\n\n171.\n\nBy Law No. 114 of 2008,199 the Egyptian government revoked certain licenses. Article 11 of the Law provides as follows:\n\n*The licenses related to investment projects which are established under the free zones system in the field of* *fertilizers, iron & steel and*  *petroleum industries as well as* *the*  *field of* *processing, liquefying and*  *transporting the natural gas,* *and are existing on the date of enforcing the present law,*  *shall be terminated* *.*\n\n[Tribunal's emphasis]\n\n**C-61**.\n\n172.\n\nThere can be no doubt that, by virtue of Law 8/1997 and Decrees Nos. 230 and 1020 of 2000, the Egyptian government conferred to EMG specifically a right to the benefits of a free zone company, including tax-free status, until April 2025. That right was vested in EMG in virtue of the license it was granted by Decree 1917/2006, as extended by GAFI Decree 81/M/2007.\n\n173.\n\nThe license granted by GAFI is an \"investment\" as defined in the Treaty, which refers broadly to \"every kind of asset\".\n\n174.\n\nMore specifically, paragraph V of Article 1 of the Treaty lists \"licenses issued pursuant to law\" as the kind of asset included in the definition of investments. The license conferred by GAFI to EMG is a protected investment under the Treaty and the Tribunal so finds.200\n\nSee the decision in *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, where the tribunal held that a free zone license granted by Egypt to Middle East Cement was a \"[concession] conferred by law\" and therefore met the definition of investment in Article 1 of the Egypt-Greece BIT. Award, 12 April 2002, **CLA-19**, paras. 100-101.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal will now determine whether the Respondent, by enacting Law No. 114/2008, expropriated the Claimants' investment.\n\n176.\n\nArticle III(1) of the US Treaty provides:\n\n*No investment or any part of an investment of a national or company of either Party shall be expropriated or nationalized by the other Party or by \u2013 a subdivision thereof \u2013 or subjected to any other measure, direct or indirect, if the effect of such other measures, or a series of such measures, would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (all expropriations, all nationalizations and all such other measures hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") \u2013 unless the expropriation*\n\n*(a) is done for a public purpose;*\n\n*(b) is accomplished under due process of law;*\n\n*(c) is not discriminatory;*\n\n*(d) is accompanied by prompt and adequate compensation, freely realizable; and*\n\n*(e) does not violate any specific contractual engagement.*\n\n*Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment on the date of expropriation. The calculation of such compensation shall not reflect any reduction in such fair market value due to either prior public notice or announcement of the expropriatory action, or the occurrence of the events that constituted or resulted in the expropriatory action. Such compensation shall include payments for delay as may be considered appropriate under international law, and shall be freely transferable at the prevailing rate of exchange for current transactions on the date of the expropriatory action.*\n\n177.\n\nLaw No. 114/2008 terminated, in terms, the Claimants' license, and the rights associated to it under Law No. 8/1997.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the enactment of Law No. 114/2008 (i) was a *bona fide* exercise of public authority and (ii) cannot constitute an unlawful expropriation as it was not discriminatory in nature and did not deprive the Claimants of the totality of their investment.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the revocation of the license did not, *per se*, destroy the entire Peace Pipeline Project. However, the Claimants submit that since the license was an investment in its own right, its revocation constituted a direct and total taking of a discrete investment protected by the Treaty.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants. The decision in *Gami Investment, Inc. v. The Government of the United Mexican States* in which the tribunal found that \"*The taking of 50 acres of a farm is equally expropriatory whether that is the whole farm or just a fraction*\"201 is an authority which supports its finding.\n\n*Gami Investments, Inc. v. The Government of the United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 15 November 2004, **RLA-145**, paras 126 and 127.\n\n181.\n\nThe incorporation of EMG as *\"an Egyptian joint stock company established according to the Special Free Zones System under the Investment Law No. 8 for the year 1997\"* as the vehicle for the Claimants' investment was an integral part of the investment. It is recorded as such in the opening words of the GSPA. Mr. Zell deposed that he *\"emphasized the importance of EMG's tax-free status\"* in his discussions with Government ministers in 2008.202\n\nZell Witness Statement, para. 16.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the inclusion of EMG within the tax-free zone system in Egypt was a fundamental part of the economic structure of the investment, which the Respondent knew and accepted from the outset at the highest level of Government, and which it confirmed by the issue of the specific licence to EMG, conferring tax-free status under the free zones system until 2025. These facts take the consideration of a change in the tax regime applicable to Claimants' investment in EMG well outside the realm of the ordinary exercise of the State's regulatory power.\n\n183.\n\nIn the case of this investment, the Respondent's decision to remove EMG's tax-free status took away a defined and valuable interest that had been validly conferred according to Egyptian law at the time that the investment was made and that had been guaranteed by the State for a defined period. It was not to be subject to the vicissitudes of changes in State tax policy over that time period. For this reason, the taking is tantamount to expropriation.\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the revocation of the Claimants' license was a *bona fide* exercise of public authority and not discriminatory in nature. The Tribunal accepts that Law No. 114 of 2008 was enacted for public purposes, including increasing the remuneration of civil servants; increasing civil and military pensions and increasing the commodities specified in ration cards (Article 1). Its provision for the revocation of tax free licences (Article 11) applied to all investment projects under the free zones system *\"in the field of fertilizers, iron & steel and petroleum industries as well as the field of processing, liquefying and transporting the natural gas.\"* It was not specifically targeted in a discriminatory fashion at the EMG.\n\n185.\n\nHowever, Article III(1) of the Treaty protects an investment from expropriation unless, inter alia, it is accompanied by \"*by prompt and adequate compensation\".* The Article goes on to prescribe that such compensation *\"shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment on the date of expropriation.\"*\n\n186.\n\nBy these terms, Article III(1) creates an international obligation on the part of the State to pay compensation for the expropriation of an investor's property. This Tribunal is empowered to enforce that obligation, calculating the amount of compensation due according to the standard prescribed in the Treaty, in the event that the State fails to pay such compensation. This does not require the Tribunal to find that the expropriation in question was unlawful, as may be the case in the event that the taking was not done for a public purpose or was discriminatory.203\n\n*Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Award, 13 March 2015, paras. 129\u2013146.\n\n187.\n\nHaving found that the revocation of the tax exemption is tantamount to an expropriation, the Tribunal need not determine whether the revocation of the tax exemption also constitutes a breach of the FET, the full protection and security standards of the Treaty or the umbrella clause by virtue of the so-called \"*Gateway Theory*\".\n\n**C. THE REVOCATION OF THE TAX EXEMPTION (BEYOND 2025)**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants submit that EMG would have retained its Free-Zone status after the expiry of its License in 2025 and claim damages beyond that year.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that this claim is entirely speculative and should not be entertained by the Tribunal.\n\n190.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue the following:\n\n*the assumption that EMG would have maintained its free-status indefinitely is sound.* *The Egyptian State represented to the Claimants that EMG would operate as a Free-Zone company, without any suggestion that this status would expire. Moreover, the renewal of EMG's Free-Zone License was contingent merely on EMG complying with* *the conditions for operating as a Free-Zone company. Egypt has offered no basis for the conclusion that EMG would not have complied with those conditions in the counterfactual scenario. In any case, it has a minimal impact on the Claimants' damages.204*\n\nReply, para. 608.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimants.\n\n192.\n\nWhether the license would have been renewed on 18 April 2025 by GAFI is entirely speculative and the Tribunal sees no ground on which it could base such a decision.\n\n193.\n\nAccordingly, the damages owed to the Claimants by the Respondent as a result of the revocation of EMG's tax license will be calculated up to 2025 and not beyond.\n\n**D. EXECUTION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT (ALLEGED COERCION)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they were coerced into signing the First Amendment to the GSPA which, they allege, is a breach of the FET, the full protection and security standards and the umbrella clause of the Treaty, and that this was an element of the creeping expropriation by Egypt of their investment.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine whether the Claimants were indeed coerced into signing the First Amendment.\n\n196.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants have not discharged their burden of proof in relation to their allegation that they were coerced into signing the First Amendment. Quite the contrary, the evidence reveals that, far from being coerced, the Claimants considered that it was in their interest to negotiate and execute an amendment to the GSPA.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that by Decree No. 2511 of 2007, the Minister of Petroleum instructed \"*the Chairman of the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company and the Chief Executive Officer of the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation [to] review all sale agreements and contracts concluded for supplying natural gas to local and international markets and undertake necessary actions for negotiating with parties to said agreements in order*  *to profit from any increase in the financial proceeds of said agreements and contracts as a result of the higher oil prices in the international markets,* *with the objective of maximising the proceeds and resources of the Petroleum Sector therefrom.*\"205 (*Tribunal's emphasis*)\n\nSee **C-325**, Article 2.\n\n198.\n\nBy letter dated 3 April 2008, EGPC and EGAS, noted that \"*an unprecedented change was recently witnessed in the international markets for crude oil and natural gas, whereby [\u2026] natural gas price indicators ranged between US$8 and US$11/MMBtu*\", and invited EMG to meet in order to discuss \"*alternatives to restore balance between the parties of the Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement*\".206\n\n**C-51**.\n\n199.\n\nBy letter dated 16 June 2008, Mr. Zell wrote to Mr. Rachid, Minister of Trade & Industry as follows:\n\n*Dear Minister Rachid,*\n\n*I enjoyed meeting you and Minister Fahmy last Monday and from our discussion believe we will be able to quickly and amicably resolve the issues we both currently face. As agreed, I am outlining the situation affecting the relationship between the Government of Egypt (GOE) and East Mediterranean Gas (EMG) and the menu of potential areas of flexibility which will allow for an equitable solution.*\n\n*The EMG/EGAs supply contract was signed in 2005 when the $35/barrel maximum reference price of crude oil was deemed conservative. Obviously, substantial higher oil prices have increased the pressure on the GOE to raise the price it charges for natural gas. However, EMG has negotiated in good faith with its Israeli off-take clients over the past few years given its signed contract with EGAS for 7 BCM/year at $1.50/mmbtu and with no price opener for 15 years. [\u2026] Moreover, EMG's tax-free status was also a critical component to reaching these capital decisions and any change thereto will hurt EMG's current stakeholders significantly.*\n\n*[\u2026]*  *[I]t is in the interest of both the GOE and EMG* *to determine a revised pricing scheme that allows the GOE to publicly announce higher pricing for its gas but does* *not undermine the economic viability of EMG or EMG's credibility with the Israeli market.*\n\n*EMG categorizes its clients in three groups and they are probably the best means to focus our discussion [\u2026] \u2013*\n\n*1. The Israel Electric Company (IEC) contract for 2,125 BCM/year*\n\n*2. Clients purchasing the next 2,375 BCM/year that represents the balance of the initial 4.5 BCM/year, the delivery schedule of which was according to the contract and confirmed by EGAS*\n\n*3. The third quantity of 2.5 BCM/year under the 7.0 BCM per annum contract, anticipated for delivery beginning in 2012.*\n\n*The initial quantity under the IEC contract is by far the most problematic for EMG to adjust its pricing. As you know, based on the contract signed with EGPC/EGAS on June 13, 2005, EMG signed the fixed-price 20-year IEC contract on August 5,* *2005. [\u2026] [T]o the best of our understanding, IEC is unable to pay more for gas under this contract [\u2026]*\n\n*EMG is slated to begin delivering gas to the second group of clients in 2010. [\u2026]*\n\n*EMG has more flexibility on the final 2.5 BCM of gas, although we need to be respectful of the off-take market in which we have been negotiating. [\u2026]207*\n\n**C-167** (emphasis added).\n\n200.\n\nOn 25 June 2008, the Minister of Trade and Industry replied to Mr. Zell's proposal in the following words:\n\n*After studying your letter carefully, we are constrained to assume that we have not properly conveyed to you the current realities of the energy challenges we are all facing.*  *It is hard to negotiate a pricing scheme of physically unavailable commodity.* *We have to admit shortfalls of other existing supply agreements, particularly those which are supplied from the national grid [which includes the Source GSPA] and not directly linked to dedicated export fields. [\u2026]*\n\n*[\u2026] The overriding element is physical availability of surplus gas, which in fact would hardly cover what you refer to as the first group of 2,125 BCM/p.a.208* (*Tribunal's emphasis*)\n\n**C-168**.\n\n201.\n\nNegotiations followed both with respect to the pricing scheme and the availability of the gas. They were concluded by the end of 2008 and the First Amendment was executed on 31 May 2009.209\n\nTr. Day 2, 139/10-17. First Amendment, **C-50**.\n\n202.\n\nThe principal changes which were introduced by the First Amendment are the following:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Before the First Amendment** | **After the First Amendment** |\n| **Quantity** | Up to 7 BCM per year (Art. 5.1) | Q1: (IEC volumes): 2,125 BCM per year Q2: 2,375 BCM per year Q3: up to 2.5 BCM per year with the Parties to begin negotiations no later than 1 January 2011 to agree a delivery schedule to begin between 2014 and 2017 (Art. 5.3) |\n| **Price** | US$1.50 per MMBTU (Art. 2.2.1) | Q1: US$3.00 per MMBTU Q2: US$3.00 to US$4.00 per MMBTU Q3: subject to the Parties' agreement (Annex 5, paras. 1-5) |\n| **Shortfalls** | Hourly Shortfall Compensation Daily Shortfall Compensation (Annex 1, Arts. 6.7-6.8) | Hourly Shortfall Compensation Daily Shortfall Compensation Monthly Shortfall Compensation (Annex 1, Arts. 6.7-6.9) |\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, on the same date, EGPC, EGAS and EMG concluded the following agreement (the \"**Release Agreement**\"):\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*Each of the Parties hereby undertakes and agrees as follows:*\n\n*1. Subject in all events to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this letter, as of the First Amendment Effective Date,*  *each Party hereby releases the other Party from any liability for breach or alleged breach pursuant to the GSPA which may have occurred during the period up to the First Amendment Effective Date.*\n\n*2. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Paragraph I above, each Party shall retain all rights under the GSPA against the other Party, and the releases set forth in Paragraph 1 shall be of no force or effect, in the event of any claim by the Initial On-Sale Customer with respect to any breach or alleged breach under the Initial On-Sale Agreement, the GSPA or the Tripartite Agreement which may have occurred prior to the First Amendment Effective Date.210*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\nLetter from EGPC and EGAS to EMG dated 31 May 2009, **C-60** (emphasis added).\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they were coerced into signing the First Amendment. They say that, as part of their strategy to induce EMG and the Claimants to renegotiate the GSPA and agree revised gas price and volumes, EGPC and EGAS withheld gas supply and refused to issue invoices.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimants, in support of this allegation, refer to the testimony in an Egyptian court proceeding of Ismail Hamed Ismail Karra, the First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Petroleum responsible for gas affairs at that time:\n\n*Q: In light of the non-existence of a mechanism that allows for modification of the price in the old contract [i.e., the Source GSPA], how was the contract and pricing amended?*\n\n*A: We had made up some technical problems and relied on them to not deliver the gas in the dates determined in the contract and threatened that we did not have the capacity to supply gas so that we could force them to enter into negotiations through which we managed to raise the price and modify the terms.211*\n\nPublic Prosecution, Attorney General Bureau, State Security Supreme Prosecution, Minutes of Questioning of Ismail Hamed Ismail Karra: First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Petroleum, Case No. 41 of 2011 January Events Complaints, 13 March 2011, **C-169**.\n\n206.\n\nWhether or not EGPC and EGAS, as part of their negotiation tactics, were withholding supply and refusing to issue invoices in order to induce EMG and the Claimants to renegotiate the GSPA and consent to the government's demands is of no moment in view of the clear evidence of the Claimants' negotiator, Mr. Zell, that the First Amendment was in the interest of EMG.\n\n207.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that the volumes of gas to be delivered were not modified under the First Amendment. As the Claimants themselves concede in their Reply, \"*[t]he significance of dividing the quantities into Q1, Q2, and Q3 related to schedule and price, not availability of the full 7 BCM annually*.\"212 In other words, the Claimants were still contractually entitled to receive 7 BCM of gas annually after the First Amendment was executed.\n\nMemorial, para. 118.\n\n208.\n\nAs to price, the renegotiated price was to apply retroactively to Q1 quantities, an escalated price was set for Q2 quantities, and Q3 prices were to be established by the parties at a later date.\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they were coerced into renegotiating and agreeing those new prices in circumstances where the Egyptian Government failed to deliver the gas, putting the entire project at risk.213\n\nZell cross-examination, Tr. Day 4/47/14-16.\n\n210.\n\nAgain, the evidence does not support the Claimants' allegation. As recorded in Mr. Zell's letter of 16 June 2008214, the Claimants were clearly amenable to the renegotiation of prices in view of the increase in the price of crude oil in the international markets. There is no mention in that letter of any opposition to the renegotiation of prices.\n\n**C-167**.\n\n211.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants were not affected by the price increase as they preserved their margins on Q1 volumes by passing on to IEC this price increase. This was confirmed by Mr. Zell during his cross-examination:\n\n*Q: [\u2026] I'm saying that if you compare the initial GSPA and the GSPA with the first amendment, it's a fair statement that in contractual terms, with respect to Q1, EMG's margin was entirely preserved because the increase in price was entirely passed on [to] IEC; correct?*\n\n*A. Correct.*\n\n*Q. Right. So \u2013*\n\n*A. However, the fact that you didn't -- the Egyptian Government didn't deliver the gas effectively made the amendment, you know, the terms of it, irrelevant in terms of preserving our prior position.*\n\n*Q. But, Mr. Zell, isn't it then a problem of implementation of the first amendment, as opposed to, \"The first amendment is killing me, it's terrible, it's terrible for me\"? It's a matter of implementation of the first amendment. Had the first amendment been implemented properly, according to what you say you expected, then you would have been happy, right?*\n\n*A. If we had gotten what we had bargained for, we would be happy.215*\n\nZell cross-examination, Tr. Day 4/49/4-23.\n\n212.\n\nAs to gas delivery schedules, the Claimants argue that \"*[the] delays in the delivery schedule for full volumes constituted a substantial concession by EMG, reducing the value of the Claimants' investment significantly [\u2026]*\"216\n\nMemorial, para. 118.\n\n213.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants. Only Q3 volumes were contractually subject to delays. Indeed, the First Amendment delayed the initial delivery of Q3 volumes (2.5 BCM per contract year) until sometime between 2014 and 2017, at a date to be agreed in 2011. As noted above, at the time of the conclusion of the First Amendment, EMG had signed only three contracts, with a total volume of 2,934 BCM.217 The Tribunal does not believe that the Claimants were coerced into conceding to a delayed delivery for Q3 volumes when, at the time, they had not even contracted with on-sale customers for volumes of gas above the 4.5 BCM threshold set by the Q3 volume category.\n\nSee First Expert Report of Wood-Collins, pages 67-68.\n\n214.\n\nFinally, the Minutes of the Meeting of the EMG Board of 2 November 2009 is contemporaneous evidence that the Directors of EMG were pleased with the conclusion of the First Amendment. There are two versions of the Minutes and the differences between the two versions are shown in track changes below:\n\n*Mr. Abdel Hamid Hamdy thanked the Board and stated that without the good relation between the shareholders and the full support of Mr. Hussein Salem [one of EMG's founders] who was always supporting us and paving the road in order with the shareholders which led that*  *our negotiation with the Government is fruitful* *and that he was they were always brainstorming ideas to us which concluded all the amendment we achieved and as well Mr. Abdel Hamid Hamdy thanked Merhav Group for their support during such period and thanked Ms. Ellen Havdala for all her support as well.*\n\n*Mr. Hamdy thanked the Board for their initiative regarding the above mention bonus which is on top to the generous bonus Mr. Hussein Salem gave to EMG team from his personal account which is very much appreciated (Mr. Hamdy pressed that the bonus they receive from Mr. Salem is way above the said bonus and he is announcing such to eliminate any* *misunderstanding in the future).*218\n\n(Tribunal's emphasis)\n\nSee **R-965** (the original minutes) and **R-966** (the alleged forged minutes).\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal need not make a finding as to which version of the Minutes is accurate as it considers that both versions record the Board's satisfaction with the conclusion of the First Amendment.\n\n216.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants were not coerced into concluding the First Amendment. Accordingly, this claim which, they allege, resulted in multiple breaches of the Treaty and caused them damages, is dismissed.\n\n**E. IMPACT OF DELIVERY FAILURES**\n----------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they are entitled to damages in view of the Respondent's failure to ensure regular and continuous supply of the volumes committed under the terms of the GSPA.\n\n218.\n\nAccording to the Claimants' quantum experts:\n\n*1.19 As a result of the failure to ensure supply of the volumes committed before the Date of Injury (the \"Past Delivery Failures\"), the Claimants were deprived of the equity value that would have resulted from EMG's profits from the on-sale of gas to its Israeli customers under the terms of the various agreements that were in force before the Date of Injury. [\u2026]*\n\n*1.20 The repudiation of Egypt's gas supply obligations and the failure to supply any gas beyond the Date of Injury (the \"Future Delivery Failures\") caused EMG to be deprived of cash flows in the foreseeable future and EMG's shareholders of the return on their prior investment. [\u2026]*\n\n*1.21 Past and Future Delivery Failures deprived EMG of substantial profits, reducing the value of the Claimants' interest in EMG. [\u2026]219*\n\nFTI Consulting First Expert Report, paras 1.19-1.21.\n\n219.\n\nThe Date of Injury corresponds to the date on which EMG accepted EGAS's repudiation of the GSPA, to wit 9 May 2012.\n\n220.\n\nWith respect to Past Delivery Failures, the Claimants' quantum experts write as follows:\n\n*Each day, EMG provided the Seller with daily nominations reflecting the request from EMG's On-Sale Customers. Providing that the amounts requested were consistent with the terms of the GSPA, the Seller was obliged to deliver the gas the following day. The Seller however often failed to meet this obligation and delivered significantly less gas than was properly nominated.220*\n\nFTI Consulting First Expert Report, para. 4.4.\n\n221.\n\nThey explain that damages arising from Past Delivery Failures were assessed from 1 July 2009, after the First Amendment came into effect, up to the Date of Injury.221\n\nFTI Consulting First Expert Report, para. 4.3.\n\n222.\n\nThey then divide this period of time into two sub-periods, the first from 1 July 2009 to 31 January 2011, and the second from 1 February 2011 to 9 May 2012.\n\n223.\n\nAs regards the first sub-period, they write: \"*[t]he difference between the amount nominated and actually delivered until February 2011 was 1.12bcm, or 21% of the total amount nominated*\".222\n\nFTI Consulting First Expert Report, para. 4.5.\n\n224.\n\nAs regards the second sub-period, they write:\n\n*We understand from Counsel that from February 2011 onwards, the Seller claimed a series of Force Majeure periods [due to attacks on the pipeline] (311 days out of a total of 464 between 1 February 2011 and 9 May 2012) during which EMG generally stopped nominating gas to the Seller, or nominated reduced amounts of gas. In comparison to the 3.97 bcm that was or we assess would have been nominated but for the Delivery Failures from February 2011 to the Date of Injury, only 0.53 bcm, or 13.3% of the total amount nominated or that would have been nominated absent the Seller's Force Majeure claims, was delivered.*\n\n225.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has to determine whether the Respondent breached the Treaty by failing to supply gas to EMG during three periods: (1) between July 2009 and January 2011, (2) between February 2011 and May 2012, and (3) following EMG's acceptance of EGAS's repudiation of the GSPA.\n\n**1. Delivery Failures from 1 July 2009 to 31 January 2011**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe first period runs from the conclusion of the First Amendment until the outbreak of Arab Spring and the incidence of attacks on the Pipeline. The Claimants allege that in this period EGPC and EGAS failed to deliver the quantities of gas that EMG was entitled to receive under the GSPA and has suffered a loss of profits as a result.223\n\nMemorial, paras. 119 \u2013 126; Reply, paras 54 \u2013 63. The Claimants and their experts do not separately itemise their alleged losses in this period, claiming it as part of a global claim for losses attributable to delivery failures between 1 July 2009 and 9 May 2012, the Date of Injury.\n\n227.\n\nIn addition to its jurisdictional objections,224 the Respondent submits on the merits that this element of the claim is not well founded. It alleges that:\n\n(1) EMG was only entitled to receive gas that it had actually nominated under the terms of section 6 of the GSPA and not the maximum amount of gas provided for in the First Contract Year;225\n\n(2) The Claimants' claim exceeds the amount of Q1 gas that may be nominated in any given period under section 5.4 of the GSPA;226\n\n(3) The Claimants include nominations for unauthorised customers for which EMG did not follow the mandatory procedures of the GSPA;227 and,\n\n(4) To the extent that there was any shortfall, the contractual procedure provided under the GSPA was to deduct any compensation from the payments due to EGPC and EGAS.228\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 229 \u2013 257.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 380 \u2013 381.\n\nRejoinder, para. 502.\n\nIbid.\n\nRejoinder, para. 501.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the dispute about alleged delivery failures during this period can possibly amount to an international delict such as a breach of the Respondent's treaty undertaking to provide fair and equitable treatment or to compensate for expropriation.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants also allege a breach of the observance of undertakings \u2013 or \"umbrella\" \u2013 clauses in the UK-Egypt BITs, which they submit they are entitled to invoke pursuant to the MFN clause in the US-Egypt BIT.229 In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal reserved to the merits phase the question whether such clauses in Egypt's treaties with third States might properly be invoked pursuant to the MFN clause, noting that *\"[i]n due course the question may become otiose.\"*230\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 77, citing Art. 2(2) of the U.K.-Egypt BIT, **C-98**.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 256 \u2013 7.\n\n230.\n\nHere the Tribunal finds that it does not need to determine the question of whether, as a matter of international law, the umbrella clauses in treaties with third States may be invoked to found a cause of action on the part of the Claimants in the present proceedings. That is because on no view does the Tribunal consider that, in the period prior to 1 February 2011 could the Respondent be considered to have failed to observe its undertakings.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants invoke the undertaking to deliver *\"up to 7 BCM of natural gas per year to EMG.\"*231 The Tribunal considers that this undertaking cannot be separated from the precise requirements of the GSPA itself, which was the means by which the undertaking was given effect. It has also found that the Respondent committed no breach of treaty in concluding the First Amendment. As a result, the extent of the delivery obligatons upon EGPC/EGAS and the modalities for giving effect to such obligations must be construed in the light of the terms of the GSPA as amended by the First Amendment. Further, Articles 6.8 and 6.9 of Annex 1 to the GSPA anticipate the possibility of shortfalls in delivery and provide a contractual procedure for compensation.232\n\nMemorial, para. 238.\n\nR-225(H).\n\n232.\n\nThe ICC Tribunal gave detailed consideration to EMG's claim of delivery shortfalls in its Award.233 For the period in question it found that *\"the Shortfall Compensation regime represents a complete code of remedies in cases of delivery breach\"* and that *\"[t]he Parties do not question that EGAS complied with the Shortfall Compensation regime until the end of January 2011.\"*234\n\n**C-667**.\n\nIbid, paras. 1282 \u2013 1283.\n\n233.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants have not alleged any other basis upon which the Respondent may be said to be in breach of its undertakings beyond the basic delivery obligation, which the Tribunal has already held must be construed in its contractual framework.\n\n234.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants claim for alleged losses in this period must be rejected.\n\n**2. Delivery Failures from 1 February 2011 to 9 May 2012 (Attacks on the Pipeline)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a)***  ***Introduction***\n-----------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Egypt failed to take steps to protect the Claimants' investment from damage caused by third parties in breach of the full protection and security standard under the Treaty.\n\n236.\n\nThey argue that Egypt failed to take reasonable precautionary, preventive, and remedial measures to ensure the physical security of its pipeline network from attacks by saboteurs between February 2011, which corresponds to the beginning of the Arab Spring Revolution, and April 2012, which corresponds to the termination of the GSPA. They say the pipeline was attacked thirteen times over this period by saboteurs intent on preventing the flow of gas to EMG and from EMG to Israel. These attacks caused damage that prevented EGPC/EGAS from supplying EMG with gas for substantial periods over 2011 and early 2012.235 In fact, say the Claimants, no gas at all was delivered in 328 of the 464 days between 1 February 2011 and the termination of the GSPA on 9 May 2012.236\n\nMemorial, para. 249.\n\nFTI Consulting, first report, para. 1.13.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent does not deny that these thirteen attacks on the pipeline occured. It submits, however, that those attacks which affected EGPC and EGAS's gas deliveries under the GSPA are in effect a series of *force majeure* events pursuant to Article 16 of Annex 1 to the GSPA.237 EGPC and EGAS' gas delivery obligations under the GSPA were therefore suspended during these periods (311 days out of a total of 464 between 1 February 2011 and 9 May 2012) asserts the Respondent.238\n\nArticle 16 of Annex 1 to the GSPA is quoted, in relevant part, at para. 301 below.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 386.\n\n238.\n\nA diagram of the attacks on the pipeline is attached as Annex 1 to the present Decision.239\n\nThis diagram was filed by the Claimants with their Memorial.\n\n***(b)***  ***Applicable Standard***\n------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its jurisdiction derives from the Treaty. It must therefore apply the Treaty standards in its analysis rather than any standard under the contractual regime of the GSPA such as *force majeure* or failure to act as a Reasonable and Prudent Pipeline Operator (\"**RRPO**\").\n\n240.\n\nArticle II(4) of the US-Egypt BIT provides that \"*[t]he treatment, protection and security of investments shall never be less than that required by international law and national legislation.*\" The Tribunal considers that one important element of the international law standard is the requirement to provide full protection and security.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the duty imposed upon the host State by this standard is not one of strict liability. Rather the State is obliged to exert due diligence in order to protect a claimant's investment \u2013 a standard that must be assessed according to the particular circumstances in which the damage occurs.240\n\nThe earlier authorities on the engagement of state responsibility in respect of the acts of private persons, including those engaged in revolutions or civil wars, are also consistent on this point: International Law Commission, *Digest of the decisions of international tribunals relating to state responsibility* [1964] 2 YB ILC 132, 152\u20134.\n\n242.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that a Chamber of the International Court of Justice in *Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) (United States of America v Italy)* held that it \"*cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed.*\"241 Although the investor's factory had been occupied by the workers for some time, the Chamber observed that \"*[t]he dismissal of 800 workers could not reasonably be expected to pass without some protest*\".242 It concluded that the conduct of the Italian authorities, in protecting the plant and even continuing some production, did not fall below the standard.\n\n*Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)* ICJ Rep. 15, Judgment, 20 July 1989, **RLA-118,** para 108.\n\nIbid.\n\n243.\n\nSimilarly, in *AAPL v Sri Lanka,* the tribunal found that the standard was not one of strict liability and was in accord with the standard in customary international law.243 The tribunal relied on both jurisprudence and doctrine as supporting this standard.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award, 27 June 1990, **CLA-117**.\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that subsequent awards have confirmed that the standard is not one of strict liability, but rather one of due diligence.244 In *Pantechniki,* Sole Arbitrator Paulsson further suggested that the adequacy of the State's response should be assessed in the light of the scale of the disorder and the extent of its resources:\n\n*A failure of protection and security is to the contrary likely to arise in an unpredictable instance of civil disorder which could have been readily controlled by a* *powerful state but which overwhelms the limited capacities of one which is poor and fragile. There is no issue of incentives or disincentives with regard to unforeseen breakdowns of public order; it seems difficult to maintain that a government incurs international responsibility for failure to plan for unprecedented trouble of unprecedented magnitude in unprecedented places. The case for an element of proportionality in applying the international standard is stronger than with respect to claims of denial of justice.*245\n\ne.g. *Tecnicas Medioambientales, Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003 **CLA-22**, para. 177; *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* 15 ICSID Rep. 274, Partial Award, UNCITRAL, 2006, **CLA-31**, para. 484.\n\n*Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, **RLA-168**, para. 77.\n\n245.\n\nThe duty imposed by the international standard is one that rests upon the State. However, since it concerns an obligation of diligence, the Tribunal is of the view that the operation of the standard does not depend upon whether the acts that give rise to the damage to the Claimants' investment are committed by agents of State (which are thus directly attributable to the State) or by third parties. Rather the focus is on the acts or omissions of the State in addressing the unrest that gives rise to the damage.246\n\n*American Manufacturing and Trading Inc v. Republic of Zaire,* ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, Award, 21 February 1997, **RLA-124**, ; *Wena Hotels Limited v.

The Respondent provided its comments on 17 February 2016 and the Claimants on 11 March 2016.\n\nPara. 10.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent submits that *\"the Tribunal must take into account the ICC Tribunal's order as a factual datum in order to avoid double compensation\".*248 At the same time it submits that the Tribunal must disregard the ICC Tribunal's reasoning on the merits.249 If, nevertheless, the present Tribunal is minded to take the ICC Award into account, it submits a list of findings made by the ICC Tribunal that it invites the present Tribunal to consider.250\n\nRespondent's Submission on ICC Award, para. 6.\n\nIbid, paras. 27 \u2013 62.\n\nIbid, paras. 63 \u2013 77.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the ICC Award has no impact on the quantum of compensation that this Tribunal should award.251 On issues of liability, it argues that the treaty claims over which the Tribunal has found jurisdiction do not depend on the ICC Award.252 It submits that the Respondent's position is \"paradoxical\".253 Having argued before the present Tribunal that the issues before it turn on issues of contract, it now seeks to disavow the decisions of a tribunal charged with determining the contractual claims.\n\nClaimants' Response on ICC Award, Part II.\n\nIbid, Part III.\n\nIbid, para. 20.\n\n252.\n\nThe present Tribunal has been concerned throughout these proceedings with the potential for overlap and inconsistent findings between the various tribunals charged with determining claims arising out of the same factual matrix between the same or related persons. It was for that reason that it directed the Parties (who are both represented by the same counsel in all the proceedings) to keep it fully informed as to the decisions of the other tribunals. It determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the concurrent pursuit of claims in contract and under treaty is not an abuse of process and did not deprive the present Tribunal of jurisdiction or render the present claims inadmissible.254 But this is not to say that the decisions of other tribunals on questions within their respective remits are necessarily irrelevant to its decision on the merits.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 328 \u2013 9.\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal observed in its Decision on Jurisdiction, citing with approval the Decision on Annulment of the Vivendi Committee, that *\"in order for it to find that there has been a breach* *of [the fair and equitable treatment and expropriation] standards in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute, it will need to determine as an incidental question whether the Source GSPA was validly terminated.\"*255 At the same time it emphasised that the question of breach of treaty remained one for it, to be judged by the reference to international law.\n\nIbid, paras. 253 \u2013 5, citing *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, **CLA-85**, para. 105\n\n254.\n\nThe same point may be made about the factual findings in relation to attacks on the pipeline. The question for the present Tribunal is whether the Respondent failed to exercise due diligence in protecting the Pipeline, and thus the Claimants' investment, from attack. An essential predicate to this question is the determination of the issues of fact as to the nature of the terrorist attacks on the Pipeline and the response of the Respondent.\n\n255.\n\nThese factual issues have already received very detailed consideration by the ICC Tribunal for the purpose of its decision as a matter of contract law as to whether any failure of gas supply in this period is excused by *force majeure.*\n\n256.\n\nThe present Tribunal must therefore consider as a prelimary matter whether, and if so to what extent, the decisions of the ICC Tribunal on those questions bind the Claimants in the present proceedings.\n\n257.\n\nThe determination of the *res judicata* effect of the ICC Award on the Claimants in the present proceedings turns upon two questions:\n\n(i) the effect of a determination in the contractual dispute upon the treaty claims in the present proceedings;\n\n(ii) the effect of a determination in a case to which the investment company (EMG) is party upon the rights of its shareholders as investors.\n\n*Effect of findings in contract forum*\n--------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nWhere the parties have chosen the forum to decide their contractual dispute, the findings of that court or tribunal will be entitled to *res judicata* effect within the legal order in which they were rendered.256 Accordingly, where a contractual claim between an investor and the host State has been the subject of an authoritative determination by an arbitral tribunal appointed under the contract, \"*[t]he authority as res judicata of a decision given by another competent jurisdiction between the same parties, concerning the same claims and based on the same factual and legal bases, prohibits a party from reintroducing a new action that is similar on all points.*\"257\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, **RLA-10**, upheld on annulment, 3 July 2013.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 103(b).\n\n259.\n\nIf, in order to decide a claim of breach of treaty, an investment tribunal is obliged first to answer a question of contract law, that question must be decided by reference to the proper law of the contract. The Tribunal is of the view that where a contractually appointed tribunal has decided that question as between the parties, the investment treaty tribunal is entitled to refer to, and rely upon, the findings of the contract tribunal, provided that it finds the resulting award to be binding upon the parties258 which is the case here today.259\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/ 08/18, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2013, paras. 156 - 160.\n\nAlthough the Award of the ICC tribunal has been challenged before the Swiss Courts.\n\n*Effect upon investors*\n-----------------------\n\n260.\n\nInvestment treaties permit a shareholder with a different nationality from that of the investment company to pursue his own direct claim against the host State for loss to his investment, even though such investment is held indirectly through the investment company. One of the consequences of that is that the investor/shareholder is treated as a privy to the investment company for the purposes of the rule of *res judicata*. Otherwise the investor/shareholder would be able to approbate and reprobate from the same investment treaty. He would take the benefit of an extended right of direct action\u2014looking through the investment company at the economic effect of the host State's actions directly upon his shareholding\u2014which would not found the basis of a claim under customary international law. But he would not bear the burden of being bound by any finding arising out of a claim by the investment company itself on the same facts.\n\n261.\n\nIn other legal contexts, the doctrine of *res judicata* applies not simply to the parties themselves, but also to those who are in privity of interest with them. As Megarry V-C put it in *Gleeson v J Wippell & Co Ltd*, \"*there must be a sufficient degree of identification between the two to make it just to hold that the decision to which one was party should be binding in proceedings to* *which the other is party. It is in that sense that I would regard the phrase \"privity of interest*\"'.260 Similarly, in European private international law, the European Court of Justice has held that the requirement of \u2018same parties' for *lis pendens* purposes extends to cases where there is an identity of interest such that the claims of the two parties are *indissociable*.261\n\n*Gleeson v. J. Wippell & Co. Ltd.* [1977] 1 WLR 510, 515.\n\nCase C-351/96 *Drouot Assurances SA v Consolidated Metallurgical Industries* [1998] ECR I-3075.\n\n262.\n\nThis approach has now been adopted in two important investment awards considering the *res judicata* effect of prior awards rendered in claims brought by investment companies wholly owned by the claimants in the second arbitration. These two decisions are not on the record of the present arbitration. The Tribunal nevertheless relies on them as they are in the public domain and state a general principle of law.\n\n263.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada*262 concerned the effect of the award of a prior ICSID Tribunal dismissing claims brought by a corporate entity, RSM, that was wholly owned by the three individual claimants in the *RSM* proceedings. The Tribunal held that the decisions in the prior Award bound the claimants by way of issue (collateral) estoppel. It reasoned:\n\n*[T]he fact the three individual Claimants were not parties to the prior arbitration does not assist. This is because they are, and were at the time of the Prior Arbitration,* *RSM's three sole shareholders. They were thus privies of RSM at the time. As such, they, like RSM, are bound by those factual and other determinations regarding questions and rights arising out of or relating to the Agreement.*\n\n*Of course, RSM is a juridical entity with a legal personality separate from its three shareholders. But this does not alter the analysis. First, the Claimant shareholders' only investment is a contract to which RSM is a party and the shareholders are not: the shareholders seek compensation for damage they allege they have suffered indirectly, \"through RSM,\" for violations of RSM's legal rights.*\n\n*It is true that shareholders, under many systems of law, may undertake litigation to pursue or defend rights belonging to the corporation. However, shareholders cannot use such opportunities as both sword and shield. If they wish to claim standing on the basis of their indirect interest in corporate assets, they must be subject to defences that would be available against the corporation - including collateral estoppel. Second, the three individual Claimants collectively own 100% of RSM's stock and therefore entirely control the corporation. In these circumstances, we agree with Respondent, that there is nothing unfair in holding them to the results of RSM's Prior Arbitration.*263\n\n*RSM Production and Others v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, Rowley P, Nottingham, Tercier.\n\nIbid, paras. 7.1.5 - 7.1.7.\n\n264.\n\nIn *Apotex Holdings Inc v. USA,*264 the Tribunal had to consider the effect of a prior NAFTA Award between Apotex Inc and the United States upon a subsequent claim brought, *inter alia*, by the parent company, Apotex Holdings Inc. It held, following *RSM*, that Apotex Holdings is to be treated as a privy with Apotex Inc its subsidiary: \"*Its relevant claims in this arbitration, albeit made in its own right and in its own name, depend upon Apotex Inc's ANDAs [Abbreviated New Drugs Applications] as investments under NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139; and if these are not investments, Apotex-Holdings cannot bring such claims before this Tribunal as a matter of jurisdiction.\"*'265\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, Veeder P, Crook, Rowley.\n\nIbid, para. 7.40.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the ICSID tribunals in these cases make two points that are applicable to the position of the parties in the present case vis-\u00e0-vis the ICC Award between the investment vehicle (EMG) on the one hand and the Egyptian State instrumentalities with which it contracted on the other hand (EGPC & EGAS).\n\n266.\n\nThey apply the doctrine of *res judicata* to the parties to the prior award and to those persons who are in privity of interest with them. They do so on the basis that since, in the context of investment arbitration, a shareholder is entitled to pursue a claim for investments that are indirectly held through a corporation, it must also be subject to defences that would be available against the corporation, including the defences of estoppel based on a prior judgment.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that, in the two cases cited above, the investment vehicle was wholly-owned by the claimant, and that, in the present case, in addition to the Claimants, other shareholders own EMG.\n\n268.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants in the present proceedings are in privity of interest with EMG, the claimant in the ICC proceedings. The Claimants' claims in the present proceedings exist only through EMG and in respect of a contract that EMG entered into. This is reflected in the Claimants' claim for damages: the Claimants are only seeking in damages the diminution of the value of their shares as a result of the damages sustained by EMG.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found in Part IV C above that the relevant acts of EGPC and EGAS are attributable to the Respondent. EGPC is an organ of the Respondent. The relevant acts of EGAS were directed by the Respondent or adopted by it as its own conduct. As a result, the Respondent is in privity of interest with EGPC and EGAS and is bound by the findings of the ICC Tribunal on the same facts.\n\n270.\n\nIt is on this basis that the Tribunal concludes that the findings of the ICC tribunal which are relevant to the claims before this Tribunal have a *res judicata* effect between the Parties in the present proceedings.266\n\nThis finding of the Tribunal is without prejudice to the Tribunal's findings on quantum in the next phase of the present arbitration.\n\n***(d)***  ***Relevant Findings of the ICC Tribunal***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe ICC tribunal recorded at para. 596 of its award that \"*although the Tribunal has found it lacks jurisdiction under the GSPA, it is uncontested that the Parties have empowered the Tribunal to interpret and apply the GSPA in adjudicating the force majeure issue*\".\n\n272.\n\nThe ICC tribunal then made certain factual findings in respect of the attacks on the pipeline and determined that those attacks did not consist of *force majeure* events under the GSPA. The ICC tribunal ultimately concluded that EGAS had failed to act as a Reasonable and Prudent Pipeline Operator under the GSPA.\n\n273.\n\nAs the Tribunal determined above,267 the full protection and security standard under the Treaty is applicable in the present case and the Tribunal has determined the scope of that standard.\n\nSee *supra*., paras. 239-247.\n\n274.\n\nWhile the ICC tribunal's findings in relation to *force majeure* and RRPO under the GSPA are not relevant in the present case, the ICC tribunal's findings of fact in respect of the attacks of the pipeline are *res judicata* between the parties in the present proceedings.\n\n275.\n\nThese findings of fact of the ICC tribunal include the following.\n\n*The Pipeline*\n\n*597. Line 36 of the Arab Gas Pipeline is almost 192 km long and runs between Damietta and the east of Al-Arish, where it connects with EMG's own section of the pipeline. Line 36* *has been defined as the \"****Pipeline****\".*\n\n*598. The Pipeline is a straight pipe, interrupted by valve stations, railway valves, traps and offtake rooms [jointly, the \"****Facilities****\"]. The Pipeline has around 15 of such Facilities, all relatively small in size (typically, 25 m x 25 m). These Facilities serve specific purposes and usually host valuable equipment. Off-take rooms, for example, are used to connect the main pipeline with a ramification of smaller diameter leading to a certain customer and house among other material, metering equipment used to measure supplies to a particular customer.*\n\n*599. Another characteristic feature of the Pipeline is that for half of its length it is looped. The section of the Pipeline between Off-take room nos. 2 and 3 is doubled: there is thus a mainline with several valve rooms, and a simple looping line of approximately 100 km length.*\n\n*600. EMG's facility is located at the end of the Pipeline in the town of El Sheikh al Zuwaid \u2013 in close vicinity of the Gaza border. From there, the pipeline is operated by EMG and leads underwater to Israel.*\n\n*North Sinai*\n\n*601. The Pipeline crosses North Sinai. All experts agree that this has been and continues to be a historically conflictive zone. It is populated mostly by Bedouin, who were marginalised during the Mubarak era, and regarded themselves as an alien body within the Egyptian Republic. Restricted from entry into the formal economy, Bedouins developed a market for unlicenced tourism, cannabis and opium cultivation, arms-running and smuggling into Israel and Gaza. Bedouin are organised in tribes, with their own terrain; and revenues from the informal economy helped revive old coping mechanisms and patronage networks.*\n\n*602. After the Camp David Accords, Egyptian military presence in Sinai was curtailed. Sinai was divided in four zones, named A through D, with Egyptian military presence decreasing from west to east. EGAS' Pipeline runs through Zone B, where military force was limited to four infantry battalions (approx. 2,000 troops), armed with AK 47 rifles. As a counterweight to the low military presence, there was a strong local police (under the Ministry of Interior), which \u2013 at least during the Mubarak era \u2013 was effective in keeping the area secure.*\n\n*Revolution and attacks*\n\n*603. With the eruption of the popular uprising that toppled President Mubarak in January 2011, Sinai's Bedouin seized the opportunity to shrug off Egypt's internal security yoke and push for communal empowerment. Militants grew strong and lawless, and their violence against the police led Egypt's State police to abandon the area. A security vacuum resulted.*\n\n*604. In this context of revolution, in the period between February 2011 and April 2012 the Pipeline suffered a total of 13 attacks, which significantly affected gas supply.268*\n\nICC Award, paras. 597-604.

Warren J. Whiting, Annex 2.\n\n277.\n\nThe ICC Tribunal then carried on with its factual findings.\n\n***5.1***  ***THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIPELINE***\n\n*759. The Pipeline crossing the Sinai peninsula was built in 2001, the GSPA was signed in 2005, while it was not until 2008 that the EMG Pipeline entered into operational mode for the supply of gas to Israel.*\n\n*760. At the beginning of the XXI century, when the construction of the Pipeline was undertaken, EGAS and GASCO (the Pipeline operator) must have been aware that a pipe crossing a historically conflictive zone, which was (at least partially) intended for the supply of gas to Israel, was open to attack. The awareness of some risk is evidenced by the fact that EGAS decided to adopt at least certain protective measures:*\n\n- *Some segments of the Pipeline were protected by cement* *: experts have explained that in risky areas it is advisable that the pipeline be covered with cements slabs as an additional protection to delay attacks; of the 192 km long Pipeline, a 30 km long section was covered with cement; no explanation has been provided as to why only this small proportion of the pipeline benefitted from this extra protection, or on the criteria used to select the portion of the pipe which was protected; it can already be anticipated that all attacks on the pipe were performed on unprotected segments;*\n\n- *GASCO sought offers for the procurement of security systems* *: experts agree that the installation of special fibre optic monitoring cable buried above the pipeline is a basic detection measures, and visual surveillance is also essential to detect intrusions; there is some evidence that GASCO asked international companies to submit offers for the supply of fibre cable and visual surveillance; there is however no proof that this equipment was ever procured or employed.*\n\n- *All facilities were surrounded by a*  *defensive brick wall* *topped by barbed wire.*\n\n***5.2***  ***OPERATION OF THE PIPELINE UP TO THE REVOLUTION***\n\n*761. The Pipeline operated for a period of three years (2008 \u2013 2011), before the Arab Spring Revolution toppled the government of President Mubarak. EGAS has not provided much information on how it organised security during that period.*\n\n*762. In his expert report Mr. Pelham recalls that though police presence was limited in size and arms, due to the Camp David Accords, the State Security apparatus was effective in tamping down dissent, and he did not shy away from conceding that such effectiveness was procured by the use of all kind of means, including non- conventional ones.*\n\n*763. There is no evidence that during this period any special security measures were adopted, and the Tribunal must assume that police protection plus limited structural defences around facilities were the only measures in existence. In any event, it is a fact that the Pipeline did* *not suffer any harm during three years: save for a threat which was reported in June 2010, no incidents occurred.*\n\n*EMG 's security*\n\n*764. EMG, on the other hand, who had to operate its own facility in North Sinai, approached security concerns the opposite way: instead of relying on the local police, it contracted the Ministry of Interior to militarise and fortify its premises, providing guards in nine sentry towers, with a total of 50 armed guards securing the facility, taking shifts at all gates and patrolling the compound with an armoured vehicle. Guards were supervised by an officer and a retired general from the Army was engaged as a consultant. The facility also provided housing for guards and weapon storage.*\n\n*765. Mr. Pelham (EGAS' expert on security in Sinai) has confirmed that EMG's facility was well guarded, when he testified that it lay behind the road leading from Al Arish to Sheikh Zuwayed and that, whenever he passed by the road, his guides would caution him not to stop, because EMG's guards were prone to open fire.*\n\n***5.3***  ***ATTACKS AFTER THE REVOLUTION***\n\n*766. On 25 January 2011 a popular uprising precipitated the fall of the Mubarak regime. Chaos and violence ensued in Egypt. Particularly in North Sinai, violent Bedouins seized the opportunity to shrug off Egypt's internal security yoke and push for communal empowerment. Across the peninsula, police took flight, while police stations and prisons were attacked. And the Army, too preoccupied with events in Cairo and the Nile Valley, shied away from curbing the mayhem in the Sinai.*\n\n*767. The Pipeline's security, which had mainly relied on police forces, literally disappeared overnight. Insurgents soon took advantage of the vacuum and attacked the Pipeline. Between February 2011 and April 2012 (the date of termination of the GSPA), the Pipeline suffered 13 attacks. In contrast, EMG, who operated in the same area at the same time, suffered one attempted attack, which was quickly repelled.*\n\n*768. All of the attacks (but one) took place around the area of Al Arish. The first six targeted facilities on the Pipeline (such as valve and off-take rooms), while the other seven blew up segments of pipe. It is no surprise that saboteurs, at first, preferred the Facilities to the pipe: Facilities are the most vulnerable elements of a Pipeline, as they are:*\n\n- *limited in size (not bigger than 25 m x 25 m) and number (there were around 15 of them);*\n\n- *located above ground (in comparison to the pipe, which is mostly buried) and therefore easy to locate; and*\n\n- *house valuable equipment, so that damage to a facility causes potentially more severe economic consequences than damage to the pipe.*\n\n*On the other hand, it is equally true that for the same reasons, the 15 Facilities are easier to protect than the pipe, which runs for 192 km.*\n\n***A.***  ***ATTACKS ON FACILITIES***\n\n*769. There were a total of six attacks on facilities: on off-take room no. 4, trap 2 (twice), off-take room no. 3, railway valve no. 2 and valve station no. 7. Attacks started on 5* *February 2011 and there were two more on 27 March and April 2011. A two month truce ensued. But attacks resumed, hitting twice on 4 and 12 July 2011 and once again on 27 September 2011.*\n\n***a.***  ***ATTACK NO. 1 (AND 2) (FEBRUARY \u2013 MARCH 2011)***\n\n*770. After the fall of President Mubarak on 25 January 2011 the police fled from North Sinai and the Pipeline's protection was left to itself. Some 10 days thereafter, the first attack occurred.*\n\n*771. All proven facts regarding the first attack have been drawn from the Technical Report dated 10 April 2011, which EGAS prepared and sent to EMG, and from contemporaneous press articles. The facts are the following:*\n\n*On 5 February 2011 at 8.30 am four masked men arrived in two unmarked vehicles at off-take room no. 4, which is located some 20 km east from El-Arish. The perimeter brick walls with wire fences on top and the four guards who were posted \"in the area\" were not sufficient deterrent. There is no proof of how saboteurs forced the guards to leave their post: none of the produced documents mentions whether the attackers or the guards were armed nor, if they were, what kind of arms they had. In any event, it is undisputed that no shooting took place and, though saboteurs and guards were equal in number, there is no evidence that the guards challenged the attackers. The attackers locked the four men who guarded the facility in a car and placed two explosives that were successfully detonated, causing a large fire and significant damage to the pipe and the gas filtering and metering equipment.*\n\n*772. There is no evidence that a security protocol was set in motion to apprehend the attackers. The Technical Report only describes the actions taken to control the damages caused on the Pipeline. And there is also no evidence that EGAS adopted any security measures after the first attack or that it performed a risk assessment.*\n\n*773. The second attack took place on 27 March 2011 at Trap 2, which is 10 km west from El-Arish. The attack is of minor significance because no damage was caused and gas flow was only stopped for half a day. The assault is only worth mentioning because it has been described by EGAS as a successfully repelled attack. Yet the evidence (a contemporaneous news article) shows that it was pure luck that no damage occurred: apparently six armed persons attacked the (only) guard present at the facility and set a bomb, but the explosive failed to explode. Again, there is no evidence that a response protocol was activated, nor of any measures being adopted to increase security.*\n\n***b.***  ***SUBSEQUENT ATTACKS AND REACTIONS***\n\n*Attack no. 3 (April 2011)*\n\n*774. Exactly a month later, the third attack took place at off-take room no. 3, which forks from the Pipeline to supply customers in El-Arish. For reasons which have not been disclosed, this point of the Pipeline was especially prone to attacks: after this initial attack, the pipe close to the off-take room would again be blown up in five successive blasts (November 2011 \u2013 April 2012).*\n\n*775. The Technical Report prepared after this third attack only mentions that on 27 April 2011 at 3.30 am the off-take room was blown up with explosives. There is no indication of any guards being present and the fact that the attackers were not described reinforces the* *presumption that there were no security forces guarding the facility.*\n\n*Reaction from the State (May \u2013 June 2011)*\n\n*776. After three unchallenged attacks there is evidence showing that the Egyptian State decided to get involved in the security issues affecting the Pipeline. The Ministry of Defence and the Supreme Military Council warned EGAS that they would not allow resumption of the gas transmission unless additional security on the Pipeline was provided and, in particular, the following measures were undertaken:*\n\n- *raising height of fences;*\n\n- *installing barbed wires on top of fences;*\n\n- *increasing lighting;*\n\n- *levelling sand dunes around each site; and*\n\n- *installing monitoring system with TV cameras.*\n\n*777. Upon this warning, GASCO's Chairman and its Managing Director held a meeting on 1 June 2011 in which they took the following decisions:*\n\n- *to assign the security of valve rooms to the Engineering Service of the Armed Forces with an estimated cost of 3,023,000 Egyptian pounds;*\n\n- *to build 20 housing units to accommodate the security agents;*\n\n- *to install 5,562 km of barbed wire around the gas rooms;*\n\n- *to heighten walls with 4,782 km of concertina wire.*\n\n*778. The minutes of the meeting reflect that the above decisions were subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The first of the decisions, however, seems to have been executed right away, because EGAS has produced a copy of a check in an amount of 3,023,000 Egyptian pounds, the beneficiary being the Engineering Service of the Armed Forces.*\n\n*779. A second meeting, this time of GASCO's Board of Directors was held on 15 June 2011. The Board of Directors approved two of the decisions proposed by the Chairman and Managing Director:*\n\n- *The purchase of iron angles to heighten the walls with wire, in an amount of 160,750 Egyptian pounds;*\n\n- *The construction of 20 housing units for the security agents in an amount of 400,000 Egyptian pounds.*\n\n- *GASCO's Contingency Plan (probably after June 2011).*\n\n*780. IEC has produced GASCO's Contingency Plan, which it obtained through the document production procedure. The document is dated April 2011, but according to IEC there are doubts whether all of its content was prepared at such date.*\n\n*781. The Contingency Plan lists the so called \"solutions applied to the reactive phase to avoid* *the recurrence of line explosion accidents\". Although the term (\"applied\") is used, a careful analysis of the Contingency Plan reveals that: (i) not all of the measures proposed were actually implemented, and (ii) those measures that were implemented, could not have been in place by April 2011:*\n\n*782. (i) The list clearly differentiates between measures which were in place and those which were still being discussed:*\n\n- *Solutions in place:*\n\n- *Cooperation with armed forces and Ministry of Interior to secure the site of priority valve rooms and supervision of the Al-Arish line using four-wheel drive cars provided by GASCO and cell phones to ensure communication in case of discovery.*\n\n- *Establishing guard persons in the valve rooms and stations and along the line track, with accommodation rooms.*\n\n- *Metal cladding of the doors of valve rooms, changing the barbed wire and raising its height in valve rooms, and improve lighting.*\n\n- *Solutions under discussion: assignment of the protection of valve rooms to a specialised security company able to provide trained and armed staff; a study is to be prepared and, if accepted, a tender should be organised.*\n\n*783. (ii) The Contingency Plan is dated April 2011 in its front page. The list with the security solutions is an annex to the document. Was this attachment prepared on the same date as the Contingency Plan, or was it added at a later stage? Contemporaneous evidence seems to indicate that the list may have been added afterwards: the minutes of GASCO's Board of Directors meeting mentioned supra in paras. 777 and 779, where cooperation with the Army, the building of housing and the raising and installation of barbed wire was considered for the first time, took place two months later, in June 2011. And payment for the construction of accommodation was not made until December 2011 (see para. 796 infra).*\n\n*Attack no. 4 (July 2011)*\n\n*784. This is the only attack that did not occur within a 25 km radius around Al-Arish radius, but 80 km west from Al-Arish. The attack took place on 4 July 2011 and targeted Railway Valve Room 2. According to a press article, it was again pure luck that not all the explosives exploded and therefore damage was constrained to a one day shutdown.*\n\n*785. The Technical Report prepared by EGAS does not describe any additional protective measures in place (this was the first attack after the warning made by the State requiring additional protection), and the photographs contained in the report show a protective perimeter wall with a wire fence on top, which does not seem to be significantly higher than the walls around previously attacked facilities. IEC has produced a very interesting newspaper article, contemporaneous to the attack:*\n\n*The article is dated 21 July 2011 and refers in total to three attacks which seem to coincide with Attacks nos. 3, 4 and 5. The reporter had the opportunity to interview guards involved in the attacks, other security guards, neighbours, and even a security official of GASCO. The scene described in the report is very similar in all attacks: the facility is guarded by unarmed persons who, once confronted with armed attackers, leave the site immediately. Guards complain that their duty is to monitor the stations rather than to protect them because \"security without weapons means that there is no security\", and that a two meters high wall covered with barbed wire is no obstacle to attackers. Criticism extends to the housing, which consists of primitive tents, and to the absence of any lighting which makes identification of suspects in the area impossible. GASCO was also blamed for lack of response: in case of Attack no.* *4 guards reported unusual suspicious activity in the area before the attacks, but triggered no reaction in GASCO. In the case of Attack no. 5, the guard \"rushed to call the security officers [\u2026] but none of them was able to do anything about the situation [\u2026] then there was an explosion\".*\n\n*Attack no. 5 (July 2011)*\n\n*786. This attack has given rise to much debate. On 12 July 2011 Valve Station 7 was assaulted. This is the one shutdown of gas which affected EMG only, because Valve Station 7 is located 2 km east from the offtake heading south to Jordan. There is an allegation made by EMG that this damage, although less complex, took the longest to repair (84 days), the reason being that Israel was the only customer affected, and so EGAS had no incentive to speed up repairs.*\n\n*787. The attack is reported in a Technical Report prepared on 28 December 2011. For once this report provides some details on how the attack was perpetrated and how security was built up. The account of events is the following:*\n\n*Apparently Valve Station 7 was secured by one guard only, living there with persons whom the experts identify as family (the report simply refers to \"those associated with him\"). The facility was protected by the usual brick wall with wire fence on top, but there seemed to be also a lower concertina wire fence running in parallel.*\n\n*Around 1 am four armed masked individuals entered the facility, threatened the guard and demanded that he leave the facility. The guard complied with the order, and promptly (at 1.20 am) contacted the security officer in the administrative offices of GASCO, who in turn informed the security officer at the East Gas station. This security officer called the military force unit in the area (pro memoria: in June GASCO had transferred a significant amount of money to the Army for security services). The security officer reported that only some soldiers were available, but not the Army officer in command, and the soldiers then replied that they could do nothing.*\n\n*40 minutes after the initial call from the guard, the explosives placed at Valve Station 7 exploded. There was no attempt to identify or chase the intruders.*\n\n*788. This new attack caused the State to intervene again on security issues. The Technical Service of the National Defence Council requested GASCO to draft a memorandum on surveillance of the Pipeline. GASCO sent on 26 July 2011 a technical study to secure the Pipeline by monitor surveillance cameras and digital recording systems for a distance of 190 km with a cost of 16,875,000 Egyptian pounds. There is no evidence that surveillance cameras ever were purchased or employed: no purchase order, contract, proof of payment, footage or pictures has been produced by EGAS.*\n\n*Attack no. 6 (September 2011)*\n\n*789. On 27 September 2011 Trap 2 exploded. This attack is noteworthy because it was the last attack perpetrated against facilities and it was also the second assault on the same target (Trap 2 had already suffered an attack on 27 March 2011 but at that time luckily explosives failed to detonate).*\n\n*790. In contrast with the first assault, this second time there was not even one watchman. In fact, the attack was noticed \u2013 according to the Technical Report on prepared by EGAS on* *28 December 2011\u2013 by the watchman of another facility (Valve Room 5), who saw distant fire on the track of the pipeline towards Al-Arish.*\n\n***B.***  ***Attacks on pipe***\n\n***a.***  ***Operation Eagle (August 2011)***\n\n*791. The Egyptian armed forces, well-resourced and the largest in the Middle East, remained powerful after the January uprising. At that time the Egyptian military had 11 battalions in the Sinai Peninsula and on 30 July 2011 it launched operation Eagle aimed at reverting the deterioration of the general security situation in Sinai.*\n\n*792. By the end of August 2011 3,750 soldiers were placed to supply area defence and road blocks were set up. There is no evidence whether the duties assumed by the Army included the protection of the Pipeline. Brig. Ling submits that it was not until March 2012 that troops started assisting with direct pipeline protection and EGAS has not challenged this assertion. Be it as it may, there is no doubt that the presence of the Military in the area had an effect on attackers: saboteurs shifted their modus operandi to attacking the pipeline, instead of the facilities.*\n\n*793. As said before, from a security point of view, facilities and pipes are the two basic elements to protect and they are completely different from another: facilities are more vulnerable because they are visible, limited in number and size and contain valuable equipment; the segments of pipe are difficult to locate because they are (mostly) buried, but on the other hand, it is extremely burdensome to guard a 192 km long Pipeline with security forces.*\n\n***b.***  ***SUBSEQUENT ATTACKS AND REACTIONS***  *Attacks nos. 7, 8 and 9 (November 2011)*\n\n*794. Attacks nos. 7 and 8 targeted the pipeline at the same segment: 121 KP. The first was on 10 November 2011; and as soon as damage was repaired it was attacked a second time on 25 November 2011. Attack no. 9 hit two sections of the pipe (136 and 148 KP).*\n\n*795. The modus operandi was the same: saboteurs dug up sections of the pipeline and detonated explosives. This is only a presumption because EGAS provided no technical reports. There is also no evidence that any security measure detected the attacks and/or responded to them.*\n\n*796. After the especially violent month of November, GASCO's Board of Directors met on 14 December 2011. The minutes of the meeting reflect that the Board decided to:*\n\n- *pay 10 Million Egyptian pounds to the Engineering Service of the Armed Forces to build housing camps for the security agents;*\n\n- *pay 655,820 Egyptian pounds to the Engineering Service of the Armed Forces to protect police vehicles;*\n\n- *complete land communication means with telephone lines for a cost of 1 Million Egyptian pounds.*\n\n*797. There is evidence of the disbursement of the 10 Million Egyptian pounds; no proof has been marshalled as regards implementation of the other measures.*\n\n*Attacks nos. 10 \u2013 13 (December 2011 \u2013 April 2012)*\n\n*798. Despite the payments made to the Army, and of a further payment of 2 Million Egyptian pounds made in early March 2012, attacks did not stop, but went on \u2013 while the GSPA was in force \u2013 until 9 April 2012. All sabotages concentrated around two segments:*\n\n- *151/153 KP: Attacks nos. 10, 11 and 12 (18 December 2011, 5 February and 5 March 2012). This section of the pipe was attacked three times in a row, as soon as repairs were completed.*\n\n- *140 KP: Attack no. 13 on 28 November 2011 (this segment had already been attacked in no. 9).*\n\n*799. The modus operandi was the same and no technical reports were provided which could serve as evidence of the security measures in place. It must be assumed that security measures had not improved.*\n\n***5.4***  ***ATTACKS ON OTHER TARGETS***\n\n*800.*  *In the hazardous environment of the Sinai, during this period violent groups targeted various assets. The parties have discussed at length two particular scenarios: the facilities of EMG and of the MFO. [\u2026]*\n\n*801.*  *Interestingly, both parties have used the example of the MFO in support of their arguments: EGAS to report a case which, despite heightened security, could not prevent attacks; IEC to show how the MFO enhanced security after the Revolution and the first attacks.*\n\n*802.*  *The MFO stands for the Multinational Force and Observers, an independent international organisation with peacekeeping responsibilities in Sinai, whose main base is located in El Gorah, in Zone C (pro memoria: the Pipeline mainly runs across Zone B, with higher military presence).*\n\n*803.*  *As evidence of MFO's efforts in security, IEC has produced the 2011 Annual Report, which summarises the attacks suffered by the MFO:*\n\n- *Local grievances in the form of peaceful protests outside MFO facilities, intermittent attempts to restrict the movement of MFO vehicles.*\n\n- *On 27 May 2011 an improvised explosive device was exploded as a armoured vehicle passed.*\n\n*[Note: the parties also placed importance on the attack on the MFO's main base in September 2012. Since this occurred after the termination of the GSPA and long after the events for which EGAS has claimed force majeure, the parties' discussion is not relevant and will be omitted from this summary.]*\n\n*Response by the MFO*\n\n*804.*  *As early as the first uprisings, the MFO set in motion a series of internal steps to review possible enhancements to its security and to increase vigilance at all their sites. Concurrent with increased security concerns the MFO conducted a weekly evaluation of security and travel conditions which resulted in an advisory approved by the Force Commander on security concerns. In March 2011, at the request of the Director General,* *the U.S. Army Central Command Joint Security Office conducted a force protection assessment of both MFO camps, of all remote sites and of the dock area.*\n\n*805.*  *The MFO undertook the following security improvements:*\n\n- *remote site renovations completed by October 2011, including the installation of ballistic towers, replacement perimeter fencing, protective blast walls, bunkers and improved lighting;*\n\n- *acquisition of five fully armoured vehicles, in addition to the exiting three light armoured vehicles;*\n\n- *command and control procedures: including, among other things, a new operations centre, centralising all operational elements and facilitating command and control of MFO assets.*\n\n***5.5***  ***IDENTITY OF THE ATTACKERS***\n\n*806. Gen. Eiland (one of IEC's experts) notes that up to three terrorist organisations have claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Pipeline: Ansar al-Hijad in the Sinai, Ansar Baytal-Maqdi and Al-Jabhahal-Salafiya fi Sinaa.*\n\n*807. Based on his expertise, Gen. Eiland is of the opinion that Ansar Baytal-Maqdis are the most credible authors of the attacks. Mr. Pelham (EGAS' expert) found this conclusion questionable and thought that it was more likely that Jihadi groups and Al Quade were guilty. In any event \u2013 he insisted \u2013 all these militant groups are well-trained and battle-hardened. They maintain their own training camps, insurgency and they acquired an array of weaponry from North Africa's fallen regimes; and as far as Jama'at Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis is concerned, this group has claimed responsibility for lethal raids and rocket attacks on Israel among other attacks. Mr. Pelham insisted that, whoever was responsible, it would not be a primitive group.*\n\n*808. As regards the degree of violence used in the attacks against the Pipeline, Mr. Pelham recognised that attacks \"only\" involved the direct use of explosive devices and, as compared to other targets of Jihadi militants (such as the MFO), no violent crowd was present, nor were Molotov cocktails used.*\n\n*809. Mr. Schrader also underlined that there is no evidence that attackers were heavily armed and there would not even be a need for the use of strong weapons, as none of the attackers was ever challenged.270*\n\nICC Award, paras. 759-809. Internal citations omitted.\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that nearly all of the expert reports relied on by the parties in the ICC proceedings are in the record of the present arbitration as shown in the table below.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Claimant EMG** | **Issue** | **On the record of this arbitration at:** |\n| Mr. Charles C.

On the basis of this evaluation, the present Tribunal is satisfied that the findings of fact of the ICC tribunal set out above are correct and it so finds.\n\n***(e)***  ***Whether the Respondent has breached the Full protection & Security Standard***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine whether the Respondent acted diligently in preventing the attacks on the Trans-Sinai pipeline and repairing the damage caused to the pipeline.\n\n284.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal acknowledges that the circumstances in the North Sinai Egypt were difficult in the wake of the Arab Spring Revolution. Armed militant groups took advantage of the political instability, security deterioration and general lawlessness that ensued in the North Sinai273 to perpretate the attacks on the Trans-Sinai Pipeline.\n\nSee Expert Report of Major-General (Ret.) Warren J. Whiting, paras. 1-31.\n\n285.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal is of the view that the first attack on 5 February 2011 could not have been prevented by the Respondent and cannot amount to a breach of the full protection and security standard in itself. As Sole Arbitrator Paulsson said in *Pantechniki* : \"*[\u2026] it seems difficult to maintain that a government incurs international responsibility for failure to plan for unprecedented trouble of unprecented magnitude in unprecedented places.*\"274\n\n*Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, **RLA-168**, para 77.\n\n286.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers the thirteen attacks that were perpertrated on the Trans-Sinai Pipeline as a whole in determining whether the Respondent has breached the standard of full protection and security under the Treaty.\n\n287.\n\nIt is apparent to the Tribunal that, when considering the totality of these attacks, a certain pattern emerges: an attack is perpetrated, to which GASCO reacts months later and then adopts some measures to heighten the security of the pipeline, those measures are seldom implemented (or there is no evidence on the record that they were), another attack happens, and so on.\n\n288.\n\nThe failure by State security forces in the Northern Sinai to take any steps to stop saboteurs from damaging the lifeline of the Claimants' investment, whether preventive or reactive, is revealed by EGPC/EGAS's technical report on the 12 July 2011 attack (attack no. 5): the report describes how, as the attack was unfolding, EGAS personnel made contact with an Egyptian army patrol and asked them to stop saboteurs from laying explosives on the pipeline at a facility just 1.5 kilometers away from where the patrol was stationed. The Egyptian security forces refused to mobilize. Some 40 minutes later, the explosives were detonated.275 Gas supply to EMG was cut-off for almost three months thereafter.\n\n**C-206**.\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the first four attacks had been carried out on the facilities between February and July 2011. Clearly, these four first attacks should have been seen as a warning to the Egyptian State that further attacks might be carried out if security measures were not taken and implemented.\n\n290.\n\nIt is thus clear to the Tribunal that the failure by the Egyptian authorities to take any concrete steps to protect the Claimants' investment from damage in reaction to third party attacks on the upstream pipeline system, as of the date of attack no. 5, to wit 12 July 2011, constitutes a breach of the obligation of due diligence that Egypt was required to exercise in ensuring the full protection and security of the Claimants' investment.\n\n291.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's finding of a breach by the Respondent of the full protection and security standard and for the sake of procedural economy, the Tribunal need not analyse whether the delivery failures from 1 February 2011 to 9 May 2012 are in breach of the FET standard or the umbrella clause under the Treaty or whether they constitute an unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' investment under Treaty.\n\n**3. Delivery Failures following the Termination of the GSPA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a)***  ***Introduction***\n-----------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, it concluded as follows in respect of the Respondent's objection *ratione materiae* in relation to the Claimants' Gas Supply Dispute:\n\n*249. Essentially, as was seen above, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Gas Supply Dispute falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the CRCICA Tribunal which has upheld its jurisdiction.*\n\n*250. The CRCICA Tribunal, avers the Respondent, is considering the same issues* *\"which the Claimants seek to disguise as violations of the Treaties in these proceedings.\"*\n\n*251. Since the Gas Supply Dispute \"is purely contractual in nature\", the Respondent concludes that it falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause in Article VII of the US-Egypt Treaty.*\n\n*252. In response, as noted above, the Claimants assert that all of their claims in the present arbitration are based on their contention that Egypt has breached the US-Egypt Treaty and international law.*\n\n*253. Quoting from the Decision on Annulment of the Vivendi Committee, the* *Claimants say \"[i]t is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction \u2026 and* *another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether* *there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law.\"*\n\n*254. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants.*\n\n*255. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants claim breaches of various standards under the Treaty in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute, including fair and equitable treatment, unlawful expropriation and breach of the umbrella clause.* *As to the first two standards, the Tribunal accepts that, in order for it to find that there has been a breach of those standards in relation to the Gas Supply Dispute, it will need to determine as an incidental question whether the Source* *GSPA was validly terminated. However, this does not change the fact that the key issue under the Treaty in respect of a claim for unlawful expropriation or breach of the fair and equitable treatment is whether there has been a loss of property right constituted by the contract or whether legitimate expectations arose under the contract.*\n\n*256.*  *As to the umbrella clause, the Tribunal notes that there is no umbrella clause in the US Treaty and that it is invoked by the Claimants as having been introduced on the basis of the MFN clause in the Treaty. For purposes of its present decision on jurisdiction, the Tribunal need not determine today whether it has jurisdiction over such a clause. In due course, the question may become otiose.*\n\n*257. Accordingly,*  *the Respondent's objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Claimants' Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the standards of fair and equitable treatment and unlawful expropriation is dismissed. The Tribunal remains seized of the Respondent's objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Claimants' Gas Supply claims based on the alleged breach of the umbrella clause* *.* (Tribunal's emphasis)\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal recorded at paragraph 232 of its Decision on Jurisdiction that the Gas Supply Dispute covers, *inter alia*, \"the repudiation of gas supply obligations\"276:\n\nSee para. 232 (vi) of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n294.\n\nIn light of its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal will first determine, as an incidental question to the alleged Treaty breaches, whether the Source GSPA was validly terminated.\n\n***(b)***  ***Relevant provisions of the GSPA***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below the relevant provisions of the GSPA in respect of termination.\n\n296.\n\nArticle 2.5.2 of Annex 1 to the GSPA provides:\n\n*In the event that Buyer fails to timely pay any amounts due under this Agreement for four (4) consecutive Months, Seller shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement upon delivery of written notice to Buyer, provided that such failure shall not create the right to terminate this Agreement unless Buyer fails to cure such failure within thirty (30) Business Days after receiving notice from Seller of the fourth (4th) consecutive occurrence of such non-payment.*\n\n297.\n\nSection 6.8 of Annex 1 to the GSPA provides:\n\n*6.8 Daily Delivery Failure.*\n\n*6.8.1 To the extent that Seller fails to deliver during any Day during the Supply Period the aggregate of the Properly Nominated Quantities for such Day (other than in circumstances which Seller is excused pursuant to this Agreement) (\"****Daily Delivery Failure****\"), the quantity of Gas attributable to the Daily Delivery Failure that is greater than an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the aggregate Properly Nominated Quantity for that Day shall be classified as \"****Daily Shortfall Gas***.\"\n\n*6.8.2 If and to the extent that a Daily Delivery Failure is agreed by the Parties in writing or decided pursuant to Article 16 of Annex 1 to have been due to an event of Force Majeure affecting Seller, the corresponding quantity of Gas that was classified as Daily Shortfall Gas shall no longer be so classified. In those circumstances, Seller shall make the necessary adjustment in the next Annual Statement following that agreement or decision so as to adjust any amounts previously credited to Buyer under this Section 6.8 of Annex 1, together with interest on the adjustment amount at a rate equal to the Agreed Interest Rate plus three (3) percentage point (compounded annually) from the Annual Statement Due Date in respect of the Annual Statement for the Contract Year in which the Daily Delivery Failure occurred.*\n\n*6.8.3 In respect of any Daily Shortfall Gas in a Delivery Month, the Monthly Payment* *(as described in Section 9.3.2 of this Annex 1) for such Contract Year shall be reduced* *by an amount (the \"****Daily Shortfall Compensation****\") equal to the sum of:*\n\n*(a) with respect to each On-Sale Agreement in force during such Delivery Month, ten percent (10%) of the product of (i) the amount of the Daily Shortfall Gas attributable to such On-Sale Agreement for each Day during which there was a Daily Delivery Failure during such Delivery Month, multiplied by (ii) the then applicable Contract Price with respect to such On-Sale Agreement (for purposes of Section 6.8.3(a)(i) of this Annex 1, Daily Shortfall Gas shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all On-Sale Agreements with respect to which there have been nominations for delivery of Gas on the Day that such Daily Delivery Failure occurred based on the respective nominations for such On-Sale Agreements for such Day); and*\n\n*(b) any costs, expenses or penalties incurred by an On-Sale Customer under a* *Transportation Agreement payable by Buyer (or Buyer's Affiliate) where Buyer can demonstrate that such cost, expense, or penalty resulted from Seller's Daily Delivery* *Failure; and*\n\n*6.8.4 For the sole purpose of calculating any Daily Shortfall Gas in respect of a Day* *during periods of permitted Seller's Scheduled Maintenance or Seller's Unscheduled* *Maintenance, the aggregate of the Properly Nominated Quantities for such Day shall* *be deemed to be the lesser of the aggregate of Buyer's actual Properly Nominated* *Quantities for such Day and the aggregate of the maximum hourly quantities of Gas that Seller anticipated Seller could deliver during each Hour of such Day pursuant to* *Seller's notice to Buyer in accordance with Section 5.2 of this Annex 1.*\n\n298.\n\nSection 6.9 of Annex 1 to the GSPA provides:\n\n*6.9 Monthly Delivery Failure.*\n\n*6.9.1 To the extent that Seller fails to deliver during any Month during the Supply* *Period the Properly Nominated Quantities on a Day-by-Day basis for such Month (other than in circumstances which Seller is excused pursuant to this Agreement)* *(\"Monthly Delivery Failure\") the aggregate quantity of Gas that Seller fails to deliver on a Day-by-Day basis during such Delivery Month shall be classified as \"Monthly* *Shortfall Gas.\" Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Seller fails to deliver a* *Properly Nominated Quantity on a given Day, if Seller, on or before 18:00 on the Day immediately following the Day of such failure, notifies Buyer that Seller shall make such undelivered Gas available to Buyer within three Days after the Day that Seller failed to deliver, and Seller actually delivers such Gas to Buyer on the date so notified (and within such three Day period), the amount of such Gas so delivered shall reduce the aggregate amount of Monthly Shortfall Gas.*\n\n*6.9.2 If and to the extent that a Monthly Delivery Failure is agreed by the Parties in writing or decided pursuant to Article 16 of Annex 1 to have been due to an event of Force Majeure affecting Seller, the corresponding quantity of Gas that was classified as Monthly Shortfall Gas shall no longer be so classified. In those circumstances, Seller shall make the necessary adjustment in the next Annual Statement following that agreement or decision so as to adjust any amounts previously paid (or credited) to Buyer under this Section 6.9 of Annex 1, together with interest on the adjustment amount at a rate equal to the Agreed Interest Rate plus three (3) percentage point (compounded annually) from the Annual Statement Due Date in respect of the Annual Statement for the Contract Year in which the Monthly Delivery Failure occurred.*\n\n*6.9.3 To the extent that the Monthly Delivery Failure in any Delivery Month attributable to the Initial On-Sale Agreement is greater than seven percent (7%) of the aggregate Properly Nominated Quantities for such Delivery Month for the Initial On-Sale Agreement, in addition to any Daily Shortfall Compensation payable pursuant to Section 6.8.3 of Annex 1 with respect to such quantities of Q1 and in addition to the re-delivery obligations of Seller set forth in Section 6.9.5, Buyer shall be entitled to receive an amount (the \"Monthly Shortfall Compensation\") equal to the product of (a) ten percent (10%), multiplied by (b) the amount of the Monthly Shortfall Gas attributable to the Initial On-Sale Agreement during such Delivery Month, multiplied by (c) the then applicable Contract Price with respect to the Initial On-Sale Agreement. For purposes of this Section 6.9.3, Monthly Delivery Failure and Monthly Shortfall Gas shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among all On-Sale Agreements with respect to which there have been nominations for delivery of Gas during the Delivery Month during which such Monthly Delivery Failure occurred based on the respective nominations for such On-Sale Agreements for such Month.*\n\n*6.9.4 Buyer shall deduct any Monthly Shortfall Compensation payable by Seller pursuant to Section 6.9.3 of Annex 1 from the Monthly Payment (as described in Section 9.3.2 of this Annex 1) for such Delivery Month.*\n\n*6.9.5 To the extent that there is a Monthly Delivery Failure in respect of any Delivery Month, Seller shall be obligated to deliver such Monthly Shortfall Gas in accordance with the following procedures:*\n\n*(a) Within thirty (30) days following the Delivery Month in which the Monthly Delivery Failure occurred, the Parties, acting in good faith, will agree on the delivery schedule of such Monthly Shortfall Gas; such delivery schedule shall provide for the delivery of all such Monthly Shortfall Gas within a period of 180 days following the last day of the Delivery Month during which the Monthly Delivery Failure occurred.*\n\n*(b) The delivery of such Monthly Shortfall Gas shall be in addition to the other delivery obligations of Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall pay no additional amounts for such Gas other than the applicable Contract Price for such Gas in effect during the Delivery Month in which the Monthly Delivery Failure occurred.*\n\n*(c) To the extent that Seller makes available quantities of Monthly Shortfall Gas in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.9.5, any Daily Shortfall Compensation previously deducted by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.8.3(a) of Annex 1, and any Monthly Shortfall Compensation previously deducted by Buyer pursuant to Sections 6.9.3 and 6.9.4 of Annex 1, attributable to such quantities of Monthly Shortfall Gas shall be paid by Buyer to Seller, such payment to be made within thirty* *(30) days following the end of the Month during which such deliveries of Monthly Shortfall Gas occurred.*\n\n*6.9.6 For the sole purpose of calculating any Monthly Shortfall Gas in respect of periods of permitted Seller's Scheduled Maintenance or Seller's Unscheduled Maintenance, the aggregate of the Properly Nominated Quantities for each Day during such Delivery Month shall be deemed to be the lesser of the aggregate of Buyer's actual Properly Nominated Quantities for such Day and the aggregate of the maximum hourly quantities of Gas that Seller anticipated Seller could deliver during each Hour of such Day pursuant to Seller's notice to Buyer in accordance with Section 5.2 of this Annex 1.*\n\n299.\n\nSection 9.3.2 of Annex 1 to the GSPA provides:\n\n*Monthly Payment. On or before the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after Buyer's receipt by facsimile of Seller's Monthly Invoice (the \"Monthly Payment Due Date\") Buyer shall pay Seller the \"Monthly Payment\", which is an amount equal to*\n\n*(a) the total quantity of Gas taken by Buyer during the Delivery Month multiplied by* *(ii) the applicable Contract Price;*\n\n*Except\\_for reasons of Force Majeure,* *less the aggregate of:*\n\n*(b) the Daily Shortfall Compensation for such Delivery Month;*\n\n*(c) Payments due to Buyer during the Delivery Month from Seller as a result of Seller's failure to begin deliveries as set forth in Sections 4.5 and 4.6;*\n\n*(d) Payments due to Buyer during the Delivery Month from Seller as a result of Seller's delivery of Off-Specification Gas during such Delivery Month, as set forth in Sections 8.4 and 8.5;*\n\n*(e) any other amounts due to Buyer from Seller during such delivery Month.*\n\n300.\n\nSection 9.4.7 of Annex 1 to the GSPA provides:\n\n*Disputed Invoices. If a Party has a bona fide dispute with respect to any sum shown in any invoice (or accompanying statement) as being payable by that Party, then such Party*  *shall* *(i) pay in full all of the undisputed amount shown in such invoice on or before the relevant due date, (ii) promptly give notice to the other Party of the amount in dispute and the reasons therefore, (iii) in such notice, inform the other Party whether the Party disputing such amount intends to pay such disputed amount pending resolution of such dispute (in which case such disputed amount shall be paid together with the payment of any undisputed amount), or withhold payment of the disputed amount pending resolution of the dispute. The Parties shall seek to settle the disputed amount as soon as reasonably practicable. Any disputed amount agreed or determined, pursuant to Article 14 to be not payable by the Party disputing such amount shall (to the extent that such disputing Party previously paid such disputed amount) shall be re-paid by the other Party to the disputing Party (such amount to be included in the Monthly Invoice or Annual Statement, as applicable, next following such agreement or determination, together with the interest on such amount at a rate equal to the Agreed Interest Rate plus three percent (3%) (compounded annually)* *from the date when such payment was due until and including the date when the disputed amount was settled or decided pursuant to Article 14. Any disputed amounts agreed or determined, pursuant to Article 14, to be payable by the Party disputing such amount shall be retained by the other Party if the disputing Party previously paid such disputed amount, or (to the extent that such disputing Party elected not to pay such disputed amount) shall be paid by the disputing Party to the other Party (such amount to be included in the Monthly Invoice or Annual Statement, as applicable, next following such agreed or determination, together with interest on such amount at a rate equal to the Agreed Interest Rate plus three percent (3%) (compounded annually) from the date when such payment was due until and including the date when the disputed amount was settled or decided pursuant to Article 14.*\n\n301.\n\nArt. 16.3 Annex 1 to the GSPA defines \"*force majeure*\" as follows:\n\n*[it] means an event or circumstance which is beyond the control of the Party concerned (acting and having acted as a Reasonable and Prudent Person), resulting in or causing the delay or the failure by such Party to perform all or any of its obligations under this Agreement (including, in the case of Buyer, the inability to take delivery of any Properly Nominated Quantity of Gas and in the case of Seller, the inability to deliver the Properly Nominated Quantities of Gas), which delay or failure could not have been prevented or overcome by the standard of a Reasonable and Prudent Person.*\n\n302.\n\nA reasonable and prudent person is defined in Annex 6 to the GSPA as follows:\n\n*A Person seeking in good faith to perform its contractual obligations and in so doing and in the general conduct of its undertaking exercising that degree of skill, prudence, diligence and foresight that would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a skilled and experienced Person complying with Law engaged in the same type of undertaking under the same or similar circumstances and conditions.*\n\n303.\n\nThe requirement to act with this standard of diligence is developed in Art. 16.2 of Annex 1 to the GSPA as follows:\n\n*A Party claiming force majeure must act as a Reasonable and Prudent Person in preventing the effects of any force majeure events (and as soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of an event of force majeure, a Party claiming force majeure must act as a Reasonable and Prudent Person to overcome and mitigate the effects of such event of force majeure), and shall continue to perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent such obligations are not impacted by such force majeure events. To the extent a Party claiming force majeure fails to act as a Reasonable and Prudent Person in preventing or mitigating the effects of any force majeure events, such Party shall not be excused for any delay or failure to perform that would have been avoided if such Party had acted as a Reasonable and Prudent Person.*\n\n304.\n\nArt. 16.7 of Annex 1 to the GSPA imposes an obligation to remedy:\n\n*Force majeure relief will cease to be available to the affected Party in the event of a failure to take all reasonable steps to remedy the failure as soon as practicable.*\n\n305.\n\nAnd 16.8 of Annex 1 to the GSPA provides the following notification requirement:\n\n*Notice of force majeure: In the event of a force majeure, the affected Party will serve notice of such force majeure to the other Party as soon as is reasonably practicable, promptly provide a report of the circumstances of such force majeure, providing all relevant information as is available as to such event (including the Place thereof, the reasons for failure and the reasons why such Party's obligations under this Agreement were affected), and from time to time, provide updates of such event, including further information and explanation as it becomes available.*\n\n***(c)***  ***Parties' positions***\n-----------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nEGAS terminated the GSPA pursuant to Article 2.5.2 of Annex 1 to the GSPA on 25 April 2012. On 9 May 2012, EMG accepted EGAS's repudiation of the GSPA and elected to seek damages in the ICC arbitration.\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is common ground between the Parties that failure to pay the Seller's invoices for four consecutive months justifies a termination under Article 2.5.2.277 It is also common ground between the Parties that, in the event of a failure to pay, EGAS must send a written notice to EMG and that, if EMG does not cure its failure within 30 Business Days, EGAS can terminate the GSPA.\n\nTr. Day 9, 72:2-10, 72:23-73:2.\n\n308.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, EMG failed to pay the invoices for the months of January to April 2011. In fact, asserts the Respondent, EMG failed to pay for gas that it received and sold onwards even after April 2011, and defaulted in respect of many other obligations under the GSPA, such as its obligation to pay part of the Provisional Credit.278\n\nTr. Day 9, 165:12-166:18; R's Closing, v. I, 76.\n\n309.\n\nIn respect of the months of January to April 2011, the Respondent maintains that the following facts are uncontested.\n\n(i) During those months, EGAS delivered gas to EMG and issued invoices279, however, EMG did not pay any of these invoices in full when they became due280 despite selling the gas onwards to its On-Sale Customers and receiving payment for the gas.\n\n(ii) As a result, EGAS notified EMG that it would terminate the GSPA pursuant to Section 2.5.2 on 24 August 2011.281\n\n(iii) By 11 October 2011, 30 Business Days after EGAS's written notice, EMG had not made any payment of the amounts it owed.\n\n(iv) Over the following six months, EGAS provided EMG with five opportunities to cure its default.282\n\n(v) By April 2012, EMG had not paid for any of the invoices issued between January 2011 through March 2012, except for the principal amount of the January 2011 invoice and a partial payment of the February 2011 invoice, almost a year late in each case.283\n\n(vi) EGAS sent EMG a letter on 19 April 2012, stating that it was exercising its right to terminate the GSPA under Section 2.5.2.284\n\n(vii) On 9 May 2012, EMG wrote to EGAS stating that it terminated the GSPA at common law, reasoning that EGAS has committed a repudiatory breach of the GSPA.\n\nInvoices from EGPC and EGAS to EMG for gas delivered from January to April 2011 (**R-348** to **R-354**).\n\nNBE Bank Transfers of 10 April 2011 (**C-584, 585**) and 27 June 2011 (**C-597**).\n\nLetter from EGPC and EGAS to EMG dated 24 August 2011 (**C-85**).\n\nThese are letters dated 13 October 2011 (**R-301**), 24 October 2011 (**R-304**), 15 November 2011 (**R-307**), 18 December 2011 (re extension of deadline for payment) (**R-314**) and 31 January 2012 (**C-214**).\n\nSee Credit Note of US$ 10,000,000.00 dated 5 January 2012 (**R-411**); Credit Note of US$ 1,906,584.91 dated 31 January 2012 (**R-413**); Credit Note of US$ 60,284.25 dated 31 January 2012 (**R-412**).\n\nLetter from EGPC and EGAS to EMG dated 18 April 2012 (**C-92**).\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimants contest that any amount was due to EGAS for the month of February 2011.\n\n311.\n\nAt the outset, the Claimants submit that EMG does not have to dispute an invoice EGAS sent to it, because invoices do not give rise to an obligation to pay pursuant to Article 9.4.7 of Annex 1 to the GSPA and relies on the expert evidence of Sir Bernard Rix on English law in support of its argument.285\n\nEnglish law is the applicable law to the GSPA.\n\n312.\n\nUnder Sir Bernard's construction of Article 9.4.7, a Party which does not dispute an invoice under 9.4.7(ii), is not under an obligation to pay the undisputed amount under 9.4.7(i).286 The Party receiving the invoice could dispute it by doing nothing287, so that it would be for the other Party (the Seller in the case of monthly invoices) to find out if the Buyer is actually disputing the invoice or not.288 In answer to a question from the President, Sir Bernard confirmed that even if the Buyer failed to dispute an invoice under 9.4.7, that would not \"*change* [] *the amounts that are due*\" for purposes of Article 2.5.2.289\n\nTr. Day 4, 188:6-24.\n\nTr. Day 4, 191:9-20.\n\nTr. Day 4, 155:20-156:15.\n\nTr. Day 4, 214:3-24, 216:16-20.\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent and its expert on English law, Lord Hoffmann, interpret Article 9.4.7 differently. Under Lord Hoffmann's construction of 9.4.7, once a Party receives an invoice, which is a claim for what is due290, that Party has an obligation to (i) pay in full whatever amount it does not dispute; or, (ii) give notice to dispute the amount of the invoice it does not agree with, giving reasons for its dispute. For a dispute under 9.4.7 (ii), the criteria of that provision must be met: a general allegation of dispute between the Parties will not suffice, and neither will doing nothing.291\n\nTr. Day 6, 24:4-14, 26:19-24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 71.\n\n314.\n\nBoth Lord Hoffmann and Sir Bernard agree, however, that the use of the term \"*shall*\" in Article 9.4.7 is mandatory, and that it triggers an obligation to pay any undisputed amount shown as being payable in an invoice.292\n\nTr. Day 6, 62:21-63:12; Tr. Day 4, 194:3-23, 194:24-195:10.\n\n315.\n\nIf the Tribunal adopts Lord Hoffman's construction of Article 9.4.7, the Respondent submits that since EMG did not challenge the February 2011 invoice it was obliged to pay it.\n\n316.\n\nIf the Tribunal adopts Sir Bernard Rix's construction, the Claimants submit that since they disputed the February invoice by rejecting EGPC/EGAS' *force majeure* claim in respect of the 5 February 2011 attack, the balance of payment for the month of February 2011 under Article 9.3.2 was in EMG's favour and thus no amount was due from EMG to EGPC/EGAS.293 Accordingly, assert the Claimants, this deprived EGPC/EGAS of any entitlement to terminate the Source GSPA.\n\nReply, para. 105.\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimants argue that:\n\n*Articles 6.8 and 6.9 of Annex 1 to the Source GSPA expressly provided that shortfall compensation would continue to accrue*  *regardless of any claim of force majeure,*  *pending agreement of the parties or an arbitral decision. Once agreement was reached or a tribunal confirmed the force majeure entitlement, EGPC/EGAS would then be credited for any shortfall penalties for which it was not liable. In the meantime,*  *shortfall penalties were incorporated into the Monthly Payment calculation described in Article 9.3.2 for purposes of determining the amounts due under the Source GSPA* *. No agreement was ever reached between the parties, and arbitral proceedings under the Source GSPA are still pending. EGPC/EGAS therefore had no entitlement to terminate the Source GSPA.294 (Tribunal's emphasis)*\n\nReply, para. 106.\n\n318.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Egypt miscontrues the clear wording of Articles 6.8 and 6.9, and the equally clear consequences of those provisions for the calculation of \"amounts due\" under Article 9.3.2. According to the Claimants, Article 9.3.2 alone determines the \"amounts due\" on a monthly basis.\n\n319.\n\nEgypt and Lord Hoffmann take the view that a failure to dispute a Monthly Invoice issued under Article 9.3.1 using the procedures established in Article 9.4.7, constitutes an independent ground for creating an \"amount due\" for a given month, and that it is Article 9.4.7, not 9.3.2, under which it is due. The Claimants assert that Article 9.4.7 cannot itself create any \"amount due\", let alone do so on a monthly basis. It must be read in the context of Article 9.4 and the Source GSPA more generally.295\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 66.\n\n320.\n\nThe Claimants recall that on several occasions EMG requested additional information, as necessary to evaluate the February 2011 *force majeure* declaration.296 They say that the information received in April 2011 was inadequate, and that EMG registered its complaint in this regard.297 When EMG attempted to calculate the Annual Statement in September 2011, it specifically reserved its rights with respect to the February 2011 *force majeure* claim.298 It subsequently paid the corresponding amounts under express protest.299\n\nLetter from EMG (A.

They include whether EMG paid the January 2011 invoice, whether EGPC/EGAS relied on their own wrong to invoke Article 2.5.2, and whether EGPC/EGAS terminated the GSPA in bad faith. In reaching its decision, the Tribunal has considered all of the Parties' arguments.\n\n***(d)***  ***Relevant Findings of the ICC Tribunal***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of the lawful or unlawful termination of the GSPA was reviewed at great length and determined by the ICC Tribunal in its Award of 4 December 2015.\n\n325.\n\nIn its Award, the ICC Tribunal clearly sided with Sir Bernard's interpretation of Article 9.4.7 of Annex 1 to the GSPA. It concluded:\n\n*1028. The Tribunal finds the following matters compelling:*\n\n*- The matters to be specified in a statement supporting a Monthly Invoice under Art. 9.3.1 differ in material respects from the elements to be taken into account in calculating the Monthly Payment under Art. 9.3.2;*\n\n*- The GSPA accords primacy to the Monthly Payment, in that the Monthly Payment is expressed to be the amount payable by EMG;*\n\n*- [\u2026] circumstances might well arise in which there was nothing to challenge in a Monthly Invoice even though the invoiced amount was greater, perhaps substantially greater, than the Monthly Payment, correctly calculated; in such circumstances, it would be surprising if EMG became bound to pay the greater amount, merely by reason of its failure to launch a challenge to an invoice that was unimpeachable;*\n\n*- It is necessary to bear in mind that the contractual provisions relating to monthly payments underpin the grounds for termination set out at Art. 2.5.2 of Annex 1;*\n\n*- On EGAS' case, the payment obligation at Art. 9.3.2 ceases to apply, being supplanted by an obligation to pay the amount claimed in a Monthly Invoice;*\n\n*- Annex 1 contains no wording, still less clear wording, to show that, in the absence of a challenge an invoiced amount becomes payable;*\n\n*- Similarly, there is no wording to show that the payment obligation at Art. 9.3.2 is supplanted.*\n\n*1029. Having regard to these matters, on this question the Tribunal prefers the arguments advanced on behalf of EMG and IEC. It holds that Art. 9.4.7 did not apply to Monthly Invoices issued pursuant to Art. 9.3.1.302*\n\nICC Award, paras. 1028 \u2013 1029.\n\n326.\n\nThe ICC tribunal found that Article 9.3.2 alone determines the \"amounts due\" to EGPC/EGAS on a monthly basis and that Article 9.4.7 did not apply to Monthly Invoices issued pursuant to Article 9.3.1.\n\n327.\n\nThe ICC tribunal also concluded that it was \"*satisfied that, even in a case of suspected or alleged force majeure, the deductions fall to be made, unless and until there is agreement or a determination to the effect that the force majeure provisions apply.*\"303\n\nICC Award, para. 1039.\n\n328.\n\nThe ICC Tribunal then continued its analysis as follows:\n\n*1064. The Tribunal must now decide whether EGAS' termination was prima facie lawful: had EMG failed to pay the amounts due for four consecutive months? EMG accepts that it owed amounts for the months of January, March and April 2011; but it denies that amounts were due for February 2011 \u2013 quite the contrary, EMG submits that for that month it was EGAS who owed EMG a sizeable amount.*\n\n*1065. Determination of how much was owed for February 2011 requires as a first step to decide whether EMG can be deemed to have recurrently nominated quantities during that month (A.) and, if so, how much gas was deemed nominated (B.) and whether such* *deemed nomination is in agreement with the maximum daily nominations admitted by the GSPA (C.). As a third step the Tribunal must establish the amount EGAS owed to EMG for that month as Shortfall Compensation (D.). Finally, the Tribunal will prepare a table with the balance due (E.) [\u2026]304*\n\nICC Award, paras. 1064 \u2013 1065.\n\n329.\n\nOn the basis of its calculation, the ICC tribunal ultimately concluded that EMG did not owe any amount to EGAS under the GSPA for February 2011 (in fact it was EGAS which owed money to EMG)305, and that consequently, EGAS' termination of the GSPA did not meet the requirement of Article 2.5.2. EGAS' purported termination of the GSPA on 18 April 2012 was thus unlawful.306\n\nICC Award, para. 1125.\n\nICC Award, para. 1203.\n\n330.\n\nThe ICC tribunal also found that EGAS could not invoke the *force majeure* defence. As a result, the deductions for the shortfall compensations it had applied could not be credited to EGPC/EGAS and its finding that EMG did not owe any amount to EGAS under the GSPA for the month of February 2011 was reiterated. The ICC Tribunal summarized its findings in respect of *force majeure* as follows:\n\n*1790. Between 5 February 2005 and 9 April 2012 the Pipeline was attacked 13 times, explosives were used to blow up the pipe or its facilities, the gas flow was interrupted while repairs were carried out, and EGAS stopped gas deliveries to EMG (and EMG to IEC). EGAS claims that the attacks on the Pipeline amounted to force majeure events, that the contractual requirements for that force majeure event to become a contractual remedy have been met, and that EGAS' failure to deliver is thereby justified.*\n\n*1791. The GSPA establishes two requirements for the availability of EGAS' force majeure defence:*\n\n*- the requirement that EGAS acted as a RPPO (i.e. as a Reasonable and Prudent Pipeline Operator) and*\n\n*- the so-called Avoidance Requirement: had EGAS acted as a RPPO the attacks could indeed have been mitigated or prevented.*\n\n*1792. After a detailed review of the evidence marshalled by the Parties, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion:*\n\n*- That EGAS has failed to prove that it acted as a RPPO in preventing and mitigating the effects of the attacks; in particular, it has failed to prove that it implemented security plans, provided physical security to the pipe, deployed technological detection devices, and retained proper security forces; and*\n\n*- That the evidence in the file indicates that the attacks initially against the facilities and afterwards against the pipe could have been avoided (or, at least, significantly mitigated) had EGAS acted as a RPPO and adopted the minimal standard security measures suggested by the counter-experts.*\n\n*1793. Consequently, the Tribunal dismissed the force majeure defence: EGAS' failure to perform and to deliver the contractually agreed quantities of gas cannot be excused. The Tribunal also dismissed all additional arguments and defences raised by EGAS relating to this issue.307*\n\nICC Award, paras. 1790-1793. Internal citations omitted.\n\n331.\n\nFor the reasons which it explained earlier, these findings of the ICC tribunal on contractual matters within its mandate are *res judicata* between the Parties to the present proceedings who are in privity of interest with the Parties to the ICC Award.\n\n332.\n\nNevertheless, independently of this finding, the present Tribunal has also conducted its own evaluation of the evidence presented to it about the same factual matters. On the basis of this evaluation, the Tribunal is satisfied that the findings of fact of the ICC tribunal set out above are correct and it so finds.\n\n333.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that EGPC/EGAS have wrongfully terminated the GSPA.\n\n***(e)***  ***Whether the termination of the GSPA is tantamount to an expropriation***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that EGPC/EGAS have wrongfully terminated the GSPA and that EGPC/EGAS' termination of the GSPA is attributable to the Respondent.308\n\nSee *supra*, paras 142-146.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal needs to determine now whether the wrongful termination of the GSPA constitutes an unlawful expropriation under the Treaty which gives rise to a claim for damages by the Claimants against the Respondent.\n\n336.\n\nAs is well known, a State may breach a contract without breaching a Treaty and vice versa. In the words of the Annulment Committee in the Vivendi case:\n\n*[W]hether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions.* *Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law \u2013 in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract by the proper law of the contract [\u2026]309*\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (**RLA-136**), \u00b6\u00b6 95-96 (emphasis added).\n\n337.\n\nThe first question which arises for the Tribunal is whether the Claimants' property interest in the GSPA constitutes an investment under the Treaty.\n\n338.\n\nThe term \"investment\" is defined in Article I of the Treaty as follows:\n\n*\"Investment\" means*  *every kind of asset* *owned or controlled and includes but is not limited to:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares, stock, or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) valid intellectual and industrial rights property, including, but not limited to rights with respect to copyrights and related patents, trade marks and trade names, industrial designs, trade secrets and know-how, and goodwill.*\n\n*(v) licenses and permits issued pursuant to law, including those issued for manufacture and sale of products.*\n\n*(vi)*  *any right conferred by* *law or*  *contract,* *but not limited to rights within the confines of law to search for or utilize natural resources, and rights to manufacture, use and sell products;*\n\n*(vii) returns which are reinvested.310*\n\nTribunal's emphasis.\n\n339.\n\nClearly, the Claimants' rights conferred by the GSPA constitute an investment which is protected under the Treaty. This does not appear to be contested by the Respondent.\n\n340.\n\nDid the Respondent, by wrongfully terminating the GSPA, expropriate the Claimants' investment?\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article III(1) of the US Treaty provides:\n\n*No investment or any part of an investment of a national or company of either Party shall be expropriated or nationalized by the other Party or by a subdivision thereof \u2013 or subjected to any other measure, direct or indirect, if the effect of such other measures, or a series of such measures, would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (all expropriations, all nationalizations and all such other measures hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") \u2013 unless the expropriation*\n\n*(a) Is done for a public purpose;*\n\n*(b) Is accomplished under due process of law;*\n\n*(c) Is not discriminatory;*\n\n*(d) Is accompanied by prompt and adequate compensation, freely realizable; and*\n\n*(e) Does not violate any specific contractual engagement.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n342.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that the Respondent has breached all the conditions set out in this Article III(1) of the Treaty and the expropriation is thus unlawful.\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the Respondent's termination of the GSPA was a disproportionate act by Egypt that neutralized their investment and is thus tantamount to an indirect expropriation.311 They write that, although, as the Respondent avers, they do retain control of their shares in EMG, which continues to own the pipeline and has the right to recover damages for breach of contract, their investment \"has come to an end\"312 and they have never been compensated for that *de facto* expropriation.313\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 495.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 498.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 502.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the termination of the GSPA was a disproportionate act. As already determined, the termination was wrongful and the GSPA was terminated for the non-payment of US$37 million allegedly due314 \u2013 a very relatively small amount having regard to the potential economic benefits to Egypt and EMG's investors (which include EGPC) which amount to billions of dollars. In addition, EGPC/EGAS terminated the GSPA at a time when many in Egypt voiced strong opposition to the supply of gas to Israel315.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 575.\n\nSee People's Assembly 2012, First ordinary Session, Minutes of the Thirty-Fourth Meeting on 12 March 2012, Official Journal, No. 34, 8 May 2012, **C-217**.\n\n345.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that the termination of the GSPA destroyed the Claimants' investment activity.\n\n346.\n\nIt is well settled that the \"irreparable cessation\" of an investment activity caused by the disproportionate act of a State is tantamount to an expropriation.316\n\nSee *Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd. v. Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana* (UNCITRAL) Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 27 October 1989, **CLA-79**, pp. 207-210 (finding that failure to award a construction permit to a local-operating entity in contravention of the investor's justified reliance on host State representations constituted a constructive expropriation because it resulted in the \"irreparable cessation\" of investment activity). See also *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1) Award, 30 August 2000, **CLA-43**, paras 107-108; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, **CLA-47**, paras. 7.5.26-7.5.28, 7.5.33.\n\n347.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' property interest in the GSPA has been unlawfully expropriated by the Respondent.\n\n348.\n\nHaving found that the wrongful termination of the GSPA by the Respondent is tantamount to an expropriation, the Tribunal need not determine whether the termination constitutes a breach of the FET standard or the umbrella clause317.\n\nIn respect of the umbrella clause, the Tribunal recalls para. 256 of its Decision on Jurisdiction where it concluded that:\n\n*256. As to the umbrella clause, the Tribunal notes that there is no umbrella clause in the US Treaty and that it is invoked by the Claimants as having been introduced on the basis of the MFN clause in the Treaty. For purposes of its present decision on jurisdiction, the Tribunal need not determine today whether it has jurisdiction over such a clause. In due course, the question may become otiose.*  \n This question has indeed become otiose.\n\n**VII. HEADS OF LOSS**\n----------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Claimants modified their claim for damages after the Decision on Jurisdiction and Ampal's election. They now claim US$635 million detailed as follows318:\n\n**Summary of aggregate losses now claimed in the ICSID arbitration, including interest and value leakage (US$million) and as adjusted to remove David Fischer's claim and reduce Ampal's claim in accordance with its election**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Claimants** | **Impact of** **Tax Exemption Revocation (until 2025**) | **Impact of** **Tax Exemption Revocation**  **(beyond** **2025)** | **Impact of the First Amendment** | **Impact of the Delivery Failures** | **Total** **Losses (excl. Interest)** | **Interest** **to** **11 April** **2014** | **Total** **losses** **(incl.** **interest)** |\n| EGI Fund | 29.4 | 6.2 | 71.7 | 69.2 | 176.5 | 33.3 | 209.7 |\n| EGI Series | 0.0 | 0.0 | 78.2 | 75.5 | 153.7 | 25.0 | 178.7 |\n| BSS | 4.9 | 1.0 | 13.0 | 12.6 | 31.6 | 5.9 | 37.5 |\n| Ampal | 48.5 | 10.3 | 129.3 | 126.1 | 314.2 | 58.6 | 372.8 |\n| **Total** | **82.8** | **17.5** | **220.6** | **214.2** | **535.1** | **99.9** | **635.0** |\n\nSee Annex B to the Claimants' letter of 28 June 2016.\n\n350.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal, in the present Decision, has concluded that:\n\n(a) the Claimants' property interest in the tax license was unlawfully expropriated by the Respondent by the enactment of Law 114/2008 on 5 May 2008 and that the Claimants should be compensated for this unlawful expropriation up until the year 2025 (and not beyond);\n\n(b) the Claimants were not coerced into signing the First Amendment and are therefore not entitled to any compensation in relation to this head of loss;\n\n(c) the Claimants have not succeeded in their claim of losses attributable to delivery failures between July 2009 and February 2011;\n\n(d) by failing to protect the Trans-Sinai pipeline, the Respondent breached the standard of full protection and security under the Treaty and the Claimants should be compensated for this breach as of attack no. 5 (12 July 2011); and\n\n(e) the Claimants' property interest in its shares in EMG was unlawfully expropriated by the Respondent by the wrongful termination of the GSPA on 9 May 2012 and the Claimants should be compensated for this breach.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal must now determine the quantum of the damages to which the Claimants are entitled as a result of the breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent which it has found in the present Decision.\n\n352.\n\nEssentially, the Tribunal's task in the quantum phase of the present arbitration is to establish the fair market value (as opposed to ownership value)319 of the Claimants' shareholdings in EMG.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that establishing the fair market value of the Claimants' shareholding in EMG is consistent with the compensation framework established by the Treaty under which the Claimants are not entitled to compensation that exceeds the \"fair market value\" of their investment.\n\n353.\n\nIn a separate procedural order to be issued by 24 February 2017, the Tribunal will issue directions to the Parties' experts to assist the Tribunal in the determination of the Claimants' damages based on specific parameters.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n354.\n\nHaving carefully considered the parties' arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions, and having deliberated, for the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(a) To the extent relevant to the claims before the Tribunal, EGPC/EGAS's acts are attributable to the Respondent;\n\n(b) The Respondent breached Article III(1) of the Treaty by expropriating the Claimants' property interest in EMG's tax license on 5 May 2008;\n\n(c) The Respondent breached Article II(4) of the Treaty by failing to protect the Claimants' investment as of 12 July 2011;\n\n(d) The Respondent breached Article III(1) of the Treaty by expropriating the Claimants' investment in EMG on 9 May 2012;\n\n(e) Dismisses the Parties' other claims in respect of liability; and\n\n(f) Reserves its decision as to quantum and costs."}]}
