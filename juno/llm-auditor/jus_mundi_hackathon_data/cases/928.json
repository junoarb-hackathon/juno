PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nAguaytia Energy LLC, a company incorporated in the State of Delaware (U.S.A.), submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") a Request to Institute Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Request\") dated 8 May 2006 against the Republic of Peru.\n\n2.\n\nICSID registered the Request on 17 July 2006.\n\n3.\n\nThe Parties having been unable to agree on the number of arbitrators and the method for their appointment, and sixty days having elapsed since the registration of the Request, the Claimant, by letter of 20 September 2006, invoked the formula provided for in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the Convention\") pursuant to which:\n\n*Where the parties do not agree upon the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who shall be the president of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the parties.*\n\n4.\n\nIn the same letter, the Claimant appointed as Arbitrator, Mr. J. William Rowley QC (a national of Canada), and, by letter dated 13 October 2006, the Respondent appointed Dr. Claus von Wobeser (a national of Mexico) as Arbitrator.\n\n5.\n\nUpon the failure of the Parties to agree on a presiding arbitrator, the Claimant, by letter of 31 January 2007, requested that the appointment be made by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (\"Chairman\"), pursuant to Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\" or \"ICSID Rules\").\n\n6.\n\nFollowing consultation with the Parties, the Chairman appointed Dr. Robert Briner (a national of Switzerland) as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. By letter of 27 March 2007, the Centre noted that, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules, the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on 27 March 2007. Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was designated by ICSID as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 20 April 2007, ICSID informed the Arbitral Tribunal that due to the reorganization of the case management undertaken at the Centre, Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu had been replaced as Secretary of the Tribunal by Mr. Tomas Solis, Counsel, ICSID. Mr. Solis was in turn formally replaced by Ms. Natali Sequeira on 3 November 2008.\n\n8.\n\nA first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on 18 May 2007 at the World Bank offices in Washington D.C. A sound recording of the session was made.\n\nThe following persons were present:\n\n**The Arbitral Tribunal**\n\nDr. Robert Briner, President  \nMr. J.

At the end of the Hearing, the Parties and the Arbitrators stated that they had no further issues to discuss, and the Parties confirmed that they were in agreement with the procedure as conducted by the Arbitral Tribunal up to that time. The Tribunal thereupon invited the Parties to provide material comments regarding the Transcript of the Hearing within a time period of three weeks.\n\n28.\n\nBy its letter dated 14 August 2008 addressed to the Tribunal, the Claimant communicated its revisions to the Transcript and informed the Tribunal that the Respondent had agreed to the Claimant\u2019s proposed changes. By its letter of the same date to the Tribunal, the Respondent enclosed a document containing corrections related to the testimony of those witnesses and experts who testified in Spanish and informed the Tribunal that the Claimant had agreed to the Respondent\u2019s corrections.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated 3 November 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties that due to an internal reorganization of tasks at the Centre, Mr. Tomas Solis had been replaced by Ms. Natali Sequeira as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 26 November 2008, Mrs Eloise M. Obadia, Senior Counsel at ICSID (in the absence of Ms Natali Sequeira) informed the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal had, as of 26 November 2008, declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**2. THE CLAIMS AND RELIEF SOUGHT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant formulated in its Opening Memorial of 9 October 2007 (hereinafter referred to as \"CI\") its Claims and the Relief sought as follows :\n\n*Peru induced AEL to make a significant investment into its infrastructure on the basis of a guarantee that AEL\u2019s investment would be treated at least as well as any other investor operating in the same economic sector. Despite this guarantee, Peru proceeded not only to offer a significantly more advantageous investment model to favored investors, but also to treat such investments in an arbitrarily better fashion than it treated AEL.*\n\n*These acts of discrimination have been compounded by the inability of the Peruvian courts to grant effective remedies for the same, despite clearly finding that discrimination has occurred (discrimination being a violation of Peruvian domestic law irrespective of the Conite Agreement). Even where one organ of Peru has been forced to accept that it has acted improperly, another has then stepped in to continue the violation. Such a campaign of discrimination is all the more offensive as this claim is not based on a generalized open ended promise found in an investment treaty, but is instead founded on an direct bilateral contractual promise voluntarily and specifically extended by Peru to AEL in contemplation of this very investment.*\n\n*AEL has accordingly been deprived of the benefit of its bargain with the Peruvian state, a bargain which was the keystone of AEL\u2019s investment of over US$300,000,000. It is entitled, as matter of both Peruvian law and under international law to be made whole for these breaches.*\n\n*AEL therefore seeks, and is entitled to, the following relief.*\n\n*(a) a declaration that Peru has breached the Conite Agreement by creating investment regimes providing favorable treatment to comparable investors and not affording such comparable treatment to AEL\u2019s investment;*\n\n*(b) a declaration that Peru has breached the Conite Agreement by:*\n\n*(i) discriminating against AEL\u2019s investment by refusing to define L-252 as part of the STP, whilst defining a competitor\u2019s transmission line, with the same characteristics, as part of the STP, and*\n\n*(ii) failing in such circumstances to effectively remedy such a breach of AEL\u2019s right to non-discrimination;*\n\n*(c) a declaration that Peru has breached the Conite Agreement by:*\n\n*(i) discriminating against AEL\u2019s investment by failing to recognize L-251 as an Exceptional Case, and failing to grant the full financial benefits such a recognition affords whilst granting such benefits to other similarly classified lines, and*\n\n*(ii) failing in such circumstances to effectively remedy such a breach of AEL\u2019s right to non-discrimination;*\n\n*(d) a declaration that Peru has breached the Conite Agreement by:*\n\n*(i) discriminating against AEL\u2019s investment by discounting the VNR,**Average Cost, and O&M costs data supplied by Eteselva, whilst allowing other entities to recover 100% of their actual cost, and*\n\n*(ii) failing in such circumstances to effectively remedy such a breach of AEL\u2019s right to non-discrimination;*\n\n*(e) an order that the Respondent pays to the Claimant the sum of US$ 140,600,0007, which is inclusive of interest and discounted in accordance with applicable Peruvian regulations, in compensation for the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Conite Agreement;*\n\n*(f) the award of:*\n\n*(i) its share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of ICSID\u2019s facilities; and*\n\n*(ii) its legal and related fees in connection with these proceedings.*\n\nIn its Reply Memorial this amount was reduced to US$ 132,310,000 (\u00a7 151). At the Hearing this amount was further reduced to US$ 91.1 million (see Transcript, p. 475, 476, 477 and C-73).\n\n32.\n\nIn its Reply Memorial of 22 April 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \"CII\"), the Claimant sought the following relief:\n\n*In short, AEL avers that the Tribunal should reach the following findings as to the remaining contentious issues between the parties:*\n\n*(a) The Conite Agreement recognizes and provides a substantive right to AEL that its investment (which consists of the Termoselva, Eteselva and their assets) would not be discriminated against;*\n\n*(b) Peru has in fact discriminated against AEL\u2019s investment by affording superior treatment (which AEL was never given the opportunity to enjoy) to investors engaged in the same economic activity as AEL;*\n\n*(c) Peru has no lawful excuse for such discrimination; and*\n\n*(d) As a result of such discrimination AEL has suffered loss, which it may recover in full measure.*\n\n*In the circumstances of Peru not denying its conduct, but instead seeking to defend such conduct through contorted, illogical readings of an agreement designed to encourage foreign investment, any alterative finding would signal a complete failure of the Conite Agreement to provide the protections which were promised to AEL.*\n\n33.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial of 29 February 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \"RI\"), the Respondent concluded that :\n\n*This case ultimately centers on contracts that Claimant sought from Peru and agreed with Peru, pursuant to specific provisions of Peruvian law. Claimant now wants this Tribunal to disregard those contracts.*\n\n*Claimant\u2019s Stability Agreement acts, by law, only to \"freeze\" certain laws for a period of ten years. Claimant insists on interpretations of this contract that are so strained as to present concerns of bad faith.*\n\n*Claimant\u2019s Electricity Transmission Concession Agreement provides, by law, that Claimant\u2019s transmission lines are subject to the Electricity Concessions Law and its Regulations. Claimant instead urges this Tribunal to disregard its own Transmission Concession and instead grant Claimant the supposed benefits of the ISA BOOT Concession - a completely distinct contract granted by public bidding to another foreign investor under different economic terms and laws. Claimant wants the Tribunal to ignore the Transmission Concession altogether because Claimant failed even to submit it or cite it to the Tribunal. There can be no sufficient excuse invented for such an omission.*\n\nand requested that \"*the Tribunal dismiss Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety.\".*\n\n34.\n\nIn its Rejoinder of 16 June 2008 (hereinafter referred to as \"RII\"), the Respondent concluded that :\n\n*The Stability Agreement is a \"freezing agreement\" that provides, in pertinent part, for the \"stability of the right to non-discrimination\" as specified therein for a specified term of ten years. Nothing in the Stability Agreement, Peruvian law or any other conceivably applicable source of law leads to the conclusion that claimant is entitled to cherry-pick from the BOOT contract of a third party - at prejudice to other holders of 185 electricity transmission concession, as well as Peruvian consumers. Claimant has utterly failed to satisfy its burden of proof.*\n\n**3. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n**3.1.** The Claimant\n---------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant is a limited liability company created and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (U.S.A.) It is the parent of the Peruvian company Aguaytia Energy del Peru S.R.L. (\"Aguaytia Energy\"). In turn, Aguaytia Energy is the parent of two further Peruvian legal entities, Eteselva S.R.L. (\"Eteselva\") and Termoselva S.R.L. (\"Termoselva\"). These companies were set up in connection with the Aguaytia Project.\n\n36.\n\nThe Aguaytia gas fields are located in a remote region of Peru, east of the Andes Mountains. The fields were discovered by Mobil Oil Corporation in 1961 but had not been commercialized due to a lack of market for natural gas. At the beginning of the 1990s Peru enacted new laws for the hydrocarbon sector and the electric power circuit together with the privatization of both these sectors.\n\n37.\n\nThe Executive Summary of the Information Memorandum prepared by The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. dated 9 September 1994 described the Aguaytia Project as follows8:\n\n*The Maple Gas Corporation (\"Maple\") was formed in 1986 to invest in oil and gas related entities and assets. During the following six years, Maple operated oil and gas producing properties, gas gathering and transmission facilities, and gas processing and treating facilities. In addition, Maple drilled and completed wells, constructed gas pipelines and plant facilities, and marketed crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\").*\n\n*In March, 1993, Maple was awarded the Aguaytia Project (the \"Project\") by the Government of Peru pursuant to the terms of an international tender. One year later after negotiating the contractual terms of the Project and receiving the necessary governmental approvals, Maple\u2019s Peruvian Branch signed a 30-year license contract with the Government for the development of the Aguaytia gas field. Though the field was discovered by Mobil Oil Corporation in 1961, it had not been commercialized due to a lack of market for the natural gas. The field has an estimated 302 billion cubic feet of recoverable gas reserves and 21.9 million barrels of recoverable NGL reserves.*\n\n*With the enactment of new laws in Peru for the hydrocarbon sector and the electric power sector as well as the current privatization of both these sectors, free markets for hydrocarbons and electricity are being established that make it possible to commercialize the gas field at this time. In addition, under the leadership of President Alberto Fujimori, a number of structural reforms have been successfully implemented in Peru which have revitalized the Peruvian economy and pacified the country. The free market environment coupled with a resurgent economy make Peru an attractive investment opportunity.*\n\n*The Project consists of both a Gas Project and a Power Project. The Gas Project includes the drilling of additional gas wells in the field, the construction and operation of gas processing facilities, the construction and operation of two gas pipelines and one NGL pipeline, and the construction and operation of NGL fractionation and storage facilities at a total capital cost of U.S. $50.8 million. Gas from the field will be supplied to two new power plants Maple will construct. NGLs will be fractionated, and the resulting propane, butane, and natural gasoline will be sold to an existing domestic market.*\n\n*The Power Project includes the construction and operation of two gas-fired thermoelectric power plants, as well as related electric substations and transmission facilities. One plant with 110 megawatts (\"MW\") of capacity (at peak conditions) will supply energy to the main power grid in Peru. This grid is highly dependent on hydroelectric energy and requires additional thermal capacity to increase its reliability and to satisfy increasing electrical demand. With a revitalized economy, demand for energy is growing rapidly. In 1993, for example, electric demand grew by seven percent. Since the cost for gas is low relative to that of liquid hydrocarbons such as diesel or residual fuel oil, and since Maple\u2019s plant is the only gas-**fired thermoelectric plant connected to the main power grid under active development, it should be the lowest cost thermoelectric producer of energy on the grid. As a result, the Maple plant will be a very competitive source of electric energy and it is expected to be the first thermoelectric power plant dispatched on the main power grid. A second power plant with a capacity of 30 MW (at peak load) will be built by Maple in the city of Pucallpa, the largest city in the central jungle of Peru. This plant will become the base load supply for the electric distribution system in the Pucallpa area and will essentially displace the existing diesel fired generation facilities which are inefficient and expensive to operate. The total capital cost for both power plants and related substation and transmission facilities is U.S.S 66.3 million.*\n\n*A summary of the economics of the Gas and Power Projects are shown below:*\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Project | Capital Expenditures (U.S. $million) | After-Tax Internal Rate of Return |\n| Gas | 50.8 | 32.9% |\n| Power | 66.3 | 24.8% |\n| Total | 117.1 | 28.3% |\n\nC-37, Original Chase Information Memorandum, 9 September 1994.\n\n38.\n\nThe Application for Registration of Legal Stability Contracts of 1996 contained the following information on the Project9\n\n*The investment will be made in developing the Aguaytia Comprehensive Project (the \"Project\"), whose development will be assumed by The Maple Gas Corporation del Peru, Sucursal Peruana (\"Maple\"), based on the signing with Perupetro S.A. of the License Agreement for Site 31-C Hydrocarbons Production dated March 30, 1994 (the \"License**Agreement\"). Maple will assign to Aguaytia Energy del Pero S.R. Ltda. ninety-nine percent (99%) of its rights in the License Agreement, subject to authorization and approval by the competent authority, in order to participate jointly with the latter as contractor under the License Agreement (the \"Contractor\").*\n\n*Among other things, the License Agreement grants the Contractor the right to produce natural gas from the Aguaytia reservoir located approximately one hundred kilometers (100 kms.) west of the city of Pucallpa in the department of Ucayali for an initial period of thirty (30) years, which may be extended forty (40) years.*\n\n*The Project has a hydrocarbon production component (the \"Gas Component\") and one for generation and transmission of thermoelectrical power (the \"Power Component\").*\n\n*The Gas Component includes, among others, the production integrity and capacity test of existing wells and drilling of additional wells for production of natural gas in the contract area of the License Agreement; construction and operation, either directly or indirectly, of: a) a natural gas processing plant; (b) a natural gas liquids fractioning plant; (c) a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply plant; (d) gas pipelines for transportation of residue gas and fuel pipelines for transportation of natural gas liquids, natural gasolines, and liquefied petroleum gas; and (e) facilities for LPG storage, loading, and unloading.*\n\n*The* *Power Component includes, among others, the construction and operation, either directly or indirectly, of: (a) a thermoelectric power plant with minimum installed capacity of one hundred forty megawatts (140 MW), near the city of Aguaytia (the \"Aguaytia Thermoelectric Plant\"); (b) a two hundred twenty kilovolts transmission line (220 kV) approximately three hundred ninety-eight kilometers (398 kms.) long; and (c) power transmission and transformation facilities for transportation of power generated at the Aguaytia Thermoelectric Plant from the latter to the town of Paramonga on the country\u2019s northern coast.*\n\nC-6, AEL Application for Registration of Legal Stability Contracts, 1996; see also \u00a7 42 *infra.*\n\n39.\n\nAfter having obtained the Legal Stability Agreement10 and the necessary concession for the power transmission activities11, it solicited a number of other entities and obtained their involvement as initial shareholders in the Claimant12.\n\n\u00a7 43 *infra*\n\n\u00a7 51 *infra*\n\nC-1, Opening Memorial, \u00a7 29\n\n**3.2** The Respondent\n----------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Peru.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to the Claimant and not disputed by the Respondent the Republic of Peru is\n\n*responsible for its own conduct through the agency of the Ministry for Energy and Mines (\"MEM\") and for that of :*\n\n*(a) the* ***Comision*** *Nacional de Inversiones y Tecnologias Extranjeras* ***(\"Conite\")*** *to whom the co-ordination of foreign investment promotion was delegated by means of Legislative Decree 662, Articles 23 and 30.13*\n\n*(b) the Comisi\u00f3n de Tarifas de Energia* ***(\"CTE\"),*** *which prior to May 17, 1999 was known as the Comisi\u00f4n de Tarifas El\u00e9ctricas, and which was absorbed into the Organismo Supervisor de la Inversion en Energia14* ***(\"Osinerg\")*** *on May 10, 2001.15 Prior to its absorption one of CTE\u2019s functions was to set the tariffs and compensations for the use of electricity transmission systems.*\n\n*(c) Osinerg, to which, since May 10, 2001, the regulation and supervision of investments made in Peru\u2019s electricity market (including the compensations and tariffs related to the same) is delegated by means of Laws 2673410 and 27332,11 and by Supreme Decrees 032-2001-PCM, 054-2001-PCM and 055-2001-PCM. 12 In the recitals to Supreme Decree 032-2001-PCM, it is specifically noted that one of Osinerg\u2019s functions is to act as a guarantee to companies that operate and invest in the electricity sector \"that the regulatory activity of such agencies will be based exclusively on legal, technical and economic criteria\". This is further explained in Articles 6 and 9 of Supreme Decree 054-2001-PCM:*\n\n*Decisions and actions by OSINERG shall be aimed at guaranteeing that there is no discrimination among the ENTITIES to the effect that some are given an unjustified competitive advantage over others.*  \n*OSINERG shall apply all laws and regulations in effect. Cases or situations having similar characteristics shall be treated similarly.*\n\n*As a matter of domestic law, the conduct of CTE, Conite and Osinerg is attributed to Peru. For domestic law purposes there is only one Republic of Peru or \u2018government\u2019.16 Therefore, each administrative agency cannot be considered independently, but rather must be considered as part of the**Peruvian government when performing a function delegated to it by the government. Accordingly, acts of an agency such as CTE, Conite or Osinerg, when performing a governmental function delegated to it under Peruvian law, are those of Peru.17*\n\nFollowing the date of the Conite Agreement, the functions and role of CONITE were assumed by a successor entity, *Agenda de Promod\u00f4n de la Inversion Privada - Proinversi**\u00f3**n.* Legislative Decree 662 is exhibited as CLA-1.\n\nRenamed, since January 25, 2007, as *Organismo Supervisor de la Inversion en Energia y Mineria &* sometimes referred to as \"OSINERGMIN\".\n\nBy way of Supreme Decree 054-2001-PCM, Third Transitional Provision, (Exhibit CLA-2) authorized under Law 27332 Third Final Provision (2000) (Exhibit CLA-3).\n\nArticle 43 of the Political Constitution of Peru, exhibited as CLA-7. *See also* Avenda\u00f1o at \u00b6\u00b6[129-147],\n\nCI, pp. 7 and 8.\n\n**3.3** Developments between **1996** and **2005**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nAfter having received the license for the gas exploration for the Aguaytia field, Maple with the assistance of Chase Manhattan Bank approached a number of prospective investors18 which on 10 January 1996 gave rise to the formation of Aguaytia Energy LLC.19\n\nC-37\n\nC-5\n\n43.\n\nMaple also submitted to the Peruvian authorities an application for registration of legal stability contracts20.

In order to transport the electric power that this Plant generates, it requires to start the operation of the Concession\u2019s Facilities immediately, even if it\u2019s temporarily under an emergency condition like the one that caused the Concession\u2019s Facilities to**be commercially used to attend to the emergency put forward by Electrocentro S.A.27*\n\nRl, p. 13\n\n**3.4** The classification of the transmission lines\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe transmission lines erected by the Claimant are the following28 :\n\n*(a) transmission line* ***L-251*** *(from the Aguaytia sub-station to the Tingo Maria sub-station);*\n\n*(b) transmission line* ***L-252*** *(from the Tingo Maria sub-station to the Vizcarra sub-station);*\n\n*(c) transmission line* ***L-253*** *(from the Vizcarra sub-station to the Paramonga Nueva sub-station); and*\n\n*(d) certain transmission and transformation facilities located at the Tingo Maria sub-station (the* ***\"Tingo Marla Facilities\").***\n\nCl, \u00a7 35\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, transmission lines in Peru were classified as follows :\n\n*As noted, the activities of generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of electricity are in Peru governed by the provisions of the LCE (the Electrical Concessions Law). Under the LCE, the transmission of electricity is subject to price regulation. As a consequence the amount of compensation earned for the use of the Transmission Facilities (and the responsibility for the payment of the same) depends on the provisions of the LCE and the RLCE. Under these provisions, the regulator (i.e. Osinerg and previously CTE), must apply Article 58 of the LCE and Article 132 of the RLCE to make a recommendation to MEM regarding the proper classification of transmission systems.*\n\n*Article 58 of the LCE, until July 24, 2006, required MEM to classify lines L-251 and L-252 in one of two ways29, either as:*\n\n*(a) part of the STP (the primary transmission system), in which case the compensation for their use is paid exclusively by all the consumers of electricity in Peru, or*\n\n*(b) part of the SSTT (the secondary transmission system), in which case, at all relevant times, the compensation for their use has to be paid by one of the following, as determined by Osinerg:*\n\n*(i) by the generators connected to the SEIN (to be applied if L-251 and L-252 are used by the generators to connect to a busbar of SEIN\u2019s30 SPT);*\n\n*(ii) by the Demand connected to the SEIN (to be applied if L-251 and L-252 are used by the Demand to connect to a busbar of SEIN\u2019s SPT); or*\n\n*(iii) by the generators, the Demand and/or a combination of the same, on the basis of regulator\u2019s assessment of the use and/or economic benefit that the transmission lines in question provides to each group, if L-251 and L-252 are Exceptional Cases, being cases not falling into either of the above two categories.*\n\n*For these purposes, Termoselva is a generator. Accordingly, MEM\u2019s classification of L-251 and L-252 will determine what percentage of Eteselva\u2019s transmission fee Termoselva will be required to pay, and what percentage will be payable by third parties - i.e. what income AEL\u2019s investment will receive.31*\n\nThe same is true of both L-253 and the Tingo Maria Facilities, but these were classified as part of the STP by way of Ministerial Resolution No. 413-2000-EM/VME in November 2000 and do not accordingly form part of the Classification Dispute\n\nSEIN = *Sistema El\u00e9ctrico Interconectado Nacional,* or National Electrical Interconnected System\n\nCl, \u00a7\u00a7 75-77\n\n**3.5** The **BOOT** Concession\n-------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nTowards the end of the 1990\u2019s the Peruvian authorities came to the conclusion that the main grid needed to be reinforced.\n\n*On 1 December 1999, COPRI32, the agency responsible at the time for conducting bids for bid-based public works concessions for infrastructure projects, decided to conduct an international public bid for a BOOT concession pursuant to the bid-based concessions regime explained above.*\n\n*On 31 December 1999, a Supreme Resolution ratified COPRI\u2019s decision**and appointed the special \"CELE\"33 committee charged with conducting the international bid.*\n\n*The subsequent bidding history is detailed in the witness declaration of Mr. Anthony Laub Benavides, a member of the CELE. As Mr. Laub describes, the CELE prepared an executive summary, dated April 2000, which described the purpose of the proposed concession and noted the need for this infrastructure project in Peru:*\n\n*This planned 220 kV line, which will be linked at strategic points to the 220 kV line that runs parallel to the coast, will enhance the reliability of the system due to its ring design.*\n\n*Moreover, it will permit a better use of the hydroelectric units of the mountains region, and will provide energy to mining projects nearby such as the Antamina project.*\n\n*The CELE\u2019s financial advisor (Interinvest), along with COPRI, circulated this executive summary among potential investors. On 26 May 2000, Interinvest submitted to the CELE a \"Final Pre-Promotion Report\" detailing the progress of these invitations. In it, Interinvest noted that 15 companies had been contacted as potential operators, including both ISA and Duke Energy (which currently holds a \"controlling interest\" over Aguaytia).34*\n\nCOPRI = *Comisi\u00f4n para la Promoci**\u00f3**n de la Inversion Privada,* the Commission for the Promotion of Private Investment, charged with promoting foreign investment into Peru.\n\nCELE = *Comit\u00e9 Especial Lineas El\u00e9ctricas,* Special Committee for Electricity Lines established by CONITE.\n\nRl, \u00a7\u00a7 134-136.\n\n58.\n\nIn July 2000, CELE prepared (and COPRI approved) a \"plan for the promotion of private investment\" setting forth the main terms for the BOOT concession.35\n\nR-26.\n\n59.\n\nThis investment model was based on a Build, Operate, Own and, ultimately, Transfer (\"BOOT\") basis. Among various other incentives to potential bidders, the offer envisaged \"a stable remuneration scheme, independent of the actual load flow, due to its classification as part of the Main (i.e. Principal) Transmission System\"36.\n\nRl, \u00a7 143 and Executive Summary dated April 2000 (R-24).\n\n60.\n\nThe Republic of Peru called for an International Tender (\"Concurso Publico Intemacional\") for the BOOT Concession. Among the various qualified bidders the concession went to ISA (from Columbia). The ISA BOOT Concession was signed by ISA and MEM representatives on 26 April 200137. Neither the Claimant nor its principal shareholders submitted bids to obtain this concession.38\n\nR-4.\n\nRI, \u00a7 137.\n\n**3.6.** Claimant\u2019s classification and discrimination disputes in Peru\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nShortly after the completion of the Transmission Facilities, the Claimant requested the competent Peruvian authorities to review the classification of the Transmission Lines. In part, these endeavors were successful, but the classification of L-251 and L-252 was never decided in a manner fully satisfactory to the Claimant notwithstanding a susbstantial number of decisions by the regulatory instances and by the Peruvian civil and administrative courts based on various different procedures open to the Claimant under Peruvian legislation. In the context of this Award it is not, however, necessary to deal with the details of these various, partly unsuccessful, attempts by the Claimant to obtain the result it requested. The claims were partially based on technical criteria (direction of the flow of the electricity, etc.) or then based on alleged discrimination. The discrimination claims were based on constitutional grounds. In this context the Constitutional Tribunal of Peru in its decision of 30 January 2004 stated the following:\n\n*In this respect, it should be pointed out that* ***equality before the law*** *is a constitutional right that has two fundamental components. As explained by Peruvian author Francisco Eguiguren Praeli, one of them is* ***equality of the law or in the law,*** *which consists of the preventing legislators from passing laws that contravene the principle of equality of treatment, to which**everyone has a right. The other is* ***equality in the application of the law,*** *which imposes the obligation of all public agencies \"to refrain from applying the law in a different manner to persons in similar cases or situations\"* ***(EGUIGUREN PRAELI, Francisco. Constitutional Studies.******ARA Editor es. 1st Edition, May 2002, page 97)****39* (emphasis added)\n\nCLA-21, \u00a7 10.\n\n62.\n\nIn view of the lack of full success with the internal administrative and court procedures, the Claimant commenced on 10 May 2006 the present ICSID proceedings.\n\n**4. THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n**4.1. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n4.1.1. Position of the Claimant\n-------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn order to justify its claims the Claimant advanced the following arguments40\n\n*AEL's Contract*\n\n*1. AEL and Peru entered into the Conite Agreement on 17 May 1996. The Conite Agreement was entered as a part of Peru's general inducement to foreign investors to invest capital into Peru.*\n\n*2. The Conite Agreement contained:*\n\n*(a) A promise by Peru to \"guarantee legal stability for (AEL) in the following terms:... Stability of the right to non-discrimination, as provided in Sub-paragraph c) of Article 10 of (LD 662)\"*\n\n*(i) While this is a stabilization of an existing right rather than a new right to non-discrimination itself, legal stability cannot be said to exist if Peru itself takes uncorrected action contrary to AEL's right to stability (i.e. an act of discrimination by Peru is prima facie evidence of a breach of the right to stability).*\n\n*(ii) The reference to Art. 10 of LD 662 is enabling rather than defining in nature (i.e. it speaks to Peru's capacity to give the promise rather than the**scope of that promise). Art. 10 refers to Art. 2 which does offer a definition of the scope of the right - \"Foreign investors (i.e. AEL) and the companies in which these participate (i.e. AEL Energy, Termoselva and Eteselva) shall have the same rights and obligations as the local investors and companies (the full suite of anti-discrimination protections offered under LD 757 and the Constitution). Such rights and obligations are only limited by the exceptions established (in the Constitution).\"*\n\n*(iii) It is noteworthy that the protection is expressed to cover both AEL and its investments (although the investment vehicles will not, of course, have an independent right to sue on this agreement).*\n\n*(b) A representation (the Representation) as to the scope of the right to nondiscrimination: \"which implies that (Peru), at none of its levels.., may impose on (AEL) a differentiated treatment based on its nationality, the sectors or types of economic activity it develops...and no other cause with equivalent effect.\"*\n\n*3. The rights generally enjoyed by local investors, and thus guaranteed to AEL in a stabilized form (irrespective of the additional level of protection granted through the Representation), arise out of:*\n\n*(a) Art. 2 of the Constitution (general right to equality before the law);*\n\n*(b) Art. 60 of the Constitution / Art. 7 of LD 757 '(businesses to receive same treatment irrespective of public/private ownership);*\n\n*(c) Ar. 63 of the Constitution / Art. 12 of LD 757 (no discrimination on the basis of nationality);*\n\n*(d) Art. 12 of LD 757 (no discrimination or differentiation in respect of tariffs on the grounds of type of economic activity); and*\n\n*(e) SD 162-1992- EF (general restatement of the above principles).*\n\n*4. The Conite Agreement grants a more comprehensive promise to AEL than this broad web of protections however.*\n\n*(a) The Representation represents a clear, absolute and unqualified promise that AEL will not be discriminated against, including on the basis of economic activity.*\n\n*(b) This is a self-contained promise as to the scope of the protection that the Conite Agreement affords, and is not limited by the excuses found in the general Peruvian anti-discrimination regime (e.g. the ability to differentiate or justify under the 'six step test).*\n\n*(c) In the event that the stabilized protection afforded under Peruvian law does not reach this standard, then Peru will have separately breached its contractual obligations if it does not honour the Representation in any event.*\n\n*5. The interpretation of the Conite Agreement, and the standards by which Peru's performance of the obligations contained therein are to be judged, is governed by Peruvian law, subject to the prescriptive effect of international law.*\n\n*(a) The Conite Agreement contains no express nomination of governing law, but does select ICSID arbitration, thereby importing Art. 42 of the Washington Convention, which specifies that international law shall have a prescriptive function in circumstances such as these.*\n\n*(b) Peru's argument that the requirements of the first limb of Art. 42 are satisfied by an implied choice of law in the Conite Agreement or through the application of conflicts of law principles is bad - if such an argument were correct, there are no circumstances where the second limb of Art. 42 would ever be triggered.*\n\n*(c) In any event, as a consequence of Peru reaching beyond its borders to attract investment, its conduct attracts international law supervision as a base line standard for its treatment of AEL.*\n\n*(d) In the premises, Peruvian law and international law are materially the same on the relevant issues, both recognizing:*\n\n*(i) that Peru is under a duty to negotiate, execute and implement contracts in good faith;*\n\n*(ii) the principle of pacta sunt servanda;*\n\n*(iii) that discrimination should not take place between investors; and*\n\n*(iv) principles of contractual interpretation which require the use of textual, purposive and systematic approaches, applying an assumption that the parties negotiated in good faith.*\n\n*II Peru's Breach of the Conite Agreement*\n\n*6. Peru has breached the Conite Agreement by taking actions inconsistent with the stability of AEL's right to non-discrimination:*\n\n*(a) Osinerg/CELE-COPRVMEM applying more favourable treatment to Etecen (a state entity) and ISA (an investor in the same sector) than Eteselva in the classification of transmission lines as PTS or STS. This violation has been exacerbated by the recognition of such discrimination by the Constitutional Court, and the subsequent failure of Peru to remedy the position.*\n\n*(b) Osinerg/MEM applying more favourable treatment to other private and state-held generation companies than Termoselva in allocating the responsibility for paying the tariff for the use of STS lines;*\n\n*(c) Osinerg/CELE-COPRVMEM affording more favourable treatment to BOOT investors than to Eteselva in setting the tariff governing the amounts payable for the use of transmission lines by third parties; and*\n\n*(d) Allowing other foreign investors to take advantage of a more favourable investment mechanism (i.e. the BOOT) than was available to AEL, but denying access to such mechanism to AEL.*\n\n*7. To be clear: AEL agrees that Peru is entitled to offer BOOTs and provide the treatment it has to Etecen, Etesur, ISA, REP etc. Peru's breach of the Conite Agreement is its failure to afford the same (or equivalent) treatment to AEL.*\n\nExcerpt from the \"Case on behalf of Claimant\" submitted in writing after the oral presentation at the Opening Statement of the Hearing of 14 July 2008, pp. 1-3.\n\n4.1.2. Position of the Respondent\n---------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent states that according to the plain language of the Agreement, the Claimant was guaranteed the stability of the right to non-discrimination but no substantive right to non-discrimination.\n\n65.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant has not proven that it was discriminated against by the Respondent and, lastly, the Claimant has failed to satisfy the requirement for the alleged damages, the analysis of which is fraught with error.\n\n**5. DISCUSSION**\n-----------------\n\n**5.1.** Jurisdiction\n---------------------\n\n66.\n\nArticle 9 of the Agreement provides that\n\n*\"any litigation, controversy or claim among the parties, in connection with the construction, performance, enforcement or validity (of this Agreement), shall be submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment-Related Discrepancies, to be solved through international de jure arbitration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Rules set forth in the Covenant for the Settlement of Investment-Related Discrepancies amongst States and Nationals from Other States.\"*\n\n67.\n\nThe requirements of Article 25 of the Convention are fulfilled in the present case. The dispute is a legal dispute and arises directly out of an investment by AEL, a national of a Contracting State (U.S.A.) in the Republic of Peru, another Contracting State. In the Agreement, both Parties to the dispute have consented in writing to submit such a dispute to the Centre. The Tribunal furthermore notes that no Party has questioned the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and the Parties have confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted41.\n\nMinutes of the May 18, 2007 Session, Chapter I, \u00a7 1.\n\n68.\n\nOn 18 July 2008, at the close of the Hearing in Washington D.C., the Parties and the Arbitrators confirmed that they had no further issues they wished to raise and both Parties confirmed that they were in agreement with the procedure as it had been conducted up to that moment.42\n\nTranscript, p. 1110,18-22; p. 1111,1-13.\n\n69.\n\nThe Concession Agreement of 16 July 1996 in Article 14 provides:\n\n***Judicial Jurisdiction***\n\n*The agreement hereto is exclusively subject to the jurisdiction of the judges and courts of the capital of Peru. The concessionaire hereby waives any intention to submit the disputes that may arise to foreign courts as well as to file any claim through diplomatic channels.*\n\n70.\n\nIt therefore follows that this Tribunal is only competent to decide disputes between the Parties which arise *\"in connection with the construction, performance, enforcement or**validity\"* of the Agreement. However, all disputes or controversies which might arise in connection with *\"the conditions, rights and duties that regulate the electrical**transmission final concession\"* (Concession Agreement, Second Article, Aim) fall fully and entirely within the jurisdiction of the Peruvian judges and courts.\n\n**5.2.** Applicable Law\n-----------------------\n\n71.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the Convention provides:\n\n*The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"*\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore notes that basically the laws of the Republic of Peru shall apply together with such rules of international law as may be applicable. The Parties have developed this point to some extent and have also submitted expert reports, especially on the question of what rules of international law might be applicable. However, both Parties agree that the Agreement is a contract governed by the Peruvian Civil Code (PCC). At the end of the procedure, both Parties seem to have come to the same conclusion because, as Mr. Loftis for the Claimant stated:\n\n*We submit that Peruvian Law, properly understood and applied, and international law lead to the same conclusion, so the issue is really of limited currency.43*\n\nTranscript, p. 943,17 to 19.\n\n73.\n\nAnd Ms. Cohen Smutny for the Respondent stated\n\n*The question is does it matter, and maybe for different reasons both Parties are of the view that it does not ultimately matter because Peruvian law**applies here, and it is consistent in all material respects with international law.44*\n\nTranscript 1040, 9 to 14.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal has also reached the conclusion that for the resolution of this dispute it need not look beyond Peruvian law.\n\n**5.3. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n75.\n\nThe basic question for the Arbitral Tribunal is: (i) whether the Agreement is to be interpreted as providing a substantive guarantee of non-discrimination against the investor under Article III(5); or (ii) whether the various Article III guarantees are to be interpreted in the sense that the State may not, for the duration of the Agreement (ten years), change the laws, rules, regulations, etc. which are in force at the time the Agreement was concluded, but do not grant any substantive rights against future discriminatory action as such to the investor.\n\n76.\n\nIf we conclude that the Agreement, properly construed, guarantees that the legal framework in the five fields enumerated in Article III will not be modified during its term, rather than creating a free standing, substantive protection against discrimination, that is the end of the matter. This is because the Claimant asserts no case based on detrimental legislative or other legal framework change, and it is common ground that the Peruvian courts, and not this Tribunal, have jurisdiction over any alleged breach by the state of its anti-discrimination laws.\n\n77.\n\nThe Agreement constitutes a contract between the Republic of Peru and the Claimant subject to the PCC and therefore, has to be interpreted based on the rules established to interpret contracts governed by Peruvian civil law.\n\n78.\n\nIn his first statement, Professor Jorge Avendano, expert witness for the Claimant, opined as follows regarding the interpretation of agreements under Peruvian Law :\n\n*50. The Civil Code contains specific provisions regarding the way in which contracts must be interpreted, negotiated, entered into and executed.*\n\n*51. The first rule is mentioned in Article 168, according to which \"The legal act must be interpreted in accordance with what is stated therein, and according to the principle of good faith\".*\n\n*52. Article 169 of the Civil Code contains the systematic method of contract interpretation, according to which \"The clauses of legal documents are interpreted through each other, attributing to the doubtful ones the sense resulting from the clauses considered as a whole\". Indeed, \"In legal businesses the provisions of the parties should not be interpreted in isolation, but should be correlated with the general context and economic purpose they pursue\". \"This is because businesses are usually a harmonic whole or group, in such a way that the provisions that make them up should be interpreted on a complementary basis, without the absolute individualization thereof seeming correct, since the business as a whole seeks global purposes, without prejudice to the particular provisions which said ends or purposes contribute to.\"*\n\n*53. The finalist method of contractual interpretation is contained in Article 170 of the Civil Code, which provides that \"Expressions having several senses should be understood in the one that is most adequate to the nature and object of the document\". The purpose of this method of interpretation is to find the sense of the contractual agreement, taking into account the nature of the business entered into between the parties. This criterion makes it mandatory to consider the economic-social function of the business, as well as the practical end it pursues.*\n\n*54. On the other hand, according to Article 1361 of the Civil Code \"Contracts are mandatory as to whatever is stated therein. It is presumed that the express declaration made in the contract responds to the common will of the parties and whoever denies this coincidence must prove it\". In other words, the interpretation refers to the declaration made in the legal business and not to the subjective will of the contracting parties.*\n\n*55. Finally, Article 1362 of the Civil Code provides that \"Contracts must be negotiated, entered into and performed in accordance with the rules of good faith and the common intention of the parties\". In this way, good faith is not only a contractual interpretation criterion but also has the function of being an integrating principle of the content of the legal acts.*\n\n79.\n\nProfessor Alfredo Bullard Gonzalez, in his first opinion45 as expert for the Respondent, cites the same articles from the PCC while stressing that the starting point of the Peruvian system is the interpretation based on the expression of the parties\u2019 will set forth in the contract and not on the will itself, referring to Articles 168 and 1361 PCC:\n\n*Literal interpretation must be contrasted with the other interpretive criteria, but without contradicting what the parties expressly indicated.46*\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 35 through 54.\n\n\u00a7 40.\n\n80.\n\nA further principle is that of the unity of the contract (systematic interpretation) contained in Article 169 PCC.\n\n81.\n\nAccording to Professor Bullard, the search for the true will is derived from the principle of good faith set forth in Article 168 PCC.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, Professor Bullard invokes the functional interpretation according to which\n\n*... one must search for or prefer, among various possible interpretations, the interpretation that is consistent with the purpose or intent of the clause that is subject to interpretation.47*\n\n\u00a7 51.\n\n83.\n\nIn this context he bases his opinion on Article 170 PCC.\n\n84.\n\nBoth Parties seem to agree that the starting point of any interpretation must be the wording of the text agreed upon between the parties. The Tribunal therefore starts its analysis with the text of the Agreement and the legal documents referred to therein, and then examines whether the result requires modification after taking into account further rules of interpretation under Peruvian civil law, especially the issue of whether this result is consistent with the requirement of good faith and the common intention of the Parties as provided for in Article 1362 PCC.\n\n85.\n\nThe Agreement in Article III states that:\n\n*... the STATE undertakes to* *guarantee juridical stability* *for AGUAYTIA in connection with the investment referred to in ARTICLE TWO under the terms set forth below:* (emphasis added)\n\n86.\n\nSection 5 of Article III provides:\n\n*5. Stability of the right to non-discrimination, as provided for in item c), article 10, of Legislative Decree 662, which implies that the STATE or neither one of its bodies, notwithstanding these may include entities or companies from the Central Government, Regional or Local Governments, may apply a differentiated treatment to AGUAYTIA by reason of its nationality, the sectors or types of economic activity it shall develop, or the geographical location of the firm in which it invests, and neither as far as the matters herein below specified:*\n\n*The term of effectiveness of this juridical Stability Agreement is ten (10) years counted as from the date of its execution. Accordingly, throughout this term,* *it may not be amended* *by ether of the parties individually,* *regardless of whether the national legislation could be eventually amended* *and notwithstanding the fact that such amendments to the national legislation may turn out to be more beneficial or harmful to any of the Parties, than those agreed hereunder,* (emphasis added)\n\n87.\n\nThe Agreement refers to the Legislative Decree 66248, Article 10 (c). Legislative Decree 662 of 2 September 1991 identified the purpose of the legislation in its 5th WHEREAS Clause as follows:\n\n*The Government should grant a juridical stability system to foreign investors by the acknowledgement of certain guaranties* *securing the continuity of the established rules**,* (emphasis added)\n\nIt provides that the Competent National Organization (in our case CONITE) may enter into agreements guaranteeing among other the following rights:\n\n*c)* *Stability of the right to non-discrimination established in Article 2\u00b0 hereof**,* (emphasis added)\n\nCLA-1\n\n88.\n\nArticle 2 of this same Decree reads as follows:\n\n*Foreign investors and the companies in which these participate have the same rights and obligations as the local investors and companies**. Such rights and obligations are only limited by the exceptions established in the Political Constitution of Peru and the provisions hereof,* (emphasis added)\n\n*In no case the domestic juridical regulations will discriminate among investors or the companies based on the local or foreign share in the investments**,* (emphasis added)\n\n89.\n\nThe conclusion from the plain wording of the Agreement and the various legal texts referred to in the Agreement, and underlying the juridical stability regime of Peru, can only be that the legal framework in the crucial various fields enumerated in the Agreement will not be modified, either in favor of or to the detriment of the foreign investor, Aguaytia, during the ten years duration of the Agreement. Nowhere, however, are any individual, substantive rights created or guaranteed. What is guaranteed is the stability of the legislative framework as it existed on 17 May 1996.\n\n90.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, *\"even if a literal interpretation did support Peru\u2019s position, such an interpretative approach can only be the start of the exercise, and in applying**the other factors, such as context and good faith, a very different picture would**emerge.\"49*\n\nCII, \u00a7 46\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant then turns to the \"Drafting Intent Interpretation\"50. Claimant points out that the Agreement is principally a standard form contract with little scope for the negotiation of its terms and the Claimant agrees that *\"no such substantive negotiations took place. AEL did not benefit from any insight into what the drafters of the standard form had intended - it could only judge what it would receive from the words of the Conite Agreement itself and the objective context against which it was entered into.\"51*\n\nCII, p. 16\n\nCII, \u00a747.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant has not drawn the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal to any contemporaneous documents reflecting its understanding of the Agreement at the time it entered into it. The Agreement contains in Article III five different areas which were being stabilized. The Claimant has not adduced any documentation regarding its contemporaneous evaluation of these different rights. Especially, why the stability of the right to non discrimination, as now interpreted by the Claimant, would have been of particular importance to it, nor why it could consider at the time it entered into the Agreement, that it contained a substantive right that it would not in any way be discriminated by future actions of the State. The Claimant also did not identify any Peruvian authority or publicly available arbitral authority to the effect that a Stability Agreement stabilizing laws of non discrimination constitutes, in effect, a warranty or representation by the State that there will not be discrimination against the Contracting Party as had been asked by Arbitrator Rowley.52\n\nTranscript 96, 22; 97,1-6\n\n93.\n\nOf course *\"the guarantee is said to run to the \"investor\u2019s rights'\"* and they have been *\"acknowledged as being given to protect the investor\u2019s \"long-term investment\"*,53 This, however, in no way implies a substantive right protecting against future discrimination.\n\nCll, \u00a754.\n\n94.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, such a reading, that the Agreement does not convey any substantive rights, would have the following consequences\n\n*\"The word \"stability\" is defined (in other laws) in such a narrow way that the guarantee (i) has no effective meaning, such that a subsidiary organ of the State may actively discriminate, in violation of the allegedly stabdized right to non-discrimination, without the State being in breach of the guarantee in Clause 3(5); and (ii) its meaning is directly contradictory to the Parties\u2019 express agreement as to the meaning of the guarantee.\"54*\n\nClaimant's Closing Presentation, pp. 6 and 7.\n\n95.\n\nFirst of all, the Claimant has not produced any evidence which supports its allegation that such an interpretation would be *\"directly contradictory to the Parties\u2019 express**agreement\".* Furthermore, it is beyond doubt that stability undertakings, such as those entered into by the Respondent in the Agreement and contained in Article III, are of undoubted importance for investors. There is no need here to dwell on the importance for investors, obviously including the Claimant, of the stability guarantees given in the field of taxes, foreign currency, free remittance of profits and capital and exchange rates. Also, the *\"stability of the right to non-discrimination\"* itself is of obvious importance for a foreign investor. It freezes the laws, rules and regulations applicable to it, as they were in existence at the time the Agreement was concluded. This means that no new law may be passed which would state that certain rules regarding nondiscrimination would no longer apply to the Claimant. It especially guaranteed the constitutional right to equality before the law55 (for instance a Peruvian Legislature hostile to foreign investment could not have, during the duration of the Agreement, worsened the status of the Claimant by modifying this constitutional right that foreign investment would not be treated different from national investments).\n\nSee above \u00a7 59 and Decision of the Constitutional Tribunal of Peru of 30 January 2004 (CLA-21).\n\n96.\n\nIt is also clear from the wording of the Agreement that the guarantees it contains concerning juridical stability do not convey a most favored investor status. Whether and to what degree such a status is possibly available to the Claimant is a question to be resolved solely by the Peruvian authorities in applying the non-discrimination provisions of the Constitution and the specific laws applicable in this context. However, this ICSID Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the question, either in the first instance or by way of an appeal against decisions of Peruvian Courts and administrative bodies as the Agreement does not grant any substantive rights.\n\n97.\n\nThe claim of the Claimant is therefore denied.\n\n**6. COSTS**\n------------\n\n98.\n\nArticle 9, paragraph 2 of the Agreement (the arbitration clause) provides:\n\n*Any expenses to be incurred in enforcing this Article shall be borne in equal parts by the parties hereto.*\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant in its Opening Memorial requested as part of its relief the award of :\n\n*(i) its share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of ICSID\u2019s facilities; and*\n\n*(ii) its legal and related fees in connection with these proceedings.56*\n\npp. 62 and 63.\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent in its Counter-Memorial stated :\n\n*Article 9 of the Aguaytia Stability Agreement expressly provides: \"Any expenses incurred as a result of the application of this Clause shall be borne by the contracting parties in equal parts.\" Claimant thus cannot recover costs.57*\n\n\u00a7 399, p. 127.\n\n101.\n\nClaimant in its Reply Memorial did not rebut the position of the Respondent, nor did it repeat its claim for costs. The matter was not raised by the Parties during the Hearing.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore need not decide whether Article 9(2) of the Agreement deals with all costs incurred by the Parties (including legal fees, fees and expenses of witnesses, etc.) or covers only the amounts paid to ICSID. In view of the interpretation given by the Respondent to Article 9(2) of the Agreement (and not rebutted by the Claimant), and in view of the outcome of these proceedings, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have to apply the basic rule contained in Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. Each Party shall therefore bear its own legal costs and expenses and shall equally share the payments requested by ICSID and made by the Parties.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n**Decides and awards as follows:**\n\n1. Denies the claim of the Claimant.\n\n2. The Claimant and the Respondent shall bear their own legal costs and expenses and share equally the payments requested by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes and made by the Parties."}]}
