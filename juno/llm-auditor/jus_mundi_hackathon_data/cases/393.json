PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 3 December 2012, in accordance with the calendar for the arbitration set forth in Annex B to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent submitted its Objection to Jurisdiction as well as its Application for Bifurcation. On 24 December 2012, the Claimant submitted its Answer to the Request for Bifurcation.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 positions, insofar as relevant to the issue of bifurcation, are set forth below.\n\na) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n----------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it has not consented to arbitrate this dispute as the Claimant did not respect the conditions precedent for submitting a claim to arbitration under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA. The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on this ground and submits that bifurcation of this jurisdictional objection is appropriate, as it will increase the efficiency of these proceedings. In support of its submission, the Respondent relies on Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which, according to the Respondent, establish the presumption that a tribunal should address jurisdictional issues as a preliminary question. The Respondent also quotes Redfern and Hunter to the effect that bifurcation of an objection to jurisdiction \"enables the parties to know where they stand at an early stage; and it will save them spending time and money on arbitral proceedings that prove to be invalid\".\n\n4.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, deciding questions of jurisdiction as a preliminary matter separate from the merits is a common practice in international arbitration. In *Glamis Gold* v. USA,1 the Tribunal determined that a request that an objection be considered as a preliminary matter should be granted unless bifurcation is unlikely to bring about increased efficiency in the proceedings. The Tribunal further explained that bifurcation would bring about increased efficiency where: (1) the objection is substantial rather than frivolous; (2) resolving the objection as a preliminary matter will result in a material reduction of proceedings at the next phase; and (3) the facts and issues to be addressed in the jurisdictional phase are so distinct from the facts and issues of the merits phase that having a single proceeding would not result in savings of cost and time. The Respondent submits that all these factors are satisfied in the present case.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd v. The United States of America* (UNCITRAL) Procedural Order No.2 (Revised), 31 May 2005 (\"Glamis\").\n\n5.\n\nFirst, according to the Respondent, its objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is substantial and not frivolous. The Claimant's failure to respect the requirement in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA that it wait six months after the events giving rise to its claim before starting the arbitration cannot be ignored. The Respondent relies *inter alia* on *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Ecuador2* and *Burlington v. Ecuador3* to submit that the failure to abide by a waiting period results in a lack of consent and thus a lack of jurisdiction.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4) Award on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2010.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5) Award on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010.\n\n6.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that a decision by the Tribunal in its favour will result in a dismissal of the entire claim or, at least, in a material reduction of the measures that must be considered in the merits phase. This will in turn result in significant savings of costs. Such savings are especially important as Canada is implementing a deficit reduction program which imposes serious constraints on its operations. In these circumstances, according to the Respondent, the potential for cost reductions in expenditures of public funds should be given considerable weight.\n\n7.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that this jurisdictional issue is distinct from the merits of the case. It emphasizes that there is little dispute over any of the facts relevant to the jurisdictional defense, i.e. over the dates when certain measures were taken and when the purported Notice of Arbitration was filed. The sole question is the interpretation of Article 1120(1) of NAFTA. No efficiencies will therefore be gained by hearing this particular jurisdictional objection alongside the merits.\n\n8.\n\nFinally, the Respondent mentions other \"potential jurisdictional objections\" concerning the nationality of the Claimant, its alleged ownership of investments in Canada and the attribution of responsibility for acts of the Ontario Power Authority to Canada. If these objections were later raised, their bifurcation would not be efficient. Unlike with respect to the defense related to the waiting period, Canada accepts that these potential objections need not be heard on a preliminary basis and that they be joined to the merits.\n\n9.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to \"bifurcate the proceedings and hear the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal based on the Claimant\u2019s failure to respect the conditions precedent for submitting a claim to arbitration as a preliminary matter.\"\n\nb) The Claimant\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation is premised entirely on the basis that the Respondent has not consented to arbitrate this dispute. However, Canada\u2019s consent to arbitration is granted in Article 1122 of the NAFTA and compliance with the waiting period is not a prerequisite to the Tribunals\u2019 jurisdiction. Relying on several commentators, the Claimant submits that \"waiting period\" provisions similar to Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA are purely procedural and not a matter of jurisdiction. In support of its position, the Claimant cites SGS v. *Pakistan4* where it was held that \"[t]ribunals have generally tended to treat consultation periods as directory and procedural rather than as mandatory and jurisdictional in nature. Compliance with such a requirement is, accordingly, not seen as amounting to a condition precedent for the vesting of jurisdiction.\"\n\nSGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003.\n\n11.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, bifurcation is a practical question to be determined by reference to principles of arbitral efficiency and economy. A series of measures impugned by the Claimant predate the Notice of Arbitration by at least six months. These cannot be assessed and determined without a full hearing. In fact, the Respondent has itself acknowledged that some of the impugned measures would, in any event, require a hearing. In this context, bifurcation would not promote or provide significant costs savings. It would be the exact opposite.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that to the extent Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA raises any question of law at all, it is certainly not one that can be determined in the abstract. A full examination of the entire factual matrix in which the claim arises would be required. The events of 3 June (changes to the FIT interconnection rules) and 4 July 2011 (announcing the FIT Power Purchase Agreements) are directly connected to earlier events granting special and more favorable treatment to the Claimant\u2019s competitors. These earlier events arose in January 2011, 10 months prior to the submission of the Notice of Arbitration. The Respondent\u2019s breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the impugned actions and lasting for as long as governmental actions were not in conformity. Consequently, the determination whether the events of January through July 2011 constitute a breach of the NAFTA requires a full consideration of all the evidence, including witnesses and experts. Bifurcation would therefore require the Claimant to prove its case twice.\n\n13.\n\nFinally, in response to the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the decisions in Murphy and Burlington, the Claimant submits that those cases are easily distinguishable. The text of the US-Ecuador BIT requires a waiting period from the date the investor notifies the respondent of the dispute. This is not applicable to Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. Further, the US-Ecuador BIT uses the word \"dispute\" rather than the word \"events\" seen in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. This imposes a notice requirement that is completely different from Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. The Claimant submits that the \"notice\" provisions in Murphy and Burlington are akin to Article 1119 of the NAFTA pursuant to which the Respondent has a right to be advised and informed of the dispute.\n\n14.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to deny the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n15.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the purpose of this Order is to decide whether to bifurcate the present proceedings between, on the one hand, the issue regarding the Claimant\u2019s alleged non-compliance with Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA and, on the other, all other objections that may arise and the merits. At this stage, it is not to decide whether or not the Claimant complied with the requirements of Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. The Tribunal will decide this latter issue at the relevant time as provided in the calendar for this arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[i]n general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary matter\". It follows that when a Party raises an objection to jurisdiction, the presumption is in favor of addressing the objection as a preliminary question. Indeed, it is good practice to let the parties \"know where they stand\" - to use Redfern and Hunter's words - at an early stage and not to impose the burden of full fledged proceedings on a party that disputes being subject to arbitration. There are obviously circumstances when the presumption must be discarded, in particular when the preliminary objection is frivolous or dilatory or when the facts it involves are the same or closely linked to those pertinent to the merits.\n\n17.\n\nIn this respect, the decision in *Glamis* helpfully illustrates the factors to be borne in mind while determining an application for bifurcation. Applying these factors in this case, the Tribunal sees potential merit in the requested bifurcation. This conclusion, however, is reached with a reservation. While at the present stage, it appears to the Tribunal that the separate presentation of the Respondent\u2019s objection concerning Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA and other possible jurisdictional issues and the merits could lead to a more efficient proceeding, the Tribunal does not exclude the possibility that, once the issue is explored further with the benefit of the Parties\u2019 further briefing, it may transpire that a determination cannot be made without substantially engaging with the merits of the dispute, such that the objection ought then to be re-joined to the merits. The Tribunal considers it necessary expressly to reserve this possibility.\n\n18.\n\nReverting to the factors enumerated in *Glamis,* the Tribunal notes first, that the Respondent\u2019s objection does not appear frivolous. The Notice of Arbitration is dated 4 October 2011. At least two of the impugned measures (dated 3 June and 4 July 2011 respectively) fall within the six month notice period stipulated in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. The Claimant itself does not dispute this observation, submitting instead that these measures are directly connected to earlier measures falling outside the six month period. As the Respondent points out, some tribunals have found that the failure to abide by a waiting period requirement results in a denial of jurisdiction. The Claimant cites other decisions to the effect that waiting periods are mere procedural requirements, not affecting jurisdiction. Whatever the correct position, it cannot be denied that the Respondent\u2019s objection concerning Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA, if found to be valid, could have an effect on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nSecond, if it were to succeed, the objection in issue is likely to at least narrow the scope of issues to be briefed at the merits stage. Bifurcating the proceedings may thus result in a reduction in the time and costs of any future phase of the proceedings. In such event, the Respondent would not be put to the burden of defending the entire case on the merits.\n\n20.\n\nThird, at this juncture, the Tribunal believes that the facts involved in determining the objection in issue are distinct from those likely to be involved in determining the merits of the claims. Similarly, the application of Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA gives rise to legal questions that are likely to be separate and distinct from those arising on the merits. These questions may well be answered without entering into the full array of facts pertinent to the merits. At present, it thus appears to the Tribunal that the issues to be analysed under Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA are unlikely to overlap with the issues to be reviewed at the merits phase. Consequently, separating the presentation of the objection in question and the rest of the proceedings should, in principle, lead to a more efficient proceeding.\n\n21.\n\nIn conclusion, on the basis of the record as it stands, the Tribunal sees merit in the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation. However, it cannot rule out that, after having reviewed the Claimant's Answer on Jurisdiction (on compliance with Article 1120(1) NAFTA) due on 18 February 2013 and the Reply and Rejoinder on the same issue, if any, it may find it preferable to re-join the objection in issue to the merits. As noted, this eventuality is expressly reserved.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n22.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\na) Grants the Respondent's request to bifurcate the present proceedings between (i) the jurisdictional objection based on the alleged failure of the Claimant to comply with Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA, and (ii) the merits of the case and any and all other jurisdictional objections that may arise, subject to the Tribunal exercising its power, which it hereby reserves, to re-join the said objection to the merits of the case following receipt of the Answer and, if any, the Reply and Rejoinder to the said objection, with or without holding a separate hearing on the said objection;\n\nb) Directs the Parties to follow the scenario of the procedural calendar set forth in Annex B to Procedural Order No. 1 that assumes bifurcation; and\n\nc) Reserves costs for subsequent determination."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-03-24T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Charles N.

That formulation was set out by the tribunal in *Waste Management II* and has been adopted by a number of other tribunals, including most recently the *Bilcon* tribunal.1 It provides that:\n\nthe minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.2\n\n*William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware Inc. v.

Up until then Claimant\u2019s projects, as well as all other FIT applicants, had been competing for capacity that had been 500 MW or greater. Moreover, - and this can only be characterized as grotesque - as it actually happened, the Korean Consortium was thereby enabled to acquire low-ranked FIT applicants in order to fill its allotted 500 MW, thereby jumping clear losers in the FIT Program over higher-ranked, but ultimately unsuccessful FIT applicants, due to the reduced available megawattage. This effectively stood the FIT Program on its head, turned it upside down. Thus the Government of Ontario acted arbitrarily, grossly unfairly, unjustly, idiosyncratically, discriminated against the FIT applicants and in favor of the Korean Consortium, and acted with a complete lack of transparency and candor.\n\n5.\n\nJust how the GEIA made a mockery of the FIT Program, and consciously was designed to do so, is clear from the history that follows.\n\n6.\n\nThe terms of the GEIA are compelling as to Respondent\u2019s intent. As set out under Recital (A), Respondent was \"committed to developing, enhancing and diversifying the Province of Ontario\u2019s renewable energy power generation capacity, and [wished] to supplement the Province of Ontario\u2019s significant and growing commitment to renewable energy power generation with the development of manufacturing capability... \"3 Under Recital (B), the GEIA\u2019s objective was to give the Korean Consortium sole direct access to 2,500 MW \"to develop, construct and operate wind and solar generation projects in Ontario.\n\n... and, with its Manufacturing Partners, to establish and operate facilities in Ontario for the manufacture of wind and solar generation equipment and components (the \"Project\")...,\"4\n\n**Ex. C-0322,** *Green Energy Investment Agreement* dated January 21, 2010.\n\n*Id.*\n\n7.\n\nUnder Article 7.3(b), Respondent furthered the above objectives by contractually pledging to \"[g]uarantee priority access to, the Bulk Transmission System capacity allocated under the FIT Program, and availability of connection access [thereto]\"5 to the extent of 500 MW. This was despite the existence of the FIT Program, of which both the Korean Consortium and Respondent were fully cognizant and whose awareness thereof was expressly reflected, repeatedly, in the GEIA.6\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* The GEIA is replete with references to the FIT Program and the FIT Rules: Article 1.1 defines \u2018\"FIT\"\u2019 as \"Feed-In Tariff\u2019, \u2018\"FIT Contract\u2019\" as \"the meaning ascribed thereto in the FIT Rules\", \"\u2018FIT Program\u2019\" as \"the Feed-In Tariff program as it exists from time to time arising from a direction or directions issued by the Minister pursuant to s. 25.35 of the *Electricity Act, 1998\",* \"\u2018FIT Rules\u2019\" as \"the rules set out in the Feed-in Tariff Program as same may be amended in accordance with its terms from time to time\", \u2018\"Aboriginal Price Adder\u2019\" has the same meaning as \"ascribed... in the FIT Rules\", \u2018\"Access Rights\u2019\" has the same meaning as \"ascribed... in the FIT Rules\", \"\u2018Commercial Operation Date\u2019 means, in respect of a Generation Facility, the day on which the facility achieves Commercial Operation, as defined in the FIT Contract\", \"\u2018Community Price Adder\u2019\" has the same meaning as \"ascribed in the FIT Rules\", \"\u2018Control\u2019\" has the same meaning as ascribed \"in the FIT Rules\", and \u2018\"Domestic Content\u2019 means the target under the FIT Rules for domestic and provincial manufacturing\". The following articles in the GEIA also refer to the FIT, FIT Rules, FIT Contract and/or FIT Program: Articles 4.1, 6.2, 7.3(b) & (c), 8.7, 8.8, 9.1, 9.2 & 10.3.\n\n8.\n\nThe Korean Consortium was permitted to undertake any phase of the Project through one or more entities - known as a \"Project Company\". Article 1.1 of the GEIA states that \u2018\"Project Company\u2019\" has the meaning set out in Article 4.1,\" which in turn \"provide[s] that [the Korean Consortium] shall retain Control [defined in Article 1.1 as having \"the meaning ascribed thereto in the FIT Rules\"] of each Project Company until such Project Company enters into a PPA [power purchase agreement] with the OPA [Ontario Power Agency] and thereafter the provisions in the FIT Contract related to Control and assignment shall apply to the Project Company.\"7 Once such a Project Company submitted the necessary details to the OPA, Respondent was obligated to \"cause OPA to be directed to negotiate and enter into a PPA with the Project Company...\"8 In other words, while FIT participants were vying for PPAs under the FIT Program, Respondent could hand them to the Korean Consortium on a silver platter. For this purpose, the same Article 4.1 also envisioned the Korean Consortium contracting with \"strategic partners,\" and in fact the Korean Consortium chose as its \"strategic partner\" the Claimant\u2019s major competitor, Pattern Energy Group LP (\"Pattern\") of San Francisco.9\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* Article 9.1 in full reads: \"The Parties agree that the payment for Hourly Delivered Electricity generated by each Phase of the Project shall be effected through one or more PPAs between Project Companies and the OPA. If a Project Company submits to the OPA connection details and evidence of necessary Access Rights as specified in Section 3.1(d) and (e) of the FIT Rules for a Phase (or part thereof) and it so advises the Government of Ontario and the OPA, the Government of Ontario shall cause OPA to be directed to negotiate and enter into a PPA with the Project Company for the procurement of the Electricity supply and capacity contemplated by such Phase (or part thereof). Such PPA shall be substantially in the form of the FIT Contract in use by the OPA at the time such PPA is being entered into as amended to give effect to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and with such other amendments thereto as the Parties may agree. Each such PPA will provide that the price payable by the OPA for the Electricity supply and capacity subject to such agreement will be the aggregate of,  \n (a) for wind, the price as specified in the then current Price Schedule, and  \n (b) for solar, in Phase 1 and Phase 2, 44.3 cents per kWh and in Phase 3, Phase 4 and Phase 5, the price as specified in the then current Price Schedule,  \n(the **\"base prices\")** plus, the Economic Development Adder, as applicable, and any other adder to which the Project Company would be entitled had it made application for a FIT Contract pursuant to the FIT Rules. Each such PPA will constitute a \u2018Procurement Contract\u2019 for the purposes of the *Electricity Act, 1998.* Upon execution of a PPA, the rights and obligations of the Parties with respect to the Phase (or part thereof where the Phase has been subdivided) shall be governed exclusively by that PPA.\"\n\n**Ex. C-0537,** *Transcript of Mr. Colin Edwards\u2019 Deposition, 3 August 2012,* at p. 65, Ins. 2-14.\n\n9.\n\nTo ensure that the Project would run smoothly, Article 5.2 of the GEIA established a \"Working Group\" comprised of \"eight (8) members, with equal membership from the Korean Consortium and the Government of Ontario, which [met] regularly throughout the term of [the] Agreement...,\"10 The Korean Consortium thus had a direct channel of communication to Respondent that no FIT participant had.11\n\n*See supra* n. 3.\n\nTestimony of Bob Chow, Tr. Day 3, p. 301, In. 25, p. 302, Ins. 1-5:  \n [Q:] Korean Consortium got the benefit of the working group and not members of the FIT program; right?  \n A. Under that agreement, yes, we have been helpful on that.\n\n10.\n\nAlready while the GEIA negotiations were ongoing, in August 2009, Pattern entered into negotiations with the Korean Consortium.12 Pattern, in parallel with its discussions with the Korean Consortium, also submitted ten applications to the FIT Program in November 2009. One application was awarded a FIT Contract in February 2010 - the Merlin project with a mere 10 MW capacity.13 By late July 2010, Pattern and, on behalf of the Korean Consortium, Samsung entered into a joint venture agreement whereby Pattern was to collaborate exclusively with the Korean Consortium to develop the first 1,000 MW under the GEIA.14 Following Respondent\u2019s 500 MW allocation to the Korean Consortium in September 2010, Pattern in October 2010 terminated the 10 MW Merlin project awarded under the FIT Program and, instead, caused it to be absorbed under GEIA.15\n\n*See supra* n. 9 at p. 27, Ins. 7-23.\n\n*Id.* at p. 48, Ins. 4-19; Rejoinder Witness Statement of Shawn Cronkwright dated 2 July 2014 at \u00b6 12.\n\n*See supra* n. 9 at p. 61, Ins. 18-22.\n\n*Id.* at p. 51, Ins. 22-25, p. 52, Ins. 1-12; **Ex.

It even attended some of the \"\u2018Working Group\u2019\" meetings of Respondent and the Korean Consortium, despite not being a member of it.16 When Pattern\u2019s involvement in the Working Group meetings was resisted, Pattern argued that its role was \" *beyond merely co-sponsoring PPAs...* [and that] *Samsung [had] expressed a preference to [Pattern that they] be included in future discussions with you [i.e. Ontario] around the GEIA.. \"17*\n\n**Ex.

Do you know if anyone at Samsung had such discussions?\n\nA With Ontario?\n\nQ  Yes.\n\nA About the GEIA?\n\nQ  About the \u2014 the \u2014 as you put it, the GEIA program being an alternative for the Power Purchase Agreement to the FIT program.\n\nA **The very nature of the GEIA would suggest they were having conversations.**\n\nQ  And you weren't present at any such conversations, personally?\n\nA No.\n\nQ  What do you mean by the very nature of it?\n\nA **It is an agreement that was included as part of the Green Energy Act, and it's an agreement between Samsung and Ontario; so they must have been having discussions to reach agreement**\n\nQ  No. Right. I guess I was simply asking, though, this notion that it would be an alternative to having to go through the FIT program \u2014\n\nA I don't know.19\n\nQ  Did you ever talk with them about how the GEIA ended up being a much better deal for Pattern than it would have been had Pattern simply gone through a power \u2014 a FIT contract?\n\nA Are you asking if Pattern had discussions with Ontario that this was a more advantageous opportunity for Pattern?\n\nQ  Yes.\n\nA I don\u2019t recall.\n\nQ  Did you have such discussions with Samsung?\n\nMR. AMDURSKY: I\u2019m going to object again that it goes beyond the scope of today\u2019s deposition.\n\nTHE WITNESS [MR. EDWARDS]: **The fact that we signed a joint venture agreement and elected to participate with Samsung is evidence that we thought this was a better opportunity.20** (Emphasis added).\n\n*See supra* n. 9 at p. 35, Ins. 15-25.\n\n*See supra* n. 9 at p. 36, Ins. 1-6, 14-25; p. 37, Ins. 1-2, 18-25; p. 38, Ins. 1-25; p. 39 Ins. 1-5.\n\n*Id.* atp. 193, Ins. 13-25; p. 194, Ins. 1-3.\n\n13.\n\nUpon the release of the revised FIT rankings on 4 July 201121, the Korean Consortium and Pattern began eyeing FIT projects for the GEIA Project. The revised July 2011 rankings identified TTD and Arran at the top - at 3rd and 4th respectively. Despite these high rankings, neither of Claimant\u2019s projects secured a FIT Contract. On 6 July 2011, Mr. George Hardie of Pattern wrote to Mr. Cole Robertson and Mr. Mark Ward of Mesa expressing sympathy, but also acknowledging the obviously negative impact on Claimant\u2019s applications of the 500 MW that had been removed from the FIT Program by the GEIA. Entirely predictably, Pattern sought to acquire Claimant\u2019s Arran and TTD [also known as \"22 Degrees\"] projects:\n\nCole and Mark,\n\nI am writing to let you know that we were surprised to see that your Arran and 22 Degree sites did not secure FIT contracts - as we were pretty sure you\u2019d get contracts for at least one and probably both of the sites. And, on a personal level, I\u2019m genuinely disappointed for you guys. I can say, however, with 100% certainty that our current POI\u2019s did not have any impact on the FIT award outcome **- although the Samsung 500 MW transmission allocation obviously didn\u2019t help matters.**\n\nIn any event, and now that the dust has settled so to speak, we may still be interested in acquiring one or more of your sites. If there is interest on your part in transacting please let me know ASAP as time is truly of the essence. Specifically, our intention would be to enter into a binding term sheet immediately with closing conditional only upon our being awarded a GEIA FIT contract in the next 6-8 weeks (read before the election)...,22 (Emphasis added).\n\n**Ex.

By August 2011, the Korean Consortium had acquired two low-ranked projects in the Bruce region that never stood a chance of obtaining a FIT Contract, but were nevertheless granted PPAs under GEIA. First, the Korean Consortium acquired the Armow project from Acciona,25 which was ranked 21st in the Bruce region.26 Second, the Korean Consortium acquired the K2 wind project from Capital Power,27 which was ranked 24th in the Bruce region.28 Thus, these projects were well behind TTD and Arran, which had been ranked 3rd and 4th respectively.29\n\n**Ex.

Ontario was perfectly justified in wanting to attract such investment for the benefit of the Province, its inhabitants and its industrial base. That is not the point. The point is that by tying a business attraction arrangement to a sweetheart deal guaranteeing, and then actually granting to the Korean Consortium, 500 MW of FIT access for which other companies had been competing on prescribed terms, the Government of Ontario pulled the rug out from under the general FIT Program to the extent of those 500 MW. The sin was in combining the two to the detriment of FIT applicants who were not part of the Korean Consortium and otherwise would have won contracts.\n\n17.\n\nThis misconduct cannot be excused, as the Award does, by noting that a sovereign is to be given a certain degree of deference and, in particular, that \"Article 1105 does not provide a guarantee against regulatory change.\"30 Of course \"[a] State may amend its laws and regulations as it deems appropriate in light of changing circumstances... [and] the FIT Program had undergone several amendments.\"31 Of course \"the FIT Rules expressly stipulate that they may be reviewed and amended.\"32 There is an acceptable range of potential change that the Province could lawfully effect, particularly to the extent that that right was expressly reserved within the confines of the FIT Program. That is far different, however, from contracting outside the FIT Program with a third party, in this case the Korean Consortium, to withdraw 500 MW from the MW target at which the other FIT applicants were aiming. It is not permissible under Article 1105 that the FIT Rules be \"reviewed and amended\" to accommodate what essentially was a Province-authorized intruder into the FIT Program. A jockey must ride one horse at a time.\n\nAward at \u00b6 619.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6620.\n\n18.\n\nThe very conduct of Ontario in respect of the GEIA betrays a sense of its knowing at the time that its actions were questionable at best. The first news of Ontario\u2019s negotiations with the Korean Consortium, which one subsequently learned had been going on since the summer of 2008,33 was a Toronto Star article entitled \"Ontario Eyes Green Job Bonanza\" published on 26 September 2009. Its text, set forth in large part in the Award,34 mostly was about \"manufacturing wind turbines and other green-energy gear - including solar panels,\" but did report Energy Minister Smitherman as noting that the Korean Consortium would be \"taking part in the [FIT] program.\"35 Clearly Minister Smitherman and the Korean Consortium deeply regretted this disclosure of their year-long negotiations, as they on the same day issued a joint press statement that \"information concerning [their] negotiations has prematurely entered the public domain... [which] [b]oth parties regret... even while serious negotiations are ongoing.\"36 It mentioned, however, only that \"Samsung... proposes to establish a new renewable energy business in Ontario where the Feed in Tariff was recently launched...\"37 It made no mention whatsoever of Samsung submitting applications itself under the FIT Program.\n\nSamsung initially approached the Government of Ontario in the summer of 2008. **Ex.

There had been a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding, and although the 26 September 2009 news release of the Ministry of Energy and the Korean Consortium referred to a forthcoming \"historic framework agreement,\"42 there in fact never was a framework agreement, but only a draft of GEIA.43 The press reports mentioned earlier, and subsequent ones, may have served to discourage some potential FIT applicants, but that does nothing to change the fact that it was only as of 21 January 2010 that Ontario became legally obligated to grant the Korean Consortium unchallengeable access to the 500 MW here in issue. Until then the public applicants were competing on an equal basis in a fair game. By that date, as the Award confirms,44 it was well established that \"there were thousands and thousands of megawatts of interest of project development in Ontario.... So I knew that there would be more demand for FIT contracts than there would be supply of contract capacity.\"45 In other words, when Ontario committed itself to award the Korean Consortium 500 MW pursuant to the GEIA it knew for sure that it was interfering with the ongoing FIT Program, depriving the publicly competing applicants of that amount of megawattage and, as noted above, enabling otherwise losing FIT applicants to recoup at least some of their doomed investments by selling out to the Korean Consortium, which then could fill its 500 MW allotment with them and thereby deprive higher-ranked FIT applicants of their just rewards (due to the reduced available megawattage).\n\nAward at \u00b6 596.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6612.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6575.\n\nTestimony of Jim MacDougall, Tr.

The Ministry negotiated a contract with a consortium of Korean companies to build renewable energy projects. The consortium will receive two additional incentives over the life of the contract if it meets its job-creation targets: a payment of $437 million (reduced to $110 million, as announced by the Ministry in July 2011 after the completion of our audit fieldwork) in addition to the already attractive FIT prices; and priority access to Ontario\u2019s electricity transmission system, whose capacity to connect renewable energy projects is already limited. However, no economic analysis or business case was done to determine whether the agreement with the consortium was economically prudent and cost-effective, and neither the OEB nor the OPA was consulted about the agreement....46\n\n[The GEIA was a] privately negotiated contract between the Ministry and the Korean consortium.47\n\n**Agreement with the Korean Consortium**\n\nWhile the FIT program was intended to provide a channel for renewable energy investments by homeowners, farmers, small businesses, and community groups, the Ministry was also negotiating with a consortium of Korean companies under separate terms to build more renewable energy projects. The consortium, led by two large Korean companies, approached the Ministry in June 2008 and proposed to make a major investment in Ontario\u2019s renewable energy sector. This led to ongoing talks between the Ministry and the consortium and the signing of a memorandum of understanding in December 2008. In June 2009, the Minister travelled to Korea for more discussions; six months later, the Minister, on behalf of the government, signed the $7-billion Green Energy Investment Agreement (GEIA) with the consortium. The consortium committed to build 2,000 MW of wind projects and 500 MW of solar projects in Ontario in five phases by 2016, with the equipment to be manufactured in this province. Neither the OEB nor the OPA was consulted about the agreement. The OPA was not involved until summer 2009, when the Ministry inquired about available transmission capacity to accommodate consortium projects.... [W]e noted that the normal due diligence process for an expenditure of this magnitude had not been followed. For large projects such as the consortium agreement, we expected but did not find that a comprehensive and detailed economic analysis or business case had been prepared....48\n\n**Allocation of Capacity to Korean Consortium**\n\n... In April 2010, the Minister directed the OPA to give priority to connecting the consortium projects to the grid when assessing the availability of already-limited transmission capacity. This commitment to the consortium affected the FIT contract allocation process and the timely connection of renewable energy from other generators...,\"49\n\n*See supra* n. 39 at pp. 90-91.\n\n*Id.* at p. 98, Figure 6.\n\n*Id.* at pp. 107-108.\n\n*Id.* p. 116\n\n22.\n\nIt is noteworthy that those who were called upon to implement both the FIT Program and the FIT aspects of the GEIA reacted to the clash of the two with concern. For example, OPA Manager Jim MacDougall testified at the hearing that he was not \"terribly pleased by the competing development opportunities that were running in parallel,\"50 as \"the existence of the Korean Consortium commitment... created greater pressure on the FIT program and less capacity availability through the FIT program to offer contracts.\"51 Indeed, even the Award concedes that it \"might have seemed to make sense [to \u2018have chosen not to sign the formal agreement in January 2010\u2019] considering that it was known in 2009 that the GEIA would impact the limited available transmission capacity\"52; that \"the actual need for an \u2018anchor tenant\u2019 could be questioned\" as \"[b]y the time the GEIA was signed in January 2010 (as opposed to its precursor MOU signed in December 2008), it was known that the applications under the FIT Program far exceeded the available capacity\"53; and that \"[the Korean Consortium] arguably had no experience with developing wind or solar power.\"54 Surprisingly, the Award nonetheless concludes: \"Be that as it may, these are all policy considerations and questions that were for the government of Ontario alone. It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to act as an appellate body in this regard, or second guess or weigh the wisdom of Ontario\u2019s decision to enter into the GEIA at the time - even if sufficient renewable energy would possibly have been available through the FIT Program,\"55 citing *Paushok* v. *Mongolia's* conclusion that \"Claimants have not succeeded in demonstrating that this was an abusive or irrational decision.\"56 I beg to differ: Signing GEIA when the FIT Program already had proven more than sufficient to supply the desired megawattage was abusive in that it was, in the words of *Waste Management II,* arbitrary, grossly unjust, unfair and idiosyncratic, discriminated against the otherwise successful FIT applicants in favor of the Korean Consortium, and was done with a complete lack of transparency and candor. Once more, its perhaps most egregious feature was that it enabled the Korean Consortium to fill its secure 500 MW by scavenging among the lowest-ranked FIT applicants, enabling them to sell to it and thus realize on their otherwise doomed investments, causing higher-ranked FIT applicants who otherwise would have been awarded contracts to be denied them solely due to the disappearance of 500 MW from the targeted availability.\n\nTestimony of Jim MacDougall, Tr.

In the event, this choice and the manner in which it was implemented created certain problems, and might well have been handled differently. But judged in all the circumstances, this is not criticism that reaches the threshold of a violation of Canada\u2019s international obligations.\"57 I say it did breach Article 1105.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 682.\n\n24.\n\nThe record in this case leaves no doubt that without GEIA, hence without its diminution by 500 MW of capacity in the Bruce Region, Claimant\u2019s FIT applications for Arran and TTD would have succeeded. Canada\u2019s own expert on the subject, Mr. Christopher Goncalves, Co-Chair and Director of BRG Energy and Natural Resources (Berkeley Research Group), testified at the hearing on 30 October 2014, using 20 slides collectively labeled \"Summary Of BRG Analysis\" in the course of his initial presentation. Slide No. 12 was labeled \"GEIA Violation Only\" and subtitled \"Bruce Region Results - GEIA Counterfactual.\" The legend below that and preceding a chart read, in pertinent part, \"If only the GEIA is found in breach, Arran and TTD would have been awarded contracts....\" Mr. Goncalves was questioned by the Tribunal:\n\nMR. BROWER: Right, okay. Now, let\u2019s take your initial presentation that was on the screen and turn to slide 12. Are you there? It is slide 12.\n\nTHE WITNESS: l am.\n\nMR. BROWER: I understood your testimony to be, but please confirm or disaffirm it, that if the GEIA was found to be a breach of NAFTA, then you conclude that Arran and TTD would have won their contracts?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Correct.\n\nMR. BROWER: Okay.\n\nTHE WITNESS: That\u2019s right.\n\nTHE CHAIR: Do you here discuss the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, yes.\n\nTHE CHAIR: That is the only issue that is dealt with here on this slide.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Correct. That\u2019s the only thing I think would have impacted Mesa \u2014\n\nTHE CHAIR: Absolutely, yes.\n\nTHE WITNESS: \u2014 is the lack of access to transmission capacity, and I hope that it is clear \u2014 I know I was moving fast when I introduced this \u2014 that the difference between the prior slide, 11, the actual scenario where you have 750 megawatts of available transmission and this one on slide 12 is the additional 500 megawatts of capacity.\n\nSo you lift the available capacity back to the total by removing the Korean Consortium\u2019s 500 megawatts, and when you make \u2014 when you lift that available capacity, TTD and Arran would have gotten FIT contracts.\n\nMR. BROWER: Okay. So as-\n\nTHE WITNESS: Is that clear?\n\nMR. BROWER: Your testimony basically is, as an expert appearing on behalf of Canada in this case, you have no doubt but that if GEIA were found to be a breach, we may proceed on the basis that Arran and TTD were home free; they got their contracts?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Or in other words that they were harmed, yes.58\n\nTestimony of Mr. Christopher Goncalves, Tr.

Articles 11 08(7)(a) and (8)(b) (\"Procurement by a Party or a State Enterprise\")**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nI turn now to the Award\u2019s finding that the FIT Program constituted \"procurement\" within the meaning of that term in NAFTA\u2019s Articles 1108(7)(a) and (8)(b).\n\n26.\n\nI do agree that Article 1103, the most-favored-nation clause, does not give Claimant access to more favorable treaties to which Canada is a Party as regards this issue.\n\n27.\n\nArticles 1108(7)(a) and (8)(b) together immunize \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\" - not just \"procurement\" alone - from the application of other Articles invoked by Claimant, namely \"National Treatment\" (Article 1102), \"Most-Favored-Nation Treatment\" (Article 1103), certain \"Performance Requirements\" (Article 1106(l)(b), (c), (f) and (g) and (3)(a) and (b)), and \"Senior Management and Boards of Directors\" (Article 1107). I emphasize that the term to be interpreted is \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise,\" not just \"procurement.\" I disagree with the Award\u2019s view that \"it makes no difference... whether one focuses upon the single word *\u2018procurement'* or the phrase *\u2018procurement by a Party or a state enterprise. \"\u201959*\n\nAward at \u00b6 421. See also Award at \u00b6\u00b6 437-438.\n\n28.\n\nWhile Canada\u2019s General Notes to Appendix I of the Government Procurement Agreement (\"GPA\") do not fall within any of the interpretive items listed in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), I do think that the following statement in that context is relevant to determination of the \"ordinary meaning\" of \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise:\"\n\nProcurement in terms of Canadian coverage is defined as contractual transactions to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the government... It does not include... government provision of goods and services, given to individuals, firms, private institutions, and sub-central governments. It does not include procurements made with a view to commercial resale or made by one entity or enterprise or made by one entity or enterprise of Canada.\n\nThis accords with what I regard as a broad understanding in the field of \"government procurement\" as to what the \"ordinary meaning\" of that two-word term is, which I cannot distinguish from \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise.\" Accordingly, I do not accept that Webster\u2019s online dictionary, Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language, or any other English lexicon\u2019s definition of the single word \"procurement\" standing alone, on which the Award relies for \"ordinary meaning,\"60 is at all relevant. Similarly, the fact that \"procurement,\" standing alone, is \"achats\" (English: purchases) in NAFTA\u2019s French text and \"compras\" (English: purchases) in its Spanish text lacks relevance.\n\n*Id.* at n. 151\n\n29.\n\nWhile the Tribunal relies particularly on the earlier NAFTA Chapter 11 awards in both **ADF** and ***UPS*** as supporting its interpretation of \"procurement\" - as *ADF,* in my view mistakenly, addressed the word \"procurement\" alone and not as part of the term \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\" when it expressly relied on the \"ordinary or dictionary connotation\" of \"procurement\"61 - the fact remains that both **ADF** and ***UPS*** dealt with government procurement in what I regard as the ordinary meaning of that phrase: *ADF* involved the construction by the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States, at least in part with Federal funds, of a public highway interchange on public property, and in ***UPS*** the Canadian Customs Service contracted with a private entity to collect as its agent customs duties and excise taxes from the addressees of packages subject to such levies.\n\n*ADFv. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/l (2003). \u00b6161 and n. 158, cited in the Award\u2019s n. 151.\n\n30.\n\nI also do not agree that any interpretation of Chapter 8 of NAFTA, including the Article 1108 paragraphs and subparagraphs invoked in the Award, should be materially influenced by, as the Award says, the Tribunal\u2019s perception that \"[a]ll three NAFTA Parties appear to support the broad notion of procurement [not, I note again, \"procurement by a Party or state enterprise\"] as advanced by the tribunals in *ADF* and *UPS'62* (which cases I have just dealt with in paragraph 29. above). I have never experienced a case in which the other Party or Parties to a treaty subject to interpretation, appearing in a non-disputing capacity, have ever differed from the interpretation being advanced by the respondent State. Inevitably, they club together. Moreover, the interpretation given by a State Party in actual litigation cannot be regarded as an authentic interpretation. In the end (Article 2001(2)(c)), only three Ministers of the States Party to NAFTA, convened as the Free Trade Commission, can \"resolve disputes that may arise regarding [NAFTA\u2019s] interpretation or application.\" That does not mean that the Tribunal is in any way barred from interpreting NAFTA. To the contrary. It does suggest at least, however, that caution should be exercised, if not skepticism, when confronted by that with which the Tribunal is dealing in the Award\u2019s paragraph 410.\n\nAward at \u00b6410.\n\n31.\n\nAs I have noted in paragraph 28. above, neither GATT nor anything occurring within its realm falls within the list of interpretive sources in Article 31, or, for that matter, Article 32, of the VCLT. In any event, even the Award draws little comfort from that source, for as it points out, the Appellate Body in the case cited stated that \"[i]n a more technical sense, procurement usually refers to *formal procedures used by governments to acquire goods or services.\"*63 Thereby the Appellate Body tends to confirm my conclusion as to the ordinary meaning of \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6413.\n\n32.\n\nI further differ with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that \"[Articles 1001(1) and (5), 1201(2) and 1502(4)] provide little guidance on the interpretation of the term \u2018procurement\u2019 [\u2018by a Party or a state enterprise\u2019] in Article 1108(7)(a).\" First, NAFTA has a Preamble, which normally would be consulted. Second, \"[t]he objectives of [NAFTA]\" are set forth in Article 102(1) and only there. Third, Article 102(2) provides that64\n\nThe Parties shall interpret and apply provisions of this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with applicable rules of international law [which of course include the VCLT].\n\nOf course it is true that the various Chapters of NAFTA are somewhat like separate treaties on discrete subjects. Nevertheless, the Parties have placed them in a single treaty with a comprehensive title, and one cannot correctly \"focus on\" one Article of one Chapter alone. In that respect I recall that the \"context\" of a treaty as defined in Article 31 of the VCLT includes \"the text,\" meaning the entire text of the treaty, \"including its preamble and annexes.\" Given that wider approach dictated by the VCLT, it is indeed relevant that other Articles of NAFTA define \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\" (or equivalent phrases) compatibly with what I have indicated is the \"ordinary meaning\" of the phrase. Thus, Article 1001 \"Scope and Coverage\" of \"Chapter Ten: Government Procurement\" provides in its paragraph 1. that \"[t]his Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a party relating to procurement... (a) by a federal government entity..., a government enterprise..., or a state or provincial government entity.... (b) of goods..., services... or construction services....\" In addition, its paragraph 5. stipulates that \"... [p]rocurement does not include... (a) any form of government assistance, including cooperative agreements... and government provision of goods and services to persons or state, provincial and regional governments....\" Similarly, Article 1502(4) of \"Chapter Fifteen: Competition Policy, Monopolies and State Enterprises\" excludes from certain anti-monopoly provisions \"procurement by governmental agencies of goods or services for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods or the provision of services for commercial sale.\" Surely these other provisions of NAFTA are not to be disregarded in arriving at the proper interpretation of \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise.\"\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6417.\n\n33.\n\nFurthermore, for interpretive purposes I do not accept that the description of a provision as either a \"carve-in\" or a \"carve-out\" has any role to play.65 Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT regularly are described by international courts and tribunals as permitting neither a liberal nor a restrictive interpretation. VCLT Article 31 prohibits any weighting of terms other than as required by its proper application.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6\u00b6 426-427.\n\n34.\n\nIn conclusion on this issue, I disagree with the Tribunal\u2019s approach and result as regards its interpretation of \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise.\""}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arran | Arran Wind Project, ULC |\n| AWA | American Wind Alliance, LLC |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| Canada\u2019s Notes | General notes to Appendix 1 of the GPA |\n| Canada-Czech Republic FIPA | Canada-Czech Republic Foreign Investor Promotion and Protection Agreement, 2009 |\n| CanWEA | Canadian Wind Energy Association |\n| C-Mem. | Canada\u2019s Counter-Memorial and Reply on Jurisdiction dated 28 February 2014 |\n| DAT | Distribution Availability Test |\n| ECT | Economic Connection Test |\n| EDA | Economic Development Adder |\n| Exh.

MAIN FACTS**\n------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe following summary is meant to give a general overview of the present dispute. It does not Include all facts which may be of relevance, particularly as they emerged from the extensive evidence gathered at the hearing. To the extent relevant and useful, additional facts will be discussed In the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the disputed Issues.\n\n**A.** Background of Ontario\u2019s Electricity Sector\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe origins of Ontario's electricity system can be traced back to 1906, when the Government of Ontario (the **\"Government\")** established the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, which was later renamed Ontario Hydro. As a vertically Integrated monopoly, Ontario Hydro coordinated generation and transmission together.\n\n8.\n\nIn 1998, following the general trend to Introduce competition Into regulated monopoly sectors, the Government sought to modify the regulation and management of the electricity system In the province through the Energy Competition Act, the Electricity Act and the Ontario Energy Board Act. Ontario Hydro was restructured and its assets were distributed among separate corporate entitles. These successor entitles Included (I) the Independent Market Operator, later renamed Independent Electricity System Operator, **(\"IESO\"),** which was charged with administering the electricity market as well as directing the flow of electricity from generators to consumers through the transmission system; and (ii) Hydro One, Inc. **(\"Hydro One\"),** which assumed the transmission and rural distribution business of Ontario Hydro.\n\n9.\n\nThe Government again restructured the electricity system In 2002 and In 2004. In 2004, through the Electricity Restructuring Act, the Government created the Ontario Power Authority **(\"OPA\"),** which was to be responsible for long-term system planning, procurement of new generation through long term power purchase agreements, and the promotion of the diversification of Ontario's electricity supply with a particular emphasis on renewable energy.\n\n10.\n\nIn keeping with its Intention to eliminate Ontario\u2019s reliance on coal-fired generation facilities, the Government launched several Initiatives for the promotion of renewable sources of energy. Among these was the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program **(\"RESOP\"),** which by 2008 had resulted In 3145 20-year fixed-price contracts for the procurement of approximately 1,300 MW of renewably generated electricity.\n\n11.\n\nIn 2009, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the Government enacted the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 (the **\"GEGEA\")** to \"build a green economy.\"6 The GEGEA amended 15 existing statutes and constituted a new standalone legislation known as the Green Energy Act, 2009 (the **\"GEA\").** Notably, the GEGEA added section 25.35 to the Electricity Act authorizing the Minister of Energy of the Government (the **\"Minister of Energy\")** to direct the OPA to develop a feed-in tariff program (the **\"FIT Program\")** to promote the generation and consumption of renewable energy in the province. The OPA was to be responsible for Implementing the FIT Program, Including setting prices and administering contracts entered Into under that program.\n\nExh. R-057.\n\n**B.** The **FIT** Program\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nWork on designing the FIT Program began in early 2009. On 24 September 2009, after several stakeholder consultations, the Minister of Energy formally directed the OPA to create the FIT Program.7 The FIT Program was to achieve specified goals. One of these goals was that participants in the program satisfy prescribed domestic content requirements: developers who had a milestone date for commercial operation on or before 31 December 2011 would have to meet a domestic content requirement of 25%, and those with a later milestone date would have to meet a domestic content requirement of 50%. As will be seen below, the latter requirement applied to the Claimant\u2019s projects.\n\nExh. R-001.\n\n13.\n\nThe FIT Program was formally launched by the OPA on 1 October 2009. It was accompanied by the FIT Rules, which set the eligibility criteria for the program as well as the criteria for evaluating applications to the FIT Program. These Rules were amended on several occasions.\n\n14.\n\nUnder the FIT Program, interested parties were to apply for a 20 or 40-year power purchase agreement (a **\"FIT Contract\")** with the OPA. Under a FIT Contract, generators would be paid a guaranteed price per kWh for electricity delivered into the Ontario electricity system. Participation in the FIT Program was open to projects located in Ontario that generated electricity exclusively from one or more sources of renewable energy. Applicants had to be connected to the electricity grid (either to a distribution system, a transmission system or through a customer).\n\n15.\n\nThe FIT Program itself was divided into two streams: the FIT stream for projects with a production capacity exceeding 10 kW and the microFIT stream for projects with a lower capacity. All of the Claimant\u2019s projects fell within the FIT stream.\n\n16.\n\nWhen launching the FIT Program, the Government was concerned that the number of applications would not be sufficient to meet Ontario\u2019s energy needs. In reality, a high number of applications were filed and the Government employed an \"independent fairness monitor\", London Economics International, LLC **(\"LEI\"),** inter alia to design a system to process the large number of applications.\n\n**C.** Applications to the **FIT** Program\n------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe FIT Rules set out a process for scoring and ranking applications to determine which projects would receive FIT Contracts. Projects with the highest rankings would be awarded contracts based on available transmission capacity.\n\n18.\n\nThe process involved two phases: a special process for ranking applications received during the first 60 days of the program **(\"the Launch Period\")** and a standard process for ranking applications received later. Applications received during the Launch Period would be ranked based on criteria identifying the most development-ready (or \"shovel-ready\") projects, whereas all other applications would be ranked based on the time when they were received by the OPA.\n\n**1. Launch Period Applications**\n---------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nApplications received between 1 October and 30 November 2009 **(\"Launch Period Applications\")** were deemed to **have** been received at the same time. Applicants during this period could advance their ranking by demonstrating that their projects were \"shovel-ready.\" in order to assess shovel-readiness, the OPA looked at four criteria: (i) whether the project was exempt from the Renewable Energy Approval **(\"REA\")** Process **(\"REA Exemption Point\");** (ii) whether the applicant owned or had a firm order for a major component **(\"Major Equipment Control Point\");** (III) whether the applicant had successfully developed a similar facility **(\"Prior Experience Point\");** and (iv) whether the applicant had financial backing **(\"Financial Capacity Point\").**\n\n20.\n\nIf an applicant satisfied all of these criteria, it would be awarded four points. For each point awarded, the applicant committed to operate its project 90 days earlier than otherwise required under the standard FIT Contract **(\"COD Acceleration Days\").** Accordingly, if an applicant bid for all four criteria points, it committed to bring its project Into commercial operation 360 days earlier than otherwise required by the FIT Contract.\n\n21.\n\nIn addition, Launch Period applicants could commit to be ready for commercial operations up to 365 days earlier than otherwise required by the FIT Contract. Thus, in total, a Launch Period applicant could bid up to a maximum of 725 COD Acceleration Days.\n\n**2. Other Applications**\n-------------------------\n\n22.\n\nApplications received after the Launch Period received a time stamp based on the actual date and time when the OPA received the application. The ranking of these applications was based solely on their time stamps; these applicants could not advance their rankings by demonstrating that their projects were shovel-ready.\n\n23.\n\nIn order to consolidate launch and post-launch period rankings, the OPA developed a procedure to translate COD Acceleration Days back Into a \"time stamp.\" As a result, the top-ranked Launch Period Application, based on the number of COD Acceleration Days that it had been awarded, would be accorded the \"earliest\" time stamp. The second ranked application would be accorded the next earliest, and so on until all the Launch Period Applications had been ranked. All other applications would then be ranked in accordance with their actual time stamp.\n\n24.\n\nAny applicant would only be offered a FIT Contract if there was sufficient transmission capacity available to connect its project to the grid. To determine if there was sufficient transmission capacity, the OPA would conduct a Transmission Availability Test **(\"TAT\").** if no capacity was available for the project, the OPA would conduct an Economic Connection Test **(\"ECT\")** to determine whether it was economically and technically feasible to upgrade the transmission system to accommodate the project.\n\n25.\n\nOther requirements had to be satisfied before a project could proceed to development. These included regulatory approvals, impact assessments, permits and licenses.8\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7114.\n\n**D.** Mesa\u2019s Applications to the **FIT** Program\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nMesa filed six applications under the FIT Program.9 On 25 November 2009, TTD and Arran submitted one application each. Each application bid for three criteria points: Major Equipment Control, Prior Experience and Financial Capacity. Subsequently, on 29 May 2010, North Bruce and Summerhill submitted two applications each. All of Mesa\u2019s projects were located in the Bruce Region of Ontario.\n\nMem. \u00a726.\n\n**E.** Awarding **FIT** Contracts\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. First Round of FIT Contract Offers**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nA vast majority of the FIT applications submitted during the Launch Period were inadequately completed. Rather than rejecting the applications on this basis, the OPA communicated with the applicants, creating an online tool that would allow them to supplement or correct the information that they had submitted. Ultimately, the OPA reviewed a total of 447 Launch Period Applications on their merits.\n\n28.\n\nOn 8 April 2010, after the TATs were run to determine whether transmission capacity was available for the relevant projects, the OPA offered a first round of 184 contracts to Launch Period Applicants. This represented a total of approximately 2,500 MW of available capacity. Due to transmission constraints, no contracts were awarded to projects located in the Bruce region, such as the Claimant\u2019s TTD and Arran projects.\n\n**2. Second Round of FIT Contract Offers**\n------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn 21 December 2010, the OPA published the priority rankings for the 242 applications that had not received a FIT Contract in April of the same year. The OPA divided the ranking into \"transmission areas\" (i.e. regions) and provided an \"area ranking.\" The Respondent explains that applicants were placed into these areas on the basis of the location of the point at which they would connect to the electricity grid (connection point), not on the basis of the geographic location of the generation facility. According to the Respondent, dividing the rankings by transmission area was important, in particular because only a certain amount of power could be put on the transmission lines coming out of any specific area. Mesa\u2019s TTD and Arran projects were ranked 8th and 9th in the Bruce Region and 91st and 96th in the province of Ontario. Subsequently, Mesa\u2019s two Summerhill applications were ranked 318th and 319th, and the two North Bruce applications were ranked 320th and 321st.\n\n30.\n\nOn 24 February 2011, after running the necessary TATs, the OPA offered 40 FIT Contracts for a total of 872 MW. Once again, because of transmission constraints, no contracts were awarded in the Bruce Region.\n\n**3. Third Round of FIT Contract Offers**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nApplications which did not receive a FIT Contract because of the lack of transmission capacity were added to a priority ranking list and were scheduled for an ECT. Before the ECT, the OPA released a new priority ranking reflecting all applications received up to and including 4 June 2010.\n\n32.\n\nAs noted above, no FIT Contracts had been awarded to projects in the Bruce region due to transmission constraints. These constraints could only be resolved by the construction of a new high-voltage transmission line out of the Bruce region (the **\"Bruce to Milton Line\").** it was estimated that this new line would result in approximately 1,200 MW of transmission capacity being made available in the Bruce region for all of Ontario\u2019s renewable energy projects. However, the development of this line was subject to regulatory approvals, which were only obtained in the summer of 2011.\n\n33.\n\nBy this time, much had changed in the Ontario electricity market. For instance, in 2010, the Government had released its Long Term Energy Plan (the **\"LTEP\")** under which it established a target of a total of 10,700 MW of renewable energy capacity in Ontario by 2018. Further, the 2011 Supply Mix Directive had directed the OPA to plan to reach this target with renewables making up 10-15% of the supply mix. The Respondent explains that, due to the success of the FIT Program, Ontario was rapidly approaching these targets and it thus became necessary to slow down the pace of its procurement of renewable energy.\n\n34.\n\nIn this context, it was not practical, so argues the Respondent, to run a province-wide ECT. The Ministry of Energy, in consultation with the OPA, thus drew up a more \"discrete\" process specific to the Bruce to Milton Line, \"[to] meet developer expectations by Including the relevant components of an ECT, without actually being a province-wide ECT\"10 (the **\"Bruce to Milton Allocation Process\").**\n\nWitness Statement of Susan Lo dated 28 February 2014 **(\"Sue Lo WS** I\") \u00a746\n\n35.\n\nThe Bruce to Milton Allocation Process was put Into effect by a direction of the Minister of Energy on 3 June 2011. The OPA was directed to award FIT Contracts for 750 MW in the Bruce Region. Further, each project was to be given an opportunity to change its connection point during a five business-day period starting on 6 June 2011 (the **\"Connection Point Amendment Window\").** This meant that projects located within the Bruce Region could select a connection point outside this region and build transmission lines from their generation facility to the connection point.\n\n36.\n\nAfter the close of the Connection Point Amendment Window, on July 6, 2011 the OPA offered 14 FIT Contracts, totalling 749.5 MW. None of the Claimant\u2019s projects received a FIT Contract.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the \"arbitrary and unfair\" design and Implementation of the FIT Program, as well as the directives of the Minister of Energy, ultimately led to it not being awarded any FIT Contracts.\n\n**F.** The Green Energy Investment Agreement\n--------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the measures taken by the Government in the wake of the financial crisis was the enactment of the GEGEA. At the same time, the Government entered Into discussions with two Korean companies, Samsung C&T Corporation **(\"Samsung\")** and Korea Electric Power Corporation (together, the **\"Korean Consortium\")** regarding a proposal for a major Investment in Ontario's renewable energy sector. These discussions culminated in the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (the **\"MOU\")** in December 2008.\n\n39.\n\nOn 21 January 2010, the Government and the Korean Consortium entered into the Green Energy Investment Agreement **(\"GEIA\").** Valued at CAD 7 billion, the GEIA was, according to Canada, the single largest investment in renewable electricity generation in the Province's history.\n\n40.\n\nThe GEIA required the Korean Consortium to establish and operate manufacturing facilities for wind and solar generation equipment in Ontario. In exchange, the Korean Consortium was *inter alia* guaranteed priority access to 2,500 MW of transmission capacity in Ontario. The capacity was to be allocated in five phases over five years, with each phase targeting approximately 500 MW.\n\n41.\n\nIn the first phase, on 30 September 2009, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to hold 240 MW of transmission capacity in Haldimand County in reserve for the Korean Consortium, and 260 MW in Essex County and the Municipality of Chatham-Kent jointly. in the second phase, on 17 September 2010, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to hold in reserve 500 MW of transmission capacity in the Bruce Region.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the GEIA granted the Korean Consortium \"significantly\" better access to Ontario\u2019s energy grid and ultimately led to the Claimant not receiving any FIT Contracts.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A.** Initial Phase\n--------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn 6 July 2011, Mesa served Canada with a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement **(\"NAFTA\").**\n\n44.\n\nOn 4 October 2011, the Claimant filed **a** Notice of Arbitration (the **\"Notice of Arbitration\"** or **\"NoA\")** accompanied by Exhibits 1 to 2 and Tabs 1 to 17. In the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant sought the following relief:\n\n\"a. Damages of not less than CDN$775 million in compensation for loss, harm, injury, moral damage, loss of reputation, and damage caused by or resulting from Canada\u2019s breach of its obligations under Part A of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA;\n\nb. Costs of these proceedings, including all professional fees and disbursements;\n\nc. Fees and expenses incurred to mitigate the effect of the unlawful governmental measures taken by Canada;\n\nd. Pre-award and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal; and\n\ne. Such further relief as counsel may advise and the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\"\n\n45.\n\nOn 3 January 2012, the Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States, as arbitrator in this case.\n\n46.\n\nOn 31 May 2012, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby T. Landau, QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator in this case.\n\n47.\n\nOn 29 June 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"),** acting as appointing authority, appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n48.\n\nEach of the members of the Tribunal subsequently signed a Declaration of Acceptance and Statement of Independence and Impartiality regarding his or her appointment. In the further course of the arbitration, on 4 May 2015, the Presiding Arbitrator disclosed that she was chairing an ICSID arbitration in which Mr. Toby Landau appeared as counsel.\n\n49.\n\nOn 16 July 2012, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that the Tribunal had been duly constituted and Invited the Respondent to submit an Answer to the Notice of Arbitration by 31 July 2012.\n\n**B.** Written Phase\n--------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 16 July 2012, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, Informing it that some evidentiary Issues may arise in the arbitration \"from a Judicial Subpoena Issued in the Northern District of California and a related Non-disclosure Court Order.\" The Claimant submitted the Non-disclosure Order, advising the Tribunal that the Order required it to be \"aware of the need to protect confidentiality of evidence obtained from the US Courts in the arbitration\", whilst also Informing the Tribunal that a \"similar type of subpoena was confirmed by the Courts of the State of Florida earlier this month.\"\n\n51.\n\nOn 30 July 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Permanent Court of Arbitration **(\"PCA\")** would act as the administering institution and that a preliminary hearing would be held on 12 October 2012 in Toronto, Canada.\n\n52.\n\nOn 31 July 2012, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of 16 July 2012, the Respondent submitted an Outline of Potential Issues.\n\n53.\n\nOn 16 August 2012, the Tribunal circulated draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules to the Parties for their comments and proposed to appoint Mr. Rahul Donde, an associate with the Presiding Arbitrator\u2019s law firm in Geneva, as Secretary of the Tribunal. On 31 August 2012, the Parties confirmed that they had no objection to Mr. Donde\u2019s appointment.\n\n54.\n\nOn 30 August 2012, the Claimant informed the Respondent that, further to a court order issued in the Northern District of California, it had received documents from Pattern Energy Group LP, on which it intended to rely in this arbitration. The Claimant further informed the Respondent that the Federal Court for the Northern District of California had issued a Protective Order with respect to the relevant documents that the Respondent would be required to accept if it wished to see the documents. The Claimant also advised that if the Respondent did not agree to those terms, the Protective Order provided for the resolution of that issue by the Tribunal. On 7 September 2012, the Respondent refused to sign the Protective Order and \"reserve[d] all [its] rights to comment on the admissibility and confidentiality of [those] materials, should the Claimant seek to introduce them in this arbitration.\"\n\n55.\n\nOn 10 September 2012, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal their comments on the draft Terms of Appointment and Procedural Rules. In addition, the Respondent submitted a draft Confidentiality Order.\n\n56.\n\nIn its comments of 10 September 2012, Canada proposed that the Tribunal select either Toronto or Calgary as the legal seat of the arbitration. On 14 September 2012, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to respond to such comments by 21 September 2012. On 21 September 2012, the Claimant proposed that the Tribunal select either New York or Washington D.C. as the legal seat of the arbitration.\n\n57.\n\nIn its communication of 21 September 2012, the Claimant referred to proceedings which it had initiated in the United States pursuant to 28 USC \u00a7 1782 (Assistance to foreign and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals) **(\"Section 1782\"),** and informed the Tribunal that it Intended to offer as evidence \"documents demonstrating Canada\u2019s breaches pursuant to court proceedings in the United States.\" it also requested the Tribunal to order Canada to \"maintain and adhere to the confidentiality agreements that are annexed to the US court orders.\" The Claimant submitted to the Tribunal orders from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida requiring the Claimant \"to seek agreement from Canada to maintain disclosed documents confidential\" and proposed certain modifications to the Respondent\u2019s draft Confidentiality Order. On 28 September 2012, the Tribunal Invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant\u2019s communication of 21 September 2012.\n\n58.\n\nOn 5 October 2012, the Respondent rejected the Claimant\u2019s suggested modifications to the draft Confidentiality Order and submitted that it \"should not be ordered to adhere to the Protective Orders entered by the US district courts.\"\n\n59.\n\nOn 12 October 2012, the Tribunal held a first procedural hearing in Toronto. The hearing was attended by Mr. Barry Appleton, Dr. Alan Alexandroff, and Ms. Kyle Dickson-Smith for the Claimant, and Ms. Sylvie Tabet, Mr. Shane Spelliscy, Mr. Michael Owen, Mr. Ian Philp, Ms. Heather Squires, and Ms. Jennifer Hopkins for the Respondent. During the hearing both Parties made submissions in particular with regard to the legal seat of the arbitration. The Claimant submitted that it may be necessary to subpoena witnesses and to seek the assistance of local courts to secure documents in the hands of third parties in the US, and therefore the Tribunal should select a US seat. By contrast, the Respondent argued in favor of a seat in Canada.\n\n60.\n\nOn 16 October 2012, the Tribunal directed the Parties to make further submissions with regard to the legal seat of the arbitration by 26 October 2012, with the option of filing responses by 2 November 2012. The Parties filed submissions on the legal seat of the arbitration on 26 October 2012 and on 2 November 2012.\n\n61.\n\nOn 1 November 2012, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal \"provide a supporting letter that can be filed before the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, confirming the Tribunal\u2019s ability to use the documents received under the Section 1782 process.\" On the same day, the Tribunal confirmed that it had the authority to rule on the admission and use in the arbitration of documents that the Claimant had obtained pursuant to the order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Tribunal also invited the Claimant \"to apply to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to confirm that... [the] Tribunal [had] the authority to govern the use of the...documents\" obtained pursuant to the order of that court. The Tribunal also circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 **(\"PO 1\")** and a revised draft of the Confidentiality Order for the Parties\u2019 comments.\n\n62.\n\nOn 9 November 2012, the Respondent provided its comments on the draft PO 1 and the draft Confidentiality Order. It also presented three requests seeking (i) confirmation that the Tribunal had not ruled on the Respondent\u2019s objection raised on 5 October 2012; (ii) if the Section 1782 documents were admissible, confirmation that the determination would not apply to any transcripts of witness testimony; and (iii) confirmation that further efforts by the Claimant to obtain evidence using Section 1782 should be pursued only under the supervision of the Tribunal.\n\n63.\n\nOn 13 November 2012, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments on such requests, which Mesa did on 19 November 2012.\n\n64.\n\nOn 21 November 2012, the Tribunal issued the final version of PO 1, which, *inter alia,* confirmed the composition of the Tribunal, the appointment of Mr. Rahul Donde as Secretary of the Tribunal, and the appointment of the PCA as administering institution. Annex B to PO 1 established the procedural calendar for the further proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal also issued the final version of the Confidentiality Order. The Order allowed the Parties to designate information in written submissions as \"Confidential\" or \"Restricted Access\", in which case they would be required to file a \"Confidential\" or \"Restricted Access\" version of the relevant submissions within certain deadlines. The Order further specified that, if a Party did not agree with the other\u2019s designation of information as \"Confidential\" or \"Restricted Access\", it could submit the issue for resolution to the Tribunal.\n\n66.\n\nOn 22 November 2012, responding to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of 1 November 2012, the Claimant submitted to the Tribunal a draft letter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n\n67.\n\nOn 26 November 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had received an order from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granting its Section 1782 application to obtain certain documents and information from Samsung C&T America, Inc. and that it would bring the Tribunal\u2019s Confidentiality Order to the attention of the New Jersey District Court.\n\n68.\n\nOn 27 November 2012, the Respondent reiterated its requests of 9 November 2012 and also informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the content of the draft letter to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida proposed by the Claimant.\n\n69.\n\nOn the same day, the Parties sent the Tribunal a copy of the Confidentiality Order signed by the Parties.\n\n70.\n\nOn 3 December 2012, in accordance with the procedural calendar set forth in Annex B to PO 1, the Respondent submitted a Request for Bifurcation accompanied by legal authorities (RL-1 to RL-14) and an Objection to Jurisdiction accompanied by Exhibits R-1 to R-20 and legal authorities (RL-15 to RL-38).\n\n71.\n\nOn 24 December 2012, the Claimant submitted a Response on Bifurcation.\n\n72.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 2 **(\"PO 2\"),** containing its decision to bifurcate the proceedings Into two phases, concerning \"(I) the jurisdictional objection based on the alleged failure of the Claimant to comply with Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA, and (ii) the merits of the case and any and all other jurisdictional objections that may arise.\" The Tribunal reserved its power to re-join the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection to the merits of the case following review of the Parties\u2019 further submissions.\n\n73.\n\nOn 19 February 2013, the Claimant submitted an Answer to Canada\u2019s Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction **(\"Answer on Jurisdiction\").**\n\n74.\n\nOn 23 February 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had received an Amended Protective Order from the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in respect of documents produced by NextEra Energy Resources, LLC in response to the Claimant\u2019s Section 1782 application before that court, and sought leave to file additional documents supporting the arguments set out in its Answer on Jurisdiction.\n\n75.\n\nOn 26 February 2013, the Respondent reiterated its previous requests with regard to its challenges to the admissibility of documents that Mesa had obtained under Section 1782, and also requested the Tribunal to direct the Claimant to identify any Section 1782 documents already in the record and to strike those documents from the record.\n\n76.\n\nStill on 26 February 2013, the Claimant filed a public version of its Answer on Jurisdiction. On 27 February 2013, Canada objected that the Claimant\u2019s designation of information as \"Confidential\" in its Answer on Jurisdiction failed to comply with the provisions of the Tribunal\u2019s Confidentiality Order. On the same day, the Claimant submitted a new version of its Answer on Jurisdiction seeking to address the issues raised by the Respondent.\n\n77.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent\u2019s requests regarding Section 1782 documents.\n\n78.\n\nOn 28 February 2013, a telephone conference took place, during which the Tribunal heard the Parties\u2019 views on the continuation of the bifurcation.\n\n79.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimant submitted a copy of the order issued by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in respect of documents produced by Samsung C&T America, Inc. In response to the Claimant\u2019s Section 1782 application before that court.\n\n80.\n\nOn 28 March 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 **(\"PO 3\")** in which it dismissed the Respondent\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of all Section 1782 documents and selected Miami, Florida, as the legal seat of the arbitration. It chose Miami over other alternatives proposed by the Parties because of the possibility to issue subpoenas and seek the assistance of the courts in procuring evidence of third parties located in the US. This was on the basis that that Claimant had represented that key evidence was located within the State of Florida and wanted the option to call upon the Tribunal and local courts to exercise powers to secure the same. Finally, having had the benefit of the Claimant\u2019s Answer on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that it would not be possible to rule on the application of Article 1120(1) in the abstract without substantially engaging in the facts of the dispute. It thus discontinued the bifurcation ordered in PO 2, and set forth an amended procedural calendar.\n\n81.\n\nOn 17 April 2013, the Parties exchanged their requests for document production.\n\n82.\n\nOn 23 April 2013, Mesa informed the Tribunal that the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey had granted part of its Section 1782 application seeking documents from the Korea Electric Power Corporation.\n\n83.\n\nOn 21 May 2013, the Parties exchanged their reasoned objections to each other\u2019s document production requests.\n\n84.\n\nOn 10 June 2013, the Claimant submitted a Request for Particulars, asking the Tribunal to direct the Respondent to provide \"factual particulars\" (along with documents, communications and files) relating to the Respondent\u2019s submissions on jurisdiction and on the merits. On the same day, Canada requested that the Tribunal grant it until 19 June 2013 to respond, which the Tribunal did on 13 June 2013.\n\n85.\n\nOn 11 June 2013, each of the Parties submitted a Redfern Schedule containing its document production requests, the other side\u2019s objections, and its replies.\n\n86.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent submitted two further requests. One concerned the Claimant\u2019s designation of certain Information as \"Restricted Access\" or \"Confidential.\" The other sought a modification of PO 1 to allow it to produce documents to the Claimant only in electronic format. On 13 June 2013, the Tribunal Invited the Claimant to comment on these requests by 19 June 2013.\n\n87.\n\nOn 19 June 2013, Canada submitted its comments on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Particulars, arguing that it should be rejected. On the same day, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent\u2019s requests in connection with the designation of Information and electronic production.\n\n88.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, the Tribunal, on the Claimant\u2019s request and with the Respondent\u2019s consent, modified the schedule for the subsequent pleadings of the Parties.\n\n89.\n\nOn 12 July 2013, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 4 **(\"PO 4\"),** denying Mesa\u2019s Request for Particulars; deciding the Parties\u2019 document production requests; denying the Respondent\u2019s request to produce documents to the Claimant only electronically; and deciding the Respondent\u2019s request concerning the Claimant\u2019s designation of certain Information.\n\n90.\n\nOn 2 August 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension of the time limit for the production of documents with respect to \"IESO\", Hydro One and the OPA set by PO 4. On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimant\u2019s comments on the Respondent\u2019s request. The Claimant provided its comments on 6 August 2013, objecting to the Respondent\u2019s request, but agreeing to a 30-day extension for the Respondent\u2019s document production. Additionally, the Claimant submitted two requests of its own, asking the Tribunal (i) to order that the Respondent disclose \"all of its correspondence with the [OPA], Hydro One, and the IESO, relating to document disclosure and production, and correspondence with Ontario on the same issue\", and (ii) to \"draw an adverse inference against [the Respondent] from any non-production of relevant documents.\" On 7 August 2013, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would soon issue a ruling and suspended the document production time limit until then.\n\n91.\n\nOn 23 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 **(\"PO 5\"),** granting the Respondent\u2019s request for an extension of the time limit with regard to document production and denying the Claimant\u2019s requests.\n\n92.\n\nOn 28 August 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to request leave to proceed with its Section 1782 applications before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida and the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\n93.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal asked the Claimant for the court applications which it intended to file in the Section 1782 proceedings. On 2 November 2013, the Claimant submitted that the Tribunal should order that the applications be treated as \"Restricted Access\" information and that Canada undertake not to communicate with any nondisputing party regarding \"any issues related to the completed applications\" until after they had been filed. In its response of 8 November 2013, the Respondent objected to this submission.\n\n94.\n\nOn 20 November 2013, the Claimant submitted its Memorial accompanied by Exhibits C-1 to C-421, legal authorities (Exhibits CL-1 to CL-202), one witness statement and one expert report.\n\n95.\n\nOn 25 November 2013, the Respondent submitted that the designation of certain information by the Claimant in its Memorial as \"Restricted Access\" was inappropriate. It requested, *inter alia,* that the Tribunal order the Claimant to correct all the inappropriate designations in the Memorial and to provide a brief justification for those designations that it wished to maintain.\n\n96.\n\nOn 4 December 2013, the Tribunal denied the Claimant\u2019s request of 2 November 2013 to designate the Claimant\u2019s Section 1782 applications as \"Restricted Access\" Information.\n\n97.\n\nOn 9 December 2013, Canada requested the Tribunal to (I) strike certain portions of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial and certain supporting documents on the basis that \"they refer to and rely upon witness testimony obtained and submitted by the Claimant contrary to the established procedures in this arbitration and to Canada\u2019s due process rights\"; (ii) \"strike Part V, Jurisdiction, of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial as it contains new and unauthorized submissions by the Claimant relating to Canada\u2019s jurisdictional objection regarding the Claimant\u2019s failure to respect the \u2018cooling-off\u2019 period under NAFTA\"; (III) order the production of certain documents responsive to the Respondent\u2019s original document production requests of 17 April 2013; and (lv) order the Claimant to provide the Respondent with the Excel model used by the Claimant\u2019s damages experts.\n\n98.\n\nOn 10 December 2013, the Claimant submitted its Section 1782 applications.\n\n99.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the Claimant submitted a response to the Respondent\u2019s requests of 9 December 2013.\n\n100.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, deciding the Issues raised in the Respondent\u2019s 25 November 2013 submission and providing certain directions with regard to future designations of the Parties.\n\n101.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Respondent commented on the Claimant\u2019s Section 1782 applications, and requested the Tribunal to (I) \"[r]efuse to authorize the Claimant to proceed with further evidence gathering in the United States from Nextera and Samsung\"; (ii) make certain determinations in relation to designations; and (III) grant the Respondent an extension of the time limit for its Counter-Memorial. The Respondent also objected to some of the Claimant\u2019s designations in its Memorial.\n\n102.\n\nOn 23 December 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal in relation to its \"Confidential\" and \"Restricted Access\" designations.\n\n103.\n\nOn 24 December 2013, Mesa requested the Tribunal to strike certain confidentiality designations by the Respondent and to direct the latter to produce certain documents which it had withheld for lack of consent from third parties.\n\n104.\n\nOn 30 December 2013, the Tribunal conveyed its decisions on a number of outstanding requests made by the Parties and advised the Parties that the reasons for its decisions would follow. Specifically, the Tribunal (I) denied the Respondent\u2019s request to strike portions of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial; (ii) denied the Respondent\u2019s request to strike arguments relating to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial; (III) ordered the Claimant to produce certain documents requested by the Respondent, whilst denying other document production requests; (lv) directed the Claimant to produce the Excel model used by the Claimant\u2019s damages experts; and (v) denied the Claimant\u2019s request to approve its proposed Section 1782 applications in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, noting that the Claimant \"[might] revive its request at a later stage.\"\n\n105.\n\nOn 3 January 2014, Canada wrote to the Tribunal, (I) making certain requests with regard to confidentiality designations; (ii) requesting the Tribunal to deny the Claimant\u2019s requests regarding the production of certain documents by the Respondent made in the Claimant\u2019s letter of 24 December 2013; and (III) requesting the Tribunal to order the Claimant to submit Into the record the entire transcript of the deposition of Mr. Colin Edwards, which evidence the Claimant had obtained through its Section 1782 applications.\n\n106.\n\nOn 8 January 2014, Mesa \"declassified\" 60% of the designations challenged on 20 December 2013, but maintained its position on the remaining designations.\n\n107.\n\nOn 15 January 2014, the Claimant responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 3 January 2014 and specified its requested relief with regard to the Issues raised in that letter.\n\n108.\n\nOn 16 January 2014, the Respondent objected to the Claimant\u2019s submission of 15 January 2014 as being unauthorized and requested the Tribunal to strike it from the record.\n\n109.\n\nOn 20 January 2014, the Respondent commented on the Claimant\u2019s letter of 8 January 2014 and challenged the Claimant\u2019s confidentiality designations with regard to evidence derived from the Section 1782 applications.\n\n110.\n\nOn 24 January 2014, the Respondent provided comments on the Claimant\u2019s letter of 15 January 2014.\n\n111.\n\nOn the dame day, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s challenges of 20 January 2014.\n\n112.\n\nOn 18 February 2014, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, requesting it to order the Respondent to produce certain documents and to demonstrate claims of privilege on a document-by-document basis.\n\n113.\n\nOn 27 February 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to suspend paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Confidentiality Order in respect of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial and supporting documents pending the resolution by the Tribunal of the outstanding disputes between the Parties in relation to designations. On the same day, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request. The Tribunal granted the suspension sought \"for the time being\", whilst inviting the Claimant to provide its comments by 6 March 2014.\n\n114.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial and Reply on Jurisdiction **(\"Counter-Memorial\")** accompanied by Exhibits R-21 to R-173, legal authorities (RL-39 to RL-76), six witness statements and two expert reports.\n\n115.\n\nOn 3 March 2014, the Claimant commented on the Respondent\u2019s request of 27 February 2014.\n\n116.\n\nOn 5 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 **(\"PO 6\"),** providing reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decision of 30 December 2013.

On 23 June 2014, the Respondent submitted its views on the Claimant\u2019s response.\n\n146.\n\nOn 24 June 2014, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 10 **(\"PO 10\")** by which it decided the Respondent\u2019s challenges in connection with the designation of certain Information in the Claimant\u2019s Reply and its supporting documents.\n\n147.\n\nOn 2 July 2014, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits (the **\"Rejoinder\").** The Rejoinder was accompanied by Exhibits R-174 to R-196, legal authorities (RL-77 to RL-113), five witness statements and one expert report.\n\n148.\n\nOn 4 July 2014, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 11 **(\"PO 11\")** in which it ruled on Mesa\u2019s challenges to additional confidentiality designations proposed by the Respondent with regard to the Reply Memorial and directed the Claimant to produce a re-designated Reply Memorial and supporting documents by 11 July 2014, as well as a public version of these documents by 18 July 2014.\n\n149.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, the Claimant submitted a re-designated public version as well as an amended \"Restricted Access\" and \"Confidential\" version of its Reply Memorial.\n\n150.\n\nOn 22 July 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to determine that the Information contained in certain exhibits provided by the Claimant was public.\n\n151.\n\nOn 23 July 2014, the Claimant submitted a Request to Produce Documents to the Respondent pursuant to the possibility contemplated in PO 7.\n\n152.\n\nOn 26 July 2014, the United States and Mexico each filed their Article 1128 Submissions.\n\n153.\n\nOn 28 July 2014, the Claimant designated certain additional Information in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder and supporting documents as \"Confidential.\"\n\n154.\n\nOn 29 July 2014, Mesa advised the Tribunal that there was no further Information to provide with respect to the Section 1782 proceedings.\n\n155.\n\nOn 30 July 2014, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request of 22 July 2014 in respect of public access to information contained in certain exhibits provided by the Claimant.\n\n156.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, the Respondent provided an update about the production of documents in the possession of IESO, the OPA and Hydro One. It noted that IESO and the OPA had received consent from NextEra to the disclosure of certain information in the arbitration. Since NextEra\u2019s consent was conditional on the designation of the relevant documents as \"Restricted Access\", the Respondent requested the express agreement of the Tribunal and the Claimant to such designation.\n\n157.\n\nOn 2 August 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension of the time limit to produce documents pursuant to PO 4.\n\n158.\n\nOn 5 August 2014, the Claimant consented to the Respondent\u2019s request of 1 August 2014 to designate certain documents as \"Restricted Access.\" On 6 August 2014, the Tribunal also consented to the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n159.\n\nOn the same day, Canada objected to all the document production requests submitted by the Claimant on 23 July 2014.\n\n160.\n\nOn 7 August 2014, the Respondent challenged designations made on 28 July 2014 by the Claimant regarding the Rejoinder and supporting documents. On 12 August 2014, the Claimant replied to such challenges.\n\n161.\n\nOn the same day, Mesa submitted a \"Motion to Strike.\" it pointed out that in its Rejoinder, the Respondent had raised a new argument that if the Tribunal accepted the Claimant's position that the FIT Program was a form of government assistance, then the Program would constitute a subsidy, with the result that Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) would preclude the application of Articles 1102, 1103 and 1106 of the NAFTA (the **\"Subsidy Defense\").** The Claimant requested the Tribunal (i) to strike the Respondent\u2019s Subsidy Defense because it was raised late or (ii) in the alternative, to grant the Claimant the right to a sur-reply and additional information requests.\n\n162.\n\nOn 18 August 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 **(\"PO 12\"),** ruling on the Respondent\u2019s challenges to designations proposed by the Claimant in relation to the Rejoinder and supporting documents.

It requested that the exhibits accompanying the Claimant\u2019s submission be struck from the record and that the time for the Respondent to designate Information in these exhibits as \"Confidential\" or to object to the Claimant\u2019s confidentiality designations be suspended until the Tribunal ruled on its request.\n\n169.\n\nOn 4 September 2014, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 13 **(\"PO 13\")** on Mesa\u2019s document production requests. The Tribunal confirmed that, in accordance with PO 7, the Respondent should produce all the relevant documents on or before 17 September 2014.\n\n170.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal denied Mesa\u2019s Motion to Strike and set out a procedure for the Parties to address the Respondent\u2019s Subsidy Defense.\n\n171.\n\nOn 5 September 2014, Mesa objected to the procedure on the Subsidy Defense and requested certain clarifications from the Tribunal. On 8 September 2014, the Tribunal replied with regard to these clarifications and authorized the Parties to further comment on the procedure to deal with the Subsidy Defense. By communications dated 11 and 15 September, respectively, the Claimant and the Respondent offered such further comments.\n\n172.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, a pre-hearing conference call took place between the Parties and the Presiding Arbitrator to discuss outstanding procedural and organizational matters for the forthcoming hearing.

On 1 October 2014, the Claimant filed supplemental Exhibits C-693 to C-714. On the same day, the Respondent filed additional Exhibits R-197 to R-206 and designated certain \"Confidential\" and \"Restricted Access\" information.\n\n175.\n\nOn 3 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 **(\"PO 14\")** dealing with organizational and procedural matters with regard to the hearing. PO 14 also gave the Respondent an opportunity to address the exhibits filed by the Claimant together with its comments on the Article 1128 Submissions.\n\n176.\n\nOn 6 October 2014, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to clarify the procedures for designating \"Confidential\" and \"Restricted Access\" information contained in the exhibits submitted by the Parties on 1 October 2014 and in exhibits that Mesa had submitted with its responses to the Article 1128 Submissions of the United States and Mexico.\n\n177.\n\nOn the same day, Canada submitted its response to the arguments raised by the Claimant in its Observations on Canada\u2019s Subsidy Defense.\n\n178.\n\nOn 10 October 2014, the Respondent submitted designations with regard to the Claimant\u2019s additional exhibits filed on 1 October 2014 and the exhibits attached to the Claimant\u2019s Response to the Article 1128 Submissions.\n\n179.\n\nIn letters to the Parties of 9 and 14 October 2014, the Tribunal established timelines with regard to the challenges to the Parties\u2019 designations relating to the exhibits filed by the Claimant on 1 October 2014 and the exhibits attached to the Claimant\u2019s Response to the Article 1128 Submissions. Also on 14 October 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the United States and Mexico had expressed an Intention to attend the forthcoming hearing and requested the Parties\u2019 views in this regard.\n\n180.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 15 **(\"PO 15\")** in which it determined the Parties\u2019 challenges regarding designations in the exhibits filed by the Claimant on 1 October 2014 and the exhibits attached to the Claimant\u2019s comments on the Article 1128 Submissions.\n\n**C.** Hearing on Merits, Liability and Quantum and Subsequent Submissions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nFrom 26 October to 31 October 2014, a hearing on merits, liability and quantum was held at the Arbitration Place in Toronto.

Government of Canada* had been released. The Claimant enclosed a copy of the award and dissenting opinion and requested that it be admitted as a supplemental authority. On 15 April 2015, Canada opposed such request and, in the event that the award were to be accepted Into the record stated that \"under Article 1128, the United States and Mexico must also be afforded the opportunity to offer any comments they have on the Interpretation of NAFTA contained in the Bilcon award.\" On 16 April 2015, Mesa commented and requested that Canada\u2019s request not to admit the *Bilcon* award be denied.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** Summary of the Claimant\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nAs mentioned above, the dispute arises out of the alleged arbitrary and unfair application of various government measures related to the regulation and production of renewable energy in Ontario.11 According to the Claimant, the \"manipulation\" of the FIT Program prevented it from obtaining FIT Contracts, and caused loss and damage to Mesa and its related business operations.\n\nNoA \u00a76.\n\n208.\n\nIn essence, the Claimant contends that Ontario and thereby Canada:\n\ni. In violation of Article 1106 of the NAFTA, Imposed minimum domestic content requirements on the Claimant;\n\nii. In violation of Articles 1102 and 1103 of the NAFTA, treated the Claimant and its Investments less favourably than other Investors in like circumstances;\n\niii. In violation of Article 1104 of the NAFTA, failed to provide to the Claimant and/or its Investments the better treatment required under Articles 1102 and 1103; and,\n\niv. In violation of Article 1105 of the NAFTA, failed to treat the Claimant's Investments in accordance with the International law standard of treatment.\n\n209.\n\nWhile the Claimant Initially made claims in respect of Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA, these claims were later withdrawn.12\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7870-871 (\"in its Memorial the Investor pleaded that Canada was responsible for the acts of the Ontario Power Authority, IESO, and Hydro One under Article 1503(2), concerning state enterprises. The Investor no longer maintains these claims under NAFTA Article 1503(2). Instead it maintains its claims on the same measures under Chapter Eleven.\").\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s detailed arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to resolve the issues in dispute are summarized prior to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of each disputed issue below. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while it has reproduced only the most relevant allegations and arguments for its decision, it has considered all of the Claimant\u2019s submissions and evidence.\n\n**B.** The Claimant\u2019s Request for Relief\n----------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief, the Claimant sought the following relief:\n\n\"in view of the facts and law set out in the written submissions and during the oral hearing, the Investor respectfully requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\ni. To dismiss Canada\u2019s admissibility and jurisdictional objections in their entirety;\n\nii. A Declaration that Canada has acted in a breached [sic] its obligations under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105 and 1106;\n\niii. An award of damages for the losses that were caused by those breaches of the NAFTA, for moral damages and for pre and postaward interest compounded at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal; and\n\niv. An award in favour of the Investor for its costs, disbursements and expenses incurred in the arbitration for legal representation and assistance, plus interest, and for the costs of the Tribunal.\"13\n\nC-PHB \u00a7530.\n\n212.\n\nThis request for relief was substantially similar to the Claimant\u2019s earlier requests for relief.14\n\nMem. \u00a7962; Reply \u00a7917\n\n**C.** Summary of the Respondent\u2019s Position\n-------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent first submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute because the Claimant failed to comply with the mandatory pre-requisites for the submission of a dispute to arbitration under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA. Even if the Tribunal disagreed on this point, the Respondent contends that it would still lack jurisdiction over the claims arising out of measures in existence prior to the Claimant\u2019s investment in Canada. It would also lack jurisdiction over claims relating to the impugned acts of state enterprises like the OPA.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent next submits that even if the Tribunal found that it has jurisdiction over the present dispute; the Claimant has failed to establish that Canada has breached its NAFTA obligations. According to the Respondent, the FIT Program constitutes \"government procurement\" under Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b). Consequently, Canada has no obligations under Articles 1102, 1103 or 1106 of the NAFTA. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find that the FIT Program did not constitute procurement, the claims would fall as Mesa has \"fundamentally misconstrued\" these provisions.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent also denies that it has violated any of its obligations under Article 1105. it submits that the Claimant\u2019s applications to the FIT Program were fairly and reasonably assessed. Further, the FIT Program was adapted over the years to meet changing market conditions and policy objectives, and \"there is nothing manifestly arbitrary, unfair or unjust\" about this. In respect of the GEIA, the Respondent submits that \"[t]here is nothing manifestly arbitrary, grossly unjust, egregious or shocking about a government entering Into an Investment agreement in which it accords certain advantages to a particular Investor in exchange for certain Investment commitments by that Investor.\"15\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7406.\n\n216.\n\nin the event that the Tribunal were to find that Canada has breached the NAFTA, the Respondent contends that the damages claimed are significantly Inflated. Most of the alleged losses claimed by Mesa were not caused by the Respondent, but by the Claimant\u2019s own business failures.\n\n217.\n\nCanada\u2019s detailed arguments in so far as they are relevant and necessary to resolve the Issues in dispute are summarised below prior to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of each disputed Issue. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal emphasizes that, while it has only referred to the most Important submissions for its decision, it has considered all of the Respondent\u2019s submissions and evidence.\n\n**D.** The Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief\n------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\n\"Canada respectfully requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety and with prejudice, order that the Claimant bear the costs of this arbitration, including Canada\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance, and grant any further relief it deems just and proper.\"16\n\nRej. \u00a7277.\n\n219.\n\nThis request for relief was substantially similar to the Respondent\u2019s earlier request for relief.17\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7512.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n**A.** Preliminary Matters\n--------------------------\n\n220.\n\nPrior to addressing the merits of the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal will address certain preliminary matters: the relevance of previous decisions or awards (1); the applicable legal framework (2); and the burden of proof (3).\n\n**1. Relevance of Previous Decisions and Awards**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nIn support of their positions, both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another tribunal.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other arbitral tribunals. At the same time however, the Tribunal does believe that it should pay due respect to such decisions. Unless there are reasons to the contrary, the Tribunal will adopt the approaches established in a series of consistent cases comparable to the case at hand, subject, of course, to the specifics of the NAFTA and to the circumstances of the actual case. By doing so, the Tribunal believes it will meet its duty to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.\n\n**2. Applicable Legal Framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n**a. Law Governing the Procedure**\n----------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nArticle 1120(2) of the NAFTA and paragraph 8 of PO 1 deal with the applicable procedural framework in the following terms:\n\n\"[T]he applicable arbitration rules shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Section\" (Art. 1120(2)).\n\n\"8.1 The procedure in this arbitration shall be governed by the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules except as modified by the provisions of Section B of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA (per Article 1120(2) of the NAFTA).\n\n8.2 if these provisions and rules do not address a specific procedural Issue, the Tribunal shall, after consultation with the Parties, determine the applicable procedure. In addition, the Tribunal may seek guidance from, but shall not be bound by, the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration\" (Paragraph 8 PO 1).\n\n224.\n\nThe applicable procedural rules are thus the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules **(\"UNCITRAL Rules\"****),** except to the extent that they are modified by the provisions of Section B of NAFTA Chapter 11.\n\n225.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal recalls that the legal seat of the arbitration is Miami, Florida, which may trigger the application of certain mandatory rules of International arbitration law applicable at the seat.\n\n**b. Law Governing Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe jurisdiction of this Tribunal must primarily be governed by the NAFTA as this is the Instrument by which Canada has expressed its offer to arbitrate, which the Claimant has accepted, thereby achieving consent.\n\n227.\n\nChapter 11 contains a choice of law which is quoted below and according to which the Issues in dispute must be resolved in accordance with the NAFTA and \"applicable rules of International law.\"\n\n**c. Law Governing the Merits**\n-------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nArticle 33(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that an arbitral tribunal must \"apply the law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute.\"\n\n229.\n\nArticle 1131 of the NAFTA contains a choice of law clause as follows, which is also reproduced in paragraph 7.1 of PO 1:\n\n\"Article 1131: Governing Law\n\n1. A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\n\n2. An interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.\"\n\n230.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will resolve the merits of this dispute by application of the NAFTA and relevant rules of international law. As will be further discussed in the context of Article 1105, the Tribunal will also follow interpretations issued by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission (the **\"FTC\"),** specifically the 31 July 2001 \"Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter Eleven Provisions\" (the **\"FTC Note\").**\n\n**d. Principles of Interpretation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nArticle 102 of the NAFTA sets out the objectives of the treaty and provides that the latter must be interpreted with these objectives in mind:\n\n\"Article 102: Objectives\n\n1. The objectives of this Agreement, as elaborated more specifically through its principles and rules, including national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment and transparency, are to:\n\na) eliminate barriers to trade in, and facilitate the cross-border movement of, goods and services between the territories of the Parties;\n\nb) promote conditions of fair competition in the free trade area;\n\nc) increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties;\n\nd) provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in each Party\u2019s territory;\n\ne) create effective procedures for the implementation and application of this Agreement, for its joint administration and for the resolution of disputes; and\n\nf) establish a framework for further trilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation to expand and enhance the benefits of this Agreement.\n\n2. The Parties shall interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with applicable rules of International law.\"\n\n232.\n\nAmong the \"applicable rules of International law\" referred to in paragraph 2 of the provision just quoted, one counts Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the **\"VCLT\"** or **\"Vienna Convention\"),18** which codify customary International law in the following terms:\n\n\"Article 31. General Rule of Interpretation\n\n1. A treaty shall be Interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the Interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, Including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) Any Instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an Instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken Into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the Interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its Interpretation;\n\n(c) Any relevant rules of International law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so Intended.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Article 32. Supplementary Means of Interpretation\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of Interpretation, Including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the Interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"\n\nExh. CL-11.\n\n233.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal will interpret the provisions of the NAFTA in accordance with the rules on treaty interpretation of the VCLT, taking into account the objectives of the NAFTA as they are set forth in Article 102(1).\n\n**3. Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n234.\n\nBoth Parties have made submissions on the allocation of the burden of proof in respect of jurisdiction and merits. Mesa submits that the Respondent bears the burden of proof for the jurisdictional defenses it raises.19 On its part, the Respondent submits that the Claimant bears the burden of establishing that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute. It also points out that where there is any ambiguity about whether it has jurisdiction or not, a tribunal should decline to act.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7806-808.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules contains the rules applicable with respect to which Party bears the burden of proof. It provides:\n\n\"Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\"\n\n236.\n\nThus, each Party must establish the facts on which it relies in support of its claims and defenses. It is for the Claimant to establish the factual elements necessary to sustain the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the challenged measures.20 The Claimant appears to agree with this position.21\n\nExh.

United States* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 14 June 2013 (\"Apotex\"), \u00a7150.\n\nReply \u00a7804 (\"[Mesa] must demonstrate that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear its claims\"); \u00a7805 (\"The Investor bears the burden to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under NAFTA Chapter 11\").\n\n237.\n\nOn the merits, the Claimant must establish the facts showing that the challenged measures are contrary to the substantive protections of the NAFTA - a position which the Claimant accepts.22 For instance, it is for the Claimant to demonstrate the facts that constitute a breach of Article 1105(1).23 Similarly, where the Respondent raises a defense - for instance, that the FIT Program involves procurement under Article 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) - it must establish the facts necessary to sustain the defense.24\n\nReply \u00a7804 (\"Mesa must prove its allegations that Canada breached its Article 1102, 1103, 1105 and 1106 NAFTA obligations [...]\").\n\nExh.

United States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/1), Award, 9 January 2003 (\"ADF\"), \u00a7185: (\"The Investor, of course, in the end has the burden of sustaining its charge of inconsistency with Article 1105(1). That burden has not been discharged here and hence, as a strict technical matter, the Respondent does not have to prove that the current customary international law concerning standards of treatment consists only of discrete, specific rules applicable to limited contexts.\"); See also, RL-073, *United Parcel Service of America, Inc. v.

Republic of Ecuador* (UNCITRAL), Interim Award, 1 December 2008, \u00a7138 (\"As a general rule, the holder of a right raising a claim on the basis of that right in legal proceedings bears the burden of proof for all elements required for the claim. However, an exception to this rule occurs when a respondent raises a defense to the effect that the claim is precluded despite the normal conditions being met. In that case, the respondent must assume the burden of proof for the elements necessary for the exception to be allowed.\").\n\n**B.** Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n-------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant has initiated the present arbitration under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA and alleges breaches of the substantive guarantees contained in that Chapter. It cites Articles 1116, 1120 and 1122 of the NAFTA as bases for this arbitration.25\n\nNoA \u00a74. See also PO 1 \u00a75.1;Tr.(31 October 2014) 91:8-10 (\"There is another provision in NAFTA, Article 1117. But it is not in issue in this case. *We brought this under Article 1116.* (emphasis supplied)\").\n\n239.\n\nOn its part, the Respondent has raised a number of preliminary objections. First, it contends that this Tribunal is without jurisdiction over the present dispute (or, at least part of the dispute), as the Claimant has failed to comply with the three-month \"cooling off\" period specified in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA ((2) below). Second and in the alternative, it contends that even if the necessary conditions have been fulfilled, the Claimant has raised numerous arguments which are beyond the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Specifically, according to the Respondent, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over alleged breaches that occurred before the Claimant made its investments in Ontario ((3) below). Third, the Respondent objects that the acts of the OPA are not attributable to it ((4) below). Finally, relying on Article 1116, it argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider any alleged breaches which could not have caused loss to the Claimant (an objection discussed in the context of the first jurisdictional defense in connection with Article 1120(1) in section (2) below).\n\n240.\n\nBefore entering into the merits of the Respondent\u2019s objections, the Tribunal will first examine the Claimant\u2019s compliance with the requirements for the submission of a claim to arbitration ((1) below).\n\n**1. Requirements for Submission of a Claim to Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nSection B of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA contains various requirements for the submission of a claim to arbitration under the provisions of that Chapter. The Claimant recognises that (at least some of) these requirements must be fulfilled.26 The Tribunal now turns to review the Claimant\u2019s satisfaction of these requirements.\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7838-855.\n\n**a. Article 1121**\n-------------------\n\n242.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Claimant has submitted its claims to arbitration under Article 1116. The conditions to submit a claim to arbitration under Article 1116 are provided in Article 1121, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Article 1121: Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1. A disputing Investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if:\n\n(a) the Investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and\n\n(b) the Investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an Interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the Investor owns or controls directly or Indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to Initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for Injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not Involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.\"\n\n243.\n\nThus, Article 1121 requires a \"disputing Investor\"27 to consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the NAFTA. Further, the disputing Investor must waive its right to Initiate or continue other proceedings concerning the measures that are the subject of the Chapter 11 arbitration.\n\nArticle 1139 of the NAFTA defines \"disputing investor\" as \"an investor that makes a claim under Section B.\"\n\n244.\n\nMesa has consented to arbitrate in accordance with the procedures of the NAFTA and it has submitted the necessary waiver.28 it has therefore complied with the requirements of Article 1121, which the Respondent does not appear to contest.\n\nNoA \u00a73; Exhs. C-001, C-002.\n\n**b. Article 1116**\n-------------------\n\n245.\n\nArticle 1116 sets out the circumstances under which an investor may bring a claim against a NAFTA Party in the following terms:\n\n\"Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on its Own Behalf\n\n1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n\n(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A,\n\nand that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n[...]\"\n\n246.\n\nConsequently, under Article 1116, this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to claims of an \"investor\" of one NAFTA Party ((i) below) that another NAFTA Party has breached Section A (i.e. Articles 1101-1114) of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA ((ii) below).29\n\nThe Tribunal would also have jurisdiction to decide claims concerning breaches of Article 1503, which is not relevant here.\n\n(i) is the Claimant an \"investor\"?\n----------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe term \"investor\" is defined in Article 1139 as an enterprise that makes an investment:\n\n\"Article 1139: Definitions\n\nFor purposes of this Chapter:\n\ninvestor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment\n\n[...]\"\n\n248.\n\n\"Enterprise of a Party\" is in turn defined as follows:\n\n\"enterprise of a Party means an enterprise constituted or organized under the law of a Party, and a branch located in the territory of a Party and carrying out business activities there.\"30\n\nArticle 1139 of the NAFTA.\n\n249.\n\n\"Investment\" is defined broadly to Include many different types of Investments Including (in a somewhat circular manner) an enterprise, equity, debt, real estate or other property whether tangible or Intangible.\n\n250.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a71), Mesa is a U.S. corporation. Through a chain of companies registered in the U.S. and in Alberta, Canada, Mesa owns TTD, Arran, North Bruce and Summerhill, which are all unlimited liability companies Incorporated in Canada (\u00a72). In addition, Mesa holds other Interests and assets related to its renewable energy business in Canada.31\n\nMem. \u00a733 (\"in addition to the interests in the [wind projects], Mesa's interests include: (a) Real estate and other property, both tangible and intangible, including interests in lands and leases in Ontario on which wind turbines were to be built; and (b) Tangible and intangible property \u2018acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\u2019 and (c) \u2018Interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory\u2019, including rights to receive a FIT contract from the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) based upon their priority ranking.\").\n\n251.\n\nIn other words, Mesa is an Investor under Article 1139(a). It is an enterprise of a NAFTA Party which has made an Investment in the form of four \"enterprises\" and other property in another NAFTA Party. While Canada does not challenge the Claimant\u2019s status as an Investor, it objects to jurisdiction in respect of alleged breaches that are said to have occurred before Mesa made its Investment in Canada, an objection to which the Tribunal will return in the continuation of its analysis (\u00a7\u00a7319 et. seq.).\n\n(ii) Are the claims within the ambit of Section A of Chapter 11?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe second requirement for a submission to arbitration under Article 1116 is that the claims arise out of Section A of Chapter 11, i.e. Articles 1101 to 1114. In this respect, the Tribunal refers to Article 1101, which addresses the \"scope and coverage\" of Chapter\n\n11. Article 1101(1) establishes both the scope and coverage of the substantive protections accorded to Investors and Investments (Section A of Chapter 11) as well as the scope of the rights to submit disputes to arbitration under Chapter Eleven (Section B of Chapter 11) as follows:\n\n\"Article 1101: Scope and Coverage\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n[...]\"\n\n253.\n\nThus, in order for the claims to fall within the scope of Section A of Chapter 11, they must target \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party\" ((a) below) affecting investors or the investments of investors of another Party ((b) below).\n\n(a) \"Measures\"\n--------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the following measures of the Government and of the OPA, either jointly or taken together breached Articles 1102, 1103, 1105 and 1106:\n\n\u2022 Measures of the Government of Ontario :\n\nin respect of the FIT Program:\n\ni. The Electricity Act, 1998 as amended, in particular, Parts 11.1 (Ontario Power Authority) and 11.2 (Management of Electricity Supply, Capacity and Demand), including Section 25.35 (Feed-in tariff Program);\n\nii. The GEGEA and the GEA;\n\niii. The Ministerial direction of 24 September 2009, directing the OPA to establish the FIT Program and setting out the domestic content requirements to be included in the FIT Program;\n\niv. The LTEP of 23 November 2010;\n\nv. The ranking of the FIT Program applicants on 21 December 2010;\n\nvi. The Ministerial direction of 17 February 2011, which directed the OPA to plan for 10,700 MW of renewable energy generating capacity, excluding hydroelectric, by 2018;\n\nvii. The Ministerial direction of 3 June 2011, which directed the OPA to offer FIT Contracts for up to 750 MW in the Bruce Region and to set up the Connection Point Amendment Window;\n\nin respect of the GEIA:\n\ni. The conclusion of the MOU between the Ontario Ministry of Energy and the Korean Consortium on 12 December 2008;\n\nii. The alleged conclusion of a Framework Agreement between the Government of Ontario and the Korean Consortium on 25 September 2009 (signed on 29 October 2009);\n\niii. The Ministerial direction of 30 September 2009, which directed the OPA to set aside transmission capacity for the Korean Consortium;\n\niv. The conclusion of the GEIA on 21 January 2010; and\n\nv.

The FIT Contract. In particular, Section 2.4(b)(iii) and Annex D;\n\niii. The alleged failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking and evaluation of applications;\n\niv. The decision taken in August 2010 not to run the ECT;\n\nv.

The OPA\u2019s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line; and\n\nx. The award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011.\n\nReply \u00a7878(b)(iv).\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 201 of the NAFTA provides that the term \"measure Includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.\"\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent has not disputed - and rightly so - that the acts Identified by the Claimant qualify as \"measures\" under the definition of Article 201 of the NAFTA. As other tribunals have observed,33 the term \"measures\" in Article 201 must be understood broadly. While not all governmental acts necessarily constitute \"measures\",34 the Tribunal is satisfied that the acts listed above fall within the ambit of Article 201.\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. RL-010, *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3), Decision on Hearing of Respondent\u2019s Objection to Competence and Jurisdiction, 5 January 2001, \u00a753.\n\nExh. CL-104, *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2), Award, 1 November 1999 ***(\"Azinian\"),*** \u00a787.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in its Memorial, the Claimant listed some acts of Hydro One and IESO, which it claims to be attributable to the Government of Ontario and, therefore, to Canada. The Claimant noted in particular that IESO was part of the \"Korean Consortium Working Group\" and that, in 2010 and 2011, IESO and Hydro One met with the Claimant\u2019s competitors to discuss a connection to a 500 kV transmission line.35 For the reasons set forth below (\u00a7376), the Tribunal has not listed them among the measures referred to above.\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7234, 578, 633, 671.\n\n258.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the Tribunal further notes that not all of the measures identified in (\u00a7254) above are relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the merits of the dispute. Indeed, for reasons that it will express later, it considers that it lacks jurisdiction over the measures that were already in existence at the time when Mesa invested in Canada.\n\n(b) Measures \"relating to\" investors or the investments of investors\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nAs mentioned above, to fall within the ambit of Section A of Chapter 11, the impugned measures must \"relate to\" an investor of another NAFTA Party or to investments of such an investor. In the context of the present dispute, this means that all of the measures identified in (\u00a7254) above must have a causal nexus with the Claimant or its investment.36 Having reviewed each of the measures identified in \u00a7254 above, the Tribunal considers that all of them have a causal link with the Claimant and its investments, a position which the Respondent does not appear to dispute.\n\nExh. RL-045, *Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2), Award, 18 September 2009 ***(\"Cargill\"),*** \u00a7174 (\"Article 1101 has a causal connection requirement as well: the measures adopted or maintained by Respondent must be those \u2018relating to\u2019 investors of another Party or investments of investors of another Party.\").\n\n260.\n\nThus, the acts identified by the Respondent are \"measures\" under Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA. Further, they relate to the Claimant and its investments. Thus, the requirements of Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA are met.\n\n261.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant is an investor and that its claims fall within the scope of Section A of Chapter 11. As a result, the Tribunal holds that the requirements of Article 1116(1) have been met.\n\n**c. Article 1118**\n-------------------\n\n262.\n\nAnother condition to submit a claim to arbitration is set out in Article 1118, which provides that the Parties must attempt to settle their dispute amicably:\n\n\"Article 1118: Settlement of a Claim through Consultation and Negotiation\n\nThe disputing parties should first attempt to settle a claim through consultation or negotiation.\"\n\n263.\n\nThe Respondent initially argued that the Parties had not entered Into consultations under Article 1118. It contended that, although it had offered to hold consultations with the Claimant through its letters of 13 July, 21 September, 30 September, 28 October, and 30 December 2011, \"[t]he Claimant accepted none of these offers and no consultations have occurred.\"37\n\nCanada\u2019s Objection to Jurisdiction dated 3 December 2012 **(\"Objection to Jurisdiction\") \u00a716.**\n\n264.\n\nIn reality, the record shows that the Claimant had sought consultations on 6 July 2011, prior to the Respondent\u2019s purported Invitation of 13 July 2011.38 This fact is also evidenced by two documents to which the Claimant referred in rebutting Canada\u2019s allegations.39 Mesa also supplied its responses to the Respondent\u2019s Invitations40 and noted that there has been \"a series of privileged exchanges of correspondence under the terms of NAFTA Article 1118\", but that no consultations materialized because of \"a disagreement between the Investor and Canada over the lack of confirmation that Canada\u2019s delegation would Include those persons responsible for the measures in dispute from the Government of Ontario to ensure that consultations between the parties were meaningful.\"41\n\nExhs. C-005, 099, 100.\n\nMem. \u00a7819.\n\nExhs. C-103, 104, 114.\n\nAnswer on Jurisdiction \u00a733.\n\n265.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, these facts are sufficient to meet the condition of Article 1118. in any event, the Tribunal notes that after the Claimant\u2019s additional submissions, the Respondent appears to have dropped this argument.\n\n**d. Article 1119**\n-------------------\n\n266.\n\nArticle 1119 provides that 90 days before submission of a claim to arbitration, an Investor must send a Notice of Intent to the disputing Party:\n\n\"Article 1119: Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration\n\nThe disputing investor shall deliver to the disputing Party written notice of its intention to submit a claim to arbitration at least 90 days before the claim is submitted\n\n[...]\"\n\n267.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Claimant delivered its Notice of Intent on 6 July 2011, and filed its Notice of Arbitration 90 days later on 4 October 2011. This requirement is, therefore, satisfied.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Claimant\u2019s inclusion into its Notice of Arbitration of events occurring after its Notice of Intent.42 This objection is addressed in the context of the Respondent\u2019s Article 1120 objection below.\n\nObjection to Jurisdiction \u00a740.\n\n**2. Article 1120 Objection**\n-----------------------------\n\n269.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of Article 1120 deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction over the present dispute or a part of it. The Tribunal first reproduces the Parties\u2019 positions ((a) and (b) below) and the Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 submissions ((c) below) and then discusses its reasons ((d) below).\n\n**a. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the NAFTA Parties have conditioned their consent to arbitration on a potential claimant following the procedures set out in Articles 1118 to 1121 of the NAFTA. In this case, the Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration on 4 October 2011, only three months after it was not awarded a FIT Contract, which is the event that precipitated its claim. By doing so, it disregarded Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA that required it to wait six months after the events in question to submit a claim to arbitration. Since the Claimant did not comply with Article 1120(1), Canada has not consented to arbitrate the claims before this Tribunal. As a result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimant\u2019s argument that Article 1120(1) does not require that *all* the events giving rise to a claim occurred six months before the notice of arbitration. It submits that the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"events giving rise to a claim\" in Article 1120(1) designates *each and every* event which led to the claim. If the intent had been to refer only to some of the events or to the first event in the chain, the singular term \"event\" or language such as \"any of the events\" would have been used.\n\n272.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s Interpretation of Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA destroys the very purpose of that provision. Article 1120(1) provides a respondent with six months to acquire knowledge of the facts of a possible claim. This time period is especially Important when the source of the claim is a measure taken by a sub-national government. Further, Article 1120 is entitled \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration.\" The words \"a claim\" do not refer to any claim, but to the claim that is being submitted to arbitration. If the claims cover multiple breaches or numerous events, then Article 1120(1) requires that six months have passed since all of the events giving rise to any aspect of the claim have occurred.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that Articles 1118-1120 must be read and Interpreted together. The consultation provisions of Article 1118 and the notice of potential claims in Article 1119 are embodied in the purpose of Article 1120. There is nothing Inconsistent about these provisions being understood as notice provisions. Articles 1119 and 1120 combined, pursue the same objective as Article Vl(3)(a) of the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning The Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment **(\"US-Ecuador BIT\").** Therefore, the Claimant\u2019s efforts to distinguish *Burlington* and *Murphy* (both of which considered this **BIT)** are Ill-placed. The fact that notice and consultation requirements are Included in a single provision in the US-Ecuador BIT (because the periods are the same) rather than in separate provisions like in the NAFTA (because the periods are different) is Irrelevant.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimant is wrong to argue that the phrase \"events giving rise to a claim\" in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA can Include knowledge of future events. It notes that Article 1120(1) requires time to have \"elapsed\" in the past tense. Moreover, the Claimant\u2019s reliance on *Ethyl* is misguided. In that case, the tribunal took a \"future event\" Into account because its occurrence was a certainty. By contrast, here the earlier events, i.e. the rankings and the treatment of the Korean Consortium, did not entail that the June 3 Direction would be Issued or the FIT Contracts awarded as they were on 4 July 2011. For the Respondent, \"[t]he earlier events may be relevant to what happened later in time, but they are not the sort of events that could lead one to say that the Claimant knew at that point that the future events which actually gave rise to its claims were going to occur.\"43\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7251.\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimant is also wrong, so says the Respondent, in its argument that the 3 June 2011 Direction and the award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011 \"are part of a composite act which commenced long before\" those dates, with the result that the requirements of Article 1120(1) would be met. The Respondent points to the Commentary on Article 15 of the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission **(\"ILC Articles\"),** pursuant to which what is relevant is the time when the alleged wrongful act occurred. In the case of a composite act, a \"claim\" only arises when \"sufficient\" events taken together have occurred to constitute the allegedly wrongful act. It is only when six months have elapsed since this date that a claim can be submitted to arbitration. By filing its claim merely three months after the disputed award of the FIT Contracts, the Claimant failed to fulfil the requirements of Article 1120(1), even if the measures complained of were considered as a composite act.\n\n276.\n\nIn any event, even if the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article 1120(1) were correct, no claim exists under NAFTA Article 1116(1) until a challenged measure allegedly causes harm. The events before 4 July 2011 were not susceptible of causing harm and thus could not \"give rise to a claim.\" Indeed, no claim could have arisen before 4 July 2011, when the Claimant was refused a FIT Contract. As a consequence, even under its own interpretation, the Claimant should have waited for six months after 4 July 2011 to submit its claim to arbitration.\n\n277.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that it is irrelevant whether attempts to resolve the dispute would have been successful or not. It adds that Mesa has in any event not shown that negotiations would have been futile. It is equally irrelevant for Canada that six months have elapsed since the filing of the Notice of Arbitration. The contrary \"would render waiting period clauses such as Article 1120 superfluous and without consequence.\"44\n\nObjection to Jurisdiction \u00a735.\n\n278.\n\nOn this basis, and in reliance on *Burlington, Murphy* and other authorities, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claim in its entirety. At the very least, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal should dismiss the claims arising from events which occurred within the six-month period preceding the Notice of Arbitration. Since the latter was filed on 4 October 2011, this means that the Tribunal should dismiss claims arising out of events which occurred after 4 April 2011.\n\n**b. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Canada has \"clearly\" consented to this arbitration. It contends that there are no Irregularities in the submission of its claim to arbitration and that, even if there were any, it would not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Indeed, relying on authorities such as *Ethyl, Lauder and Biwater,* the Claimant argues that objections based on Article 1120(1) are procedural and not jurisdictional in nature.\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimant also refutes Canada\u2019s argument that Article 1120(1) requires an Investor to wait six months after all of its possible claims have materialized, rather than waiting for six months after \"a claim\" has arisen. For the Claimant, Canada\u2019s Interpretation is contrary to Article 102 of the NAFTA and Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. It would be \"absurd\" to require an Investor to wait six months from every subsequent breach to bring a claim in respect of a prior breach. If that were the case, continuous and on-going breaches would in effect bar a tribunal from ever deciding a claim. As long as a NAFTA Party kept committing wrongful acts, the Investor would be unable to launch a claim.\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes that Articles 1118 and 1119 are duplicated by Implication Into Article 1120, which would \"serve no practical, logical or conceptual purpose.\"45 it finds Canada\u2019s proposition directly contrary to the plain text of the NAFTA and to the deliberate drafting of Articles 1118, 1119 and 1120 as distinct requirements, each providing separately for consultation (Article 1118), notice of dispute (Article 1119) and a cooling-off period (Article 1120). Article 1120(1) does not Impose an additional notice requirement as Canada contends. Only Article 1119 requires \"written notice of [an Investor's] Intention to submit a claim to arbitration.\"\n\nMem. \u00a7837.\n\n282.\n\nMesa disagrees with Canada\u2019s reliance on *Burlington* and *Murphy* because of the differences in the notice provisions of the US-Ecuador BIT and the NAFTA. Instead of one notice provision, Into which time for consultation was Implied, the NAFTA contains three separate and distinct requirements in Articles 1118, 1119 and 1120. The essential purpose of Article VI (3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT is reflected in Article 1119, which provides for the state to be informed of a dispute, so it can collect information and engage in consultations as provided in Article 1118. In other words, the NAFTA Parties rejected the single provision approach in favor of three separate requirements contained in Articles 1118, 1119, 1120 which cannot be ignored.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the 3 June Direction and the 4 July award of FIT Contracts \"are part of a composite act which commenced long before.\" The ILC Articles consider that it is the earliest date in a series of events which gives rise to a composite breach. As both events in question are related to earlier events (the domestic content requirements in the FIT Program; the failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking and evaluation of the Claimant\u2019s applications; the preferential treatment given to the Korean Consortium and other FIT applicants), the requirement of Article 1120(1) is met.\n\n284.\n\nIn rebuttal of the argument that, for a composite act, \"sufficient\" events must exist to satisfy Article 1120(1), the Claimant submits that a tribunal should look to the investor\u2019s good faith understanding of its claim to determine at what point in time \"sufficient\" events do exist. It must consider the wrongful conduct which is the basis of the claim and \"ask, based upon the investor\u2019s theory of law, are there \u2018sufficient\u2019 acts and omissions six months prior to filing the Notice that, if proven, would establish internationally wrongful conduct of a sort that would allow the investor to succeed with the claim as filed?\" if the investor came to the conclusion in good faith that it had a claim at a particular point in time and waited six months from that time, the waiting period should not bar the claims.\n\n285.\n\nIn respect of Canada\u2019s argument that Article 1116(1) requires a showing of harm, the Claimant responds that Article 1120(1) speaks of \"events\" that give rise to a claim, nothing more. In particular, Article 1120(1) does not require an investor to demonstrate that each \"event\" caused harm. For the Claimant, \"[a]n event is not the same as a \u2018breach\u2019; rather an event, or series of events, can give rise to a breach, which in turn give rise to a claim [...] \u2018Events giving rise to a claim\u2019 cannot mean an investor needs to demonstrate each and every event caused loss or damage.\"46\n\nReply \u00a7840.\n\n286.\n\nTo counter the Respondent\u2019s submission that a notice under Article 1120(1) is required for the state to consult with its regional entities, the Claimant notes that a meaningful consultation would in any event not have been possible. There was no Indication that the Federal Government was prepared to offer monetary compensation and it was reasonable to assume that any consultation without the engagement of the Government of Ontario would have been futile.\n\n287.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant also argues that Canada has failed to establish any unfair surprise or bad faith on the Claimant\u2019s part. It has not shown that the lack of a six month cooling-off period with respect to some events compromised the possibility of settlement or turned out to be detrimental to Canada in these proceedings.\n\n288.\n\nFinally, Mesa submits that \"[p]ractical and efficient approaches should be preferred by NAFTA Tribunals to best serve the NAFTA\u2019s objectives to enhance the resolution of disputes in the NAFTA region\", and that Canada\u2019s Interpretation of Article 1120(1) \"is entirely contrary to the effective settlement of disputes.\" if Canada\u2019s Interpretation is adopted, later events could only be addressed by filing a new claim and constituting a new tribunal, which would be costly and wasteful as two different tribunals would consider events which occurred at different times, but are part of the same composite or continuing breach.\n\n**c. The Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nMexico submits that the NAFTA Parties consented to arbitration upon compliance with the procedural requirements stipulated in Articles 1116-1121 of the NAFTA. Thus, tribunals must ensure that a claimant complies with all of the requirements set out in these provisions.\n\n290.\n\nit further Insists that Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA requires six months to have elapsed from the time when the allegedly wrongful act occurred. The claim must be ripe at the time it is filed. The waiting period provided in Article 1120(1) plays an Important role in the overall operation of Chapter 11, \"which is to provide a respondent Party with six months to learn of the events that may give rise to a claim, to meet with any potential claimants and to attempt to remedy the problem if appropriate.\" if a claim is submitted before the end of the six-month waiting period, a tribunal would lack jurisdiction even if such period elapsed by the time the tribunal was constituted.\n\n291.\n\nThe U.S. equally submits that no claim can be brought to arbitration unless the requirements of Chapter 11 are met. For the U.S., \"[t]ogether wlth the notice requirement in Article 1119, the \u2018cooling-off\u2019 requirement in Article 1120(1) affords a NAFTA Party time to identify and assess potential disputes, coordinate among relevant national and sub-national officials, and consider amicable settlement or other courses of action prior to arbitration.\" Consequently, any claim for which a claimant has not waited six months from the relevant events is not submitted in accordance with Article 1120(1). Hence, the submission does not satisfy the requirements of consent contained in Articles 1121 and 1122 of the NAFTA.\n\n292.\n\nThe U.S. further submits that there can be no claim under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA until an investor has suffered harm from an alleged breach. Read together, Articles 1116(1) and 1120(1) of the NAFTA provide that a disputing investor may submit a claim to arbitration under Chapter 11 \"only for a breach that already has occurred and for which damage or loss has already been incurred, provided that six months has elapsed from the events giving rise to the claim. No claim based solely on speculation as to future breaches or future loss may be submitted.\"\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n293.\n\nArticle 1120(1) provides for a six-month waiting period before the submission of a claim to arbitration. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Article 1120: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1. Except as provided in Annex 1120.1, and provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to a claim, a disputing investor may submit the claim to arbitration [...]\"\n\n294.\n\nAs set out above, the Respondent contends that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction because the Claimant has failed to comply with this six-month waiting period. Alternatively, it submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over claims arising out of the two events that occurred within the six-month period preceding the Notice of Arbitration. The Claimant opposes these submissions on numerous grounds.\n\n295.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the Tribunal must interpret Article 1120(1). It will do so in application of the principles of interpretation identified above (\u00a7\u00a7231 et. seq.) and bearing in mind the objectives stated in Article 102(1) of the NAFTA.\n\n296.\n\nAt the outset, it bears recalling the reason why States provide for cooling off or waiting periods in investment treaties. The object and purpose of these periods is to appraise the State of a possible dispute and to provide it with an opportunity to remedy the situation before the investor initiates an arbitration.47 in most bilateral Investment treaties, notice and consultation period requirements are Included in a single provision.48 By contrast, the NAFTA deals with this matter in three distinct provisions. Article 1118 of the NAFTA provides that disputing parties should attempt to settle a claim through consultation or negotiation. Article 1119 requires a disputing Party to send a written notice of its Intent to submit a claim to arbitration at least 90 days before the submission. The notice must specify the provisions of the Agreement alleged to have been breached as well as the Issues and the factual basis for the claim. A different provision - Article 1120 - addresses the submission of a claim to arbitration and specifies that six months must have elapsed since the events giving rise to a claim.\n\nExh. RL-002, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, \u00a7312. See also *Western NIS Enterprise Fund v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/2), Order, 16 March 2006, \u00a75 (\"[the six-month waiting period requirement] allows the State, acting through its competent organs, to examine and possibly resolve the dispute by negotiations.\").\n\nFor instance, Article VI of the US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (on which the Respondent has relied in its submissions) provides: \"(2) in the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation [...] (3)(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2(a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration.\"\n\n297.\n\nTypically, consultations between the disputing parties take place after a notice of Intent has been submitted.49 Thus, through the notice of Intent - in which an Investor must articulate its claims with a reasonable degree of specificity - a disputing NAFTA Party is informed of the claims against it. It then has at least 90 days to consider and possibly settle the claims. The six-month period in Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA provides an additional opportunity to resolve the dispute amicably.50 The six-month period is an additional requirement. While it may partially overlap with the 90 days of Article 1119, it is a distinct condition deriving from a separate provision.\n\nExh. CL-6, Re Notices of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration (2003) (FTC) (\"Efforts to settle NAFTA investment claims through consultation or negotiation have generally taken place only after the delivery of the notice of intent. The notice of intent naturally serves as the basis for consultation or negotiations between the disputing investor and the competent authorities of a Party\"). See also Meg Kinnear et. al. (eds.), Investment Disputes under NAFTA (2006, Kluwer Law International) 1119-13. The Parties agree (Mem. \u00a7844-845, C-Mem. \u00a7244).\n\nExh. RL-031, Canadian Statement of Implementation, p. 154.\n\n298.\n\nHaving thus explained the object and purpose of Article 1120(1) in the context of the other provisions of the NAFTA, the Tribunal will now turn to the Parties\u2019 arguments. They diverge in particular on the significance of the words \"events giving rise to a claim\" in Article 1120(1). According to the Respondent, the ordinary meaning of this phrase entails that *every* event which gives rise to a claim must have occurred at least six months prior to the submission of that claim to arbitration.51 By contrast, the Claimant contends that the requirement of Article 1120(1) is satisfied, provided *some* of the events giving rise to the claim have occurred more than six months before the start of the arbitration.\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7240 (\"Article 1120 requires that six months have passed since all of the events giving rise to any aspect of the claim have occurred before submitting it to arbitration.\").\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant on this issue. If the Respondent\u2019s argument were followed, every new event related to a claim would require a claimant to wait for a new six months period before starting arbitration. This would apply however secondary or ancillary the new event may be. If events relating to the same claim kept occurring, a claimant would effectively be precluded from ever initiating an arbitration. This interpretation would effectively deprive Article 1116(1) (that entitles investors to submit a claim to arbitration) of *effet utile,* an outcome that is contrary to treaty interpretation rules.\n\n300.\n\nMoreover, Article 102(1)(e) of the NAFTA, which this Tribunal must take into consideration when interpreting Article 1120(1), sets out the object and purpose of the Agreement as \"creat[ing] effective procedures [...] for the resolution of disputes.\" it could hardly be said that this objective is satisfied by an interpretation of Article 1120(1) requiring the Claimant to initiate a new arbitration in respect of two out of a series of events that give rise to the claims before this Tribunal. This would clearly be counterproductive in terms of effective dispute settlement and would trigger the usual drawbacks of multiple proceedings, including a waste of resources and risks of conflicting decisions.52 This is particularly true here where sufficient events giving rise to the claim had already occurred before the six-month cooling-off period - and all the more so considering that the Respondent was fully notified of the claims in accordance with Article 1119 of the NAFTA. Indeed, in its Notice of Intent of 6 July 2011, the Claimant had identified the 3 June Direction and the refusal to award the FIT Contracts of 4 July as events giving rise to its claim.53 By the time the Notice of Arbitration was filed on 4 October 2011, the Respondent was well aware of all the events giving rise to the Claimant\u2019s claim. It was not somehow taken by surprise by the claims mentioned in the Notice of Arbitration.54\n\nOther tribunals have adopted a similar approach. See for instance, Exh. CL-2, *Ethyl Corporation v. The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction, 24 June 1998, \u00a785; and Exh. CL-3, *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award Concerning the Motion by Government of Canada Respecting the Claim based upon Imposition of the \"Super Fee\", 7 August 2000,\u00a727.\n\nNotice of Intent \u00a734 (\"The Measures at issue raised in this dispute include, but are not limited to [...]: FIT direction dated June 3.2011 \"); \u00a719 (\"On July 4.2011 the Wind Farm Investments consequently lost their priority ranking and were not offered FIT Program contracts, because of the 750 MW limit on awards in the Bruce Region [...]\").\n\nTwo events were listed in the Notice of Arbitration although were not in the Notice of Intent because they occurred after the filing of the Notice of Intent: (i) that the Government of Ontario withdrew its ability to terminate FIT Contracts for cause; (\u00a1\u00a1) that the Government of Ontario extended the duration of the special preferences given to the Korean Consortium by a year (Submission on Jurisdiction, \u00a718). The Claimant submits that \"[n]either of these two events constituted a specific new breach of the NAFTA, but each fact was relevant to the evaluation of the breaches by the Tribunal\" (Submission on Jurisdiction, \u00a718). In the circumstances, these events are irrelevant to the present analysis. The Tribunal has considered them in the context of its analysis of the Claimant\u2019s Article 1105 claim below.\n\n301.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the six-month requirement in Article 1120(1) must be deemed met if sufficient events giving rise to a claim exist six months prior to the submission of the dispute to arbitration. If additional events occur within the six-month period which are part of the claim brought to arbitration, they can be regarded as not affecting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over that claim. This is all the more the case where the additional events are foreseeable, as was the case in *Ethyl.55* The Respondent appears to agree with this position, albeit in a different context.56\n\nIn *Ethyl,* the event falling within the cooling-off period was legislation that had not come into effect at the time the arbitration was initiated. See CL-2, \u00a7\u00a787-88.\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7255 (\"[F]or the purposes of Article 1120, what is relevant is the time that the alleged wrongful act resulting in damage to the Claimant occurred, and by consequence a claim, arose. In the case of a composite act, a \u2018claim\u2019 arises only when, taken together, there are enough acts or omissions sufficient to constitute the allegedly wrongful act. It is only once six months have elapsed from this date that a claim can be validly submitted to arbitration under Article 1120 of the NAFTA.\").\n\n302.\n\nHaving reached this understanding, the Tribunal must now review what the \"claim\" is and whether sufficient events giving rise to the claim existed prior to the six-month period.57 On the facts of this case, the latter review essentially Involves determining whether the 3 June Direction and 4 July award of FIT Contracts are part of the same subject-matter as the prior events.58\n\nThis was the approach of the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot* albeit in a different context. There, the Tribunal first determined what the precise claim was in that proceeding, before proceeding to determine whether a later occurring fact could be included within that claim (Exh. CL-3).\n\nSee generally Exh. CL-321, *CMS v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, \u00a7109 (The tribunal noted that \"as long as [multiple different actions] [allegedly] affect the investor in violation of its rights and cover the same subject matter, the fact that they may originate from different sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily mean that the disputes are separate and distinct.\"); Exh. CL-282, *Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1), Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, \u00a7123 (\"[i]nternational jurisprudence suggests that the *subject matter of* the negotiations should be the same as the dispute that is brought before the court or tribunal.\").\n\n303.\n\nIn its Notice of Intent the Claimant described its claim as being about:\n\n\"[...] unfairness, the abuse of power and process and undue political interference in the regulation of renewable energy in Ontario through the unannounced last-minute imposition of arbitrary measures and through opaque and secret administration and \u2018buy local\u2019 contract requirements.\n\nThe government changed the regulatory framework without notice and without due process, so as directly to curtail and impair market access rights under the established scheme for renewable energy in Ontario.\"\n\n304.\n\nIt then identified most of the numerous measures listed above (\u00a7254) as the \"Measures at issue raised in this dispute.\"59\n\nNotice of Intent \u00a734.\n\n305.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant then stated as follows:\n\n\"THE GENERAL NATURE OF THE CLAIM\n\n6. This claim arises out of the arbitrary and unfair application of various government measures related to the regulation and production of renewable energy in Ontario. Canada, through its sub-national organs imposed sudden and discriminatory changes to the established scheme for renewable energy, namely the Feed-in-Tariff Program (the \"FIT Program\").\"\n\n306.\n\nIn this context as well, it referred to most of the same measures enumerated above (\u00a7254) as the measures in dispute.\n\n307.\n\nThus, the claim submitted to this Tribunal principally involves the acts of the Government and the OPA in relation to the FIT Program and the GEIA. These acts allegedly breach various provisions of the NAFTA: Article 1102 (national treatment); Article 1103 (most-favored-nation treatment), Article 1105 (minimum standard of treatment); and Article 1106 (performance requirements). It is clear from the Notice of Intent and the Notice of Arbitration that the Tribunal was called to consider not only the acts of the governmental authorities, but also the effects of those acts on the Claimant.\n\n308.\n\nThe claim having being identified, the Tribunal must now examine whether sufficient events giving rise to such claim existed prior to the six-month period of Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent has breached Articles 1102, 1103, 1105 and Article 1106. It is not disputed that the events giving rise to the Article 1106 claim arose before 4 April 2011 i.e. before the six-month cooling-off period. The events giving rise to the claims under Articles 1102, 1103, and 1105 also appear to have occurred before the commencement of the cooling-off period. Indeed, by 4 April 2011, most of the events listed above (\u00a7254) had already occurred: the OPA had (allegedly incorrectly) ranked the Claimant\u2019s FIT projects (on 21 December 2010); available transmission capacity had been reduced (because of reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium from 12 December 2008, and because of the LTEP of 23 November 2010); and capacity had been reserved for the Korean Consortium (through the GEIA of 21 January 2010 and its predecessor agreements), particularly in the Bruce Region (on 17 September 2010). These events were sufficient to give rise to the claims based on Articles 1102, 1103, and 1105.\n\n310.\n\nThese observations are corroborated by the fact that the two events within the six-month period, the 3 June Direction and 4 July award of FIT Contracts, were merely developments of events that had taken place earlier before the six-month period, i.e. before 4 April 2011. The impugned events were - to borrow the Claimant\u2019s expression - \"interrelated\" with earlier events60:\n\n\u2022 The 3 June Direction limited the available transmission capacity in the Bruce Region to 750 MW. It further established the Connection Point Amendment Window. Both of these measures largely resulted from earlier events which had reduced the available transmission capacity. In December 2010, the OPA estimated that 1200 MW transmission capacity would be available to projects in the Bruce Region. However, through the LTEP of 23 November 2010 and the Ministerial direction of 17 February 2011, the Government directed the OPA to plan for 10,700 MW of renewable energy generating capacity by 2018. Further, through the GEIA (and its predecessor agreements), the Government reserved available transmission capacity for the Korean Consortium. It was because of the limitations on available transmission capacity61 that, on 3 June 2011, the Government directed the OPA to award contracts up to 750 MW and establish the Connection Point Amendment Window.\n\n\u2022 The 4 July award of FIT Contracts was equally the result of events that had taken place prior to 4 April 2011. By that date the OPA had already ranked the Claimant\u2019s projects.62 By then, the Government had also limited the transmission capacity to be awarded to renewable energy projects. This capacity was further limited by the reservation for the Korean Consortium. As the Respondent\u2019s expert testified, had capacity not been reserved for the Korean Consortium in the Bruce Region, the Claimant would have been awarded a FIT Contract for its Arran and TTD projects.63 These events, which are all \"events giving rise to a claim\", eventually led to the Claimant not being awarded a FIT Contract on 4 July 2011.\n\nSubmission on Jurisdiction \u00a756.\n\nSee Sue Lo WS I \u00a7\u00a737 *et. seq.;* Tr. (28 October 2014) 132:6-133:13.\n\nIn its letter of 20 May 2011, the Claimant also sought clarifications of the ranking process (Exh. C-10).\n\nTr. (30 October 2014) 159:4-12 (\"Turning to the GEIA counter factual, we then take away the breach, which is the 500-megawatt allocation of transmission capacity to the Korean Consortium. So you now have, at that dotted brown bar, a 1,250-megawatt available transmission capacity. And as you can see, TTD and Arran make the cut and get FIT contracts in that scenario, but Summerhill and North Bruce did not.\").\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondent next argues that, pursuant to Article 1116, no claim exists until an investor has allegedly suffered harm arising from a measure allegedly in breach of the NAFTA.64 According to it, Mesa could not have suffered damage before 4 July 2011, when it was not awarded a FIT Contract. As this date falls within the six-month period prescribed by Article 1120(1), the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the present dispute.\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7247-248.\n\n312.\n\nArticle 1116(1) stipulates that a party may initiate an arbitration claiming that (i) a NAFTA Party has breached Section A of Chapter 11 and that (ii) it incurred loss or damage as a result of that breach. It is undisputed that the first element - a claim for breach of Section A of Chapter 11 - is complied with. Indeed, in its Notices of Intent and of Arbitration, the Claimant alleged violations of Articles 1102, 1103, 1104, 1105 and 1106, all of which fall within Section A of Chapter 11 of the NAFTA.\n\n313.\n\nFor the second component - loss or damage caused by the breach - the Respondent appears to suggest that the Claimant must have actually suffered a loss or damage six months before the start of the arbitration. However, this is not what Article 1116(1) states. it merely requires the investor to \"claim\" that it has incurred harm due to the breach. It is not for the investor to prove at this early stage that it has actually suffered a loss or damage. Proof of actual damage is a matter for the merits, as opposed to the jurisdiction phase of the arbitration.\n\n314.\n\nNeither is there a requirement under Article 1120(1) that an investor wait six months after Incurring loss or damage before submitting its claim to arbitration. As noted above, Article 1120(1) simply requires that six-months elapse between the \"events giving rise to a claim\", and the submission of the claim to arbitration. Hence, it is the \"events giving rise\" to the claim of loss or damage (under Article 1116(1)) that must occur six months previously, not the actual Incurring of the loss or damage Itself.\n\n315.\n\nA similar question arose in *Methanex.* There, a Canadian Investor claimed that its Investment would be adversely affected by a ban on a gasoline additive. At the time of the submission of the claim, the ban had been proposed, but had not come Into effect. The respondent challenged jurisdiction on the basis that the Investor had not suffered and could not suffer any loss because the ban was not in effect yet. In rejecting this challenge, the tribunal observed that it was \"an Indisputable fact that Methanex has made \u2018a claim...that [Methanex] has Incurred loss and damage\u2019.\" it added that \"the plain meaning of this provision [i.e. Article 1116(1)] does not require, as a jurisdictional matter, the claimant to prove loss and damage.\"\n\n316.\n\nThe NAFTA tribunal in *Mobil* also considered the question whether a breach giving rise to future and prospective damage fell within the ambit of Article 1116(1). There, the tribunal was asked to determine, *inter alia,* whether Canada had Imposed Impermissible performance requirements within the meaning of Article 1106(1)(c) on the foreign Investor, subject to the exceptions of Article 1108. The claimants sought compensation for the Incremental expenditures that they would Incur as a result of the application of the performance requirements from the time that they came Into force until 2036. Relying on Article 1116(1), Canada argued that the Tribunal could not award damages for prospective losses that were Incurred after the filing of the claim. The majority of the tribunal, however, took a broader view accepting that future damages were covered by Article 1116:\n\n\"A breach giving rise to future and prospective damage may, in general terms, fall within Article 1116. There is nothing in the language of Article 1116 (1) that convinces us that the provision is directed only to damages that occurred in the past and does not extend, in principle, to damages that are the result of a breach which began in the past [...] and continues\n\n[...] resulting in the incurring of losses which crystallise (i.e. become quantifiable) and must be paid sometime in the future [,..].\"65\n\nExh. CL-18, *Mobil Investments Inc. & Murphy Oil Corporation v. Government of Canada* (ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/07/4), Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012 ***(\"Mobil*** \" ***),***  \u00a7427.\n\n317.\n\nThus, the *Mobil* tribunal recognised that its jurisdiction was not limited to losses that had occurred in the past, but extended to future damages resulting from a breach that had begun in the past. This is precisely the case here. The limitation of capacity because of the LTEP and the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium through the GEIA of January 2010 and its predecessor agreements - both of which occurred outside the cooling-off period - resulted in the non-award of FIT Contracts to the Claimant on 4 July 2011. The loss may have accrued on 4 July 2011, but it merely resulted from the earlier governmental acts. As a result, this Tribunal is not barred from hearing the present dispute even though damages (if any) were actually incurred by the Claimant within the six-month waiting period of Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA.\n\n318.\n\nThus, for the reasons just discussed, the Tribunal denies the Respondent\u2019s objections concerning Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA. It holds that the requirements of Article 1120(1) have been complied with. As a consequence, it can dispense with determining whether these requirements go to consent and are thus jurisdictional or whether they are procedural and could accordingly be satisfied by the passage of time.\n\n**3.** ***Ratione temporis*** **Objection**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims for breaches that occurred prior to the time when the Claimant invested in Canada. The Parties\u2019 positions are summarised in (a) and (b) below, and the Tribunal\u2019s analysis is set out in (d).\n\n**a. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nInvoking Articles 1101(1) and 1116(1), the Respondent submits that for Chapter 11 to apply, an investment \"of an investor of another party\" must already have existed at the time of the disputed measure. An investor cannot challenge measures that were already in existence when it made its investment. Put differently, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to rule on a challenged measure, unless an investor can establish that it had made its investment before the measure was adopted. Following this reasoning, as the Claimant\u2019s project companies TTD and Arran were incorporated on 17 November 2009, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the measures which occurred prior to this date with respect to these projects. Similarly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over measures affecting North Bruce and Summerhill which were taken before 6 April 2010, which is the date when the respective project companies were Incorporated.66\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7263-269.\n\n**b. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Claimant opposes the Respondent\u2019s submissions. Article 1139 defines an \"Investor of a Party\" as someone \"that seeks to make, is making or has made an Investment\", a definition that Mesa meets. It specifies that \"[Mesa] made its Initial Investments in Canada by August 14, 2009 [...] Mesa actually began looking to Invest in Ontario in March 2009, and began due diligence and transaction work in July 2009.\" According to it \"NAFTA\u2019s protection extends to Mesa in August 2009.\"67\n\nC-PHB \u00a7\u00a7356-357.\n\n322.\n\nIf the Respondent\u2019s argument that Mesa\u2019s Investments were made only in November 2009 were accepted, the Claimant contends that it would make no difference. The NAFTA provisions would still apply to the Claimant as of August 2009, because Article 1139 \"extends to a situation in which an Investor has purchased a good or service in the country of another state party but has yet to formally Incorporate such Investment.\"\n\n**c. The Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor Mexico have made any particular submissions on this Issue.\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n324.\n\nArticle 1101 circumscribes the scope of application of the treaty, and Article 1116(1) gives Indications about the relevant breaches, in the following terms:\n\n\"Article 1101: Scope and Coverage\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) Investors of another Party;\n\n(b) Investments of Investors of another Party in the territory of the Party.\n\n[...]\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on its Own Behalf\n\n1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises)\n\n[...]\n\nand that the Investor has Incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n[...]\"\n\n325.\n\nThe scope of application so defined limits the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction for the obvious reason that the latter derives from the dispute settlement provisions embodied in Chapter 11. Consequently, there is no jurisdiction if disputed measures are not \"relating to Investors\" or to \"Investments of an Investor.\"68 in addition to these express provisions of Chapter 11, the same conclusion arises as a general matter from the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties.69 State conduct cannot be governed by rules that are not applicable when the conduct occurs.\n\nSee Exh. RL-046, *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2), Award, 17 September 2009, \u00a7\u00a7112-114 (\"it is undisputed that an investor seeking access to international jurisdiction pursuant to an investment treaty must prove that it was an investor at the relevant time, i.e., at the moment when the events on which its claim is based occurred\"); See also *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Award, 2 September 2011, \u00a7\u00a7 121-128 (\"it is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the merits depends on whether Libananco owned CEAS and Kepez shares at the time of the alleged expropriation... In order to establish jurisdiction, the Claimant must prove that it owned CEAS and Kepez shares during the time at which it claims the acts constituting a violation of the ECT were committed by the Respondent.\").\n\nSee Article 28 of the VCLT. See also Article 13 of the ILC Articles.\n\n326.\n\nAs a consequence, Investment arbitration tribunals have repeatedly found that they do not have jurisdiction *ratione temporis* unless the claimant can establish that it had an Investment at the time the challenged measure was adopted. In the NAFTA context, the Tribunal in *Vito Gallo* observed:\n\n\"[F]or Chapter 11 of the NAFTA to apply to a measure relating to an Investment, that Investment must be owned or controlled by an Investor of another party, and ownership or control must exist at the time the measure which allegedly violates the Treaty is adopted or maintained. In a claim under Art. 1117 the Investor must prove that he owned or controlled directly or indirectly the \u2018juridical person\u2019 holding the investment, at the critical time.\n\nAs the Tribunal in *Phoenix* declared, it does not need extended explanation to assert that a tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to consider claims arising prior to the date of the alleged investment, because the treaty cannot be applied to acts committed by a State before the claimant invested in the host country. In the present case, the Claimant must have owned or controlled the Enterprise at the time when the AMLA was enacted. And since the Tribunal has already found that the Claimant has failed to marshal the evidence necessary to prove such ownership and control at the relevant time, the necessary consequence is that his claim must fail for lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis.\"70*\n\nExh. RL-052, *Vito G. Gallo v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award, 15 September 2011, \u00a7\u00a7325-326, citing *Phoenix Action Limited v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award, 15 April 2009, \u00a768. See also *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17), Award, 9 January 2015, \u00a7182 (\"if a claimant acquires an investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred, the tribunal will normally lack jurisdiction *ratione temporis\").*\n\n327.\n\nAccordingly, this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is limited to measures that occurred after the Claimant became an \"investor\" holding an \"investment.\" These terms are defined in Article 1139 as follows:\n\n\"Investment of an investor of a Party means an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party;\n\nInvestor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment;\n\n[...]\"\n\n328.\n\nUnder this definition, an investor is not only someone who has made an investment; it is also someone who \"seeks to make\" an investment. On this basis, the Claimant contends that Chapter 11 extended to Mesa before the actual incorporation of its investments in Canada in November 2009 (for TTD and Arran) and April 2010 (for North Bruce and Summerhill).71\n\nC-PHB \u00a7355.\n\n329.\n\nBefore it addresses the merits of this argument, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant\u2019s allegations as to the precise time at which it sought to make its investments in Canada lack clarity. For instance, in its submissions prior to the hearing, the Claimant contended that it sought to make and actually made its investments at the same time (i.e. at the time of incorporation of its project companies in November 2009 and May 2010), without distinguishing between the two.72 in the same brief, it also submitted that it was first affected by the Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts in September 2009 when it was seeking to make its Investments in Ontario.73 Still in the same brief, it also referred to June 2009, when AWA LLC was formed.74 By contrast, in its post-hearing submission, the Claimant contended that Mesa made its Initial Investment in Canada by 14 August 2009, which is when the substantive protections of the NAFTA applied to it.75 For the present purposes, the Tribunal will assume that the Claimant was seeking to make its Investment in the TTD project as of 14 August 2009, and in the Arran project as of 14 September 2009. It chooses these dates because they appear in the latest submission of the Claimant and, more Importantly, because they are the only dates for which the Claimant has submitted some evidence.76 No cogent evidence has been submitted by the Claimant for the North Bruce and Summerhill projects. Therefore, for these projects, the relevant date is deemed to be the date of Incorporation, i.e. 6 April 2010.\n\nReply \u00a7826(a) (\"The Investor had been seeking to invest in Canada, and made an investment in Canada by incorporating its investments TTD Wind Project ULC and Arran Wind Project ULC in the Province of Alberta on November 17, 2009.\"); see also Reply \u00a7831 (\"[T]here are two dates that are relevant for events that first give rise to the claim - November 25, 2009 and May 29, 2010.\").\n\nReply \u00a7333(f)(i).\n\nReply \u00a7859 (\"Mesa\u2019s first investment in November 2009 was not a one-off investment. Mesa always intended to achieve several hundred megawatts of wind turbine projects in Canada from the time AWA LLC was formed with a view to establishing wind projects in June 2009.\").\n\nC-PHB \u00a7355 (\"Mesa made its initial investments in Canada by August 14, 2009. As testified by Cole Robertson, Mesa actually began looking to invest in Ontario in March 2009, and began due diligence and transaction work in July 2009. NAFTA\u2019s protection extends to Mesa in August 2009.\").\n\nExh. C-457 and Exh. C-461. By contrast, no evidence was submitted for the other dates supplied by the Claimant. For instance, in respect of the North Bruce and Summerhill projects, the Claimant submitted that it was seeking to make an investment before the FIT applications were made for these projects in May 2010 without providing any evidence in support. It also submitted that \"[t]he North Bruce and Summerhill projects w[e]re simply an expansion of the original Investment\" (Reply \u00a7859), also without furnishing any evidence in support.\n\n330.\n\nIt is obviously Implied in the definition quoted above that there must be a link between the Investor that seeks to make an Investment, and the Investment that the Investor seeks to make. Put differently, the Investor must establish that it was seeking to make the very Investment in respect of which it makes its claims. The Claimant\u2019s \"Investments\" in Canada consist of the four wind farm projects: TTD, Arran, North Bruce, and Summerhill. Therefore, to establish that it was an Investor in August or September 2009, the Claimant must show that it was seeking to make these four wind farm Investment projects in Canada.\n\n331.\n\nIn support of its allegation in respect of the TTD Project, the Claimant offers two documents - a \"Certificate of Correction\"77 and a \"Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement\"78, both of AWA TTD Development LLC and both dated 14 August 2009. According to the Claimant, under the latter Agreement, AWA TTD Development LLC was authorized to purchase \"the assets of [Twenty Two Degree Energy Corp]\"79. This is indeed so. However, AWA TTD Development LLC is a Delaware corporation (\u00a72) and the Tribunal is unable to establish the link between this asset purchase and the Claimant\u2019s TTD project which was incorporated in November 2009. The position is the same for the Arran project. Here too, the Claimant has not established how the evidence on which it relies shows that Mesa was \"seeking to make\" its investment in the Arran project in September 2009.\n\nExh. C-457.\n\nExh. C-461.\n\nC-PHB \u00a741.\n\n332.\n\nAs a result, and in the absence of other evidence, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Mesa has failed to establish that it was seeking to make its investments in Canada starting in August and September 2009. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the relevant date for the present analysis is the one on which each of the wind farm vehicles was incorporated. The Claimant also appears to recognise that the date of incorporation may be considered as the relevant date for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.80\n\nC-PHB \u00a7356 (\"Should the Tribunal nonetheless determine that Mesa\u2019s investments were made only in November 2009, when Mesa\u2019s project companies were incorporated in Canada\"). See also Reply \u00a7878(a)(iv)(a) and (b) (\"[Measures contrary to Article 1106(1)(b) and (c) of the NAFTA] first affected the Investor on November 25, 2009 when TTD Wind Project ULC and Arran Project ULC submitted their FIT applications which required Mesa to commit to an undertaking to adhere to all the FIT Rules, including the domestic content requirements [...] Mesa was again affected by this same measure when on May 29, 2010 North Bruce Project ULC and Summerhill Project ULC submitted their FIT applications\").\n\n333.\n\nTTD and Arran were incorporated on 17 November 2009.81 North Bruce and Summerhill were incorporated on 6 April 2010.82 Hence, for the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal concludes that its jurisdiction is limited to claims based on measures which occurred after 17 November 2009 for TTD and Arran and after 6 April 2010 for North Bruce and Summerhill.\n\nExhs. C-0087, C-0049.\n\nExhs. C-0050, C-0041.\n\n334.\n\nIt follows that, for TTD and Arran, the Tribunal cannot entertain claims based on the following measures:\n\na. Measures of the Government in respect of the FIT Program:\n\ni. The Electricity Act, 1998 as amended, in particular, Part 11.1 (Ontario Power Authority) and Part 11.2, (Management of Electricity Supply, Capacity and Demand), Including Section 25.35 (Feed-in Tariff Program);\n\nii. The GEGEA and the GEA;\n\nIII. The Ministerial direction of 24 September 2009 directing the OPA to establish the FIT Program and setting out the domestic content requirements to be Included in the FIT Program;\n\nb. Measures of the Government in respect of the GEIA:\n\niv. The conclusion of the MOU between the Ministry of Energy and the Korean Consortium on 12 December 2008;\n\nv. The alleged conclusion of a Framework Agreement between the Government and the Korean Consortium on 25 September 2009 (signed on 29 October 2009);\n\nvi. The Ministerial direction of 30 September 2009, which directed the OPA to set aside transmission capacity for members of the Korean Consortium;\n\nc. Measures of the OPA:\n\nvii. All version of the FIT Rules, in particular Rule 6.4(a)(1) of Version 1.1 of the FIT Rules, which required projects that became operational after 1 January 2012 to achieve 50% domestic content;\n\nviii. The FIT Contract, in particular, Section 2.4(b)(iii) and Annex D.\n\n335.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims concerning the GEGEA, GEA and the Ministerial direction of 24 September 2009 in which the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to include domestic content requirements in the FIT Program (i.e. the Claimant\u2019s Article 1106 claim).83 For completeness, however, the Tribunal notes that even if it had jurisdiction over this claim, the claim would, in any event, fail on the merits. As discussed in detail below, the Tribunal has found that the FIT Program constitutes government procurement. Consequently, Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) apply, and as a result an Article 1106(1)(b) claim is excluded.\n\nThe Claimant has identified these measures as being relevant for its Article 1106(1) claim. See C-PHB \u00a7493 (\"The domestic content requirements that were imposed by Ontario caused harm to the Investor. The requirements were mandated by the *Green Energy and Green Economy Act* and the Minister\u2019s Direction establishing the FIT Program, and were detailed in Exhibit D to the FIT Contract.\").\n\n336.\n\nNeither does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to consider the Claimant\u2019s claims that the MOU of 12 December 2008 or the subsequent alleged Framework Agreement of 25 September 2009 breached Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105 of the NAFTA. However, as Ontario entered into the GEIA - which was the successor of the MOU and the alleged Framework Agreement - in January 2010 (i.e. after the Claimant\u2019s investment), the Tribunal does have jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims in respect of the GEIA. These claims are considered below (\u00a7\u00a7542 et. seq.).\n\n337.\n\nAs for North Bruce and Summerhill, which were incorporated later than the first two projects, namely on 6 April 2010, the claims in connection with the GEIA of 21 January 2010 are outside the temporal scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, in addition to the measures excluded in the preceding paragraphs.\n\n338.\n\nHaving so concluded, it is to be noted that while the measures just listed are beyond the reach of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the circumstances in which they occurred may be considered in so far as they provide background and context to the analysis of the claims over which the Tribunal does have jurisdiction. This is in particular relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the Claimant\u2019s Article 1105(1) claims which are considered below (\u00a7\u00a7467 et. seq.).\n\n**4. Attribution Objection**\n----------------------------\n\n339.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7254), the Respondent impugns acts of the Government of Ontario as well as of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO. The Respondent agrees that acts of the Government of Ontario are attributable to it.84 However, it disputes the attribution of acts of the OPA, IESO and Hydro One.\n\nTr. (31 October 2014) 159:18-22 (\"[Canada does] not dispute that the decisions taken by the Government of Ontario are attributable to the Government of Canada. Of course, the actions of subnational governments are attributable under the NAFTA.\").\n\n340.\n\nBefore entering Into the analysis of attribution, there is an Initial question of characterisation. It is Canada\u2019s case that its objection goes to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. This, however, is not the Tribunal\u2019s view. While the distinction makes no relevant difference in this case where jurisdiction and merits are joined, on a proper analysis questions of attribution such as those that arise in this case concern the responsibility of a State party for the acts and omissions of others. Whether or not a State party is Indeed so responsible is ordinarily a matter concerning the State party\u2019s liability, and as such within a tribunal\u2019s competence to determine. It does not generally govern the competence of the tribunal to hear the case Itself. Further (and in any event) attribution is generally best dealt with at the merits stage. This is subject to a *prima facie pro tem* test being performed in the context of jurisdiction to ascertain that the acts alleged are susceptible of constituting treaty breaches, which test is met here. This was also the approach followed by the tribunals in *Jan de Nul85* and *Hamester.86* The latter tribunal held:\n\n\"[A]s a practical matter, [attribution] is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship between certain acts and the State.\"87\n\nExh. RL-057, *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13), Award, 6 November 2008 ***(Jan de Nul\").***\n\nExh.

In its Memorial, the Claimant argued that the OPA was an organ of Canada pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC Articles, and that it was a state enterprise under Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA.88 it also argued that Hydro One and IESO were \"state enterprises\" in accordance with the definition of the term in Annex 1505.89 in its Reply, however, it argued that the OPA\u2019s acts were attributable to Canada pursuant to Article 8 (not Article 490) of the ILC Articles, and that the OPA was not a state enterprise under Annex 1505 but under Article 201 of the NAFTA.91 At the hearing and in its submissions thereafter, the Claimant reiterated its Article 8 ILC argument.92 However, it also submitted that the OPA \"should [...] be properly regarded as an organ of Canada.\"93 in these circumstances, rather than focusing on the Parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal will proceed to examine the facts necessary to determine the status of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO irrespective of whether they have been pleaded in the context of Articles 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC Articles.\n\nMem. \u00a766 (\"The OPA is therefore, without doubt, an organ of the Government of Ontario in accordance with principles set out in Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\"); \u00a780 (\"To the extent that Canada is not responsible for the OPA under ILC Articles 8 and 4, Canada retains plenary responsibility to ensure adequate supervision and control of the OPA under Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA.\").\n\nMem. \u00a792 (\"As the IESO is a state enterprise pursuant to the definition in Annex 1505\"); \u00a7101 (\"Hydro One is a state enterprise pursuant to the definition in Annex 1505.\").\n\nMem. \u00a7863 (\"The Investor\u2019s Memorial detailed how Canada is responsible for the actions of the Ontario Power Authority. Canada has this responsibility because of Article 8 of the ILC Articles of State Responsibility.\").\n\nReply fn. 217 (\"[...] the OPA does not meet the Canadian-specific definition for a state enterprise in Annex 1505 for the purposes of Chapter Fifteen, but the Ontario Power Authority meets the definition of state enterprise for the purposes of the general Article 201 definition of state enterprise which is applicable in NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\").\n\nTr.

Canada* Award dated 14 May 2015 (the **\"Claimant\u2019s Submission on** ***Bilcon\")*** \u00a798.\n\n**a. Article 4 of the ILC Articles**\n------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nArticle 4 of the ILC Articles sets out the basic rule that the conduct of a State organ is an act of the State and is thus necessarily attributable to the State:\n\n\"Article 4 - Conduct of organs of a State\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\"\n\n343.\n\nIn its initial submissions, the Claimant took the position that the OPA was an \"organ\" under Article 4 ILC Articles.94 The Tribunal cannot agree with this characterization. As will be seen in greater detail below, the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are all corporations95 with independent legal personality. Section 25.3 of the Electricity Restructuring Act, the statute that created the OPA, specifically provides that the OPA is not a Crown agent for any purposes.96 The position is the same in respect of Hydro One and IESO.97\n\nMem. \u00a766.\n\nExh. C-0401, Electricity Act, s. 25.1(1), s. 4(1); Exh. R-143.\n\nExh. C-0401, Electricity Act, s. 25.3.\n\nExh. C-0401, Electricity Act, s. 6, s. 48(2).\n\n344.\n\nThere are no Ontario laws which define the organs of the Government of Ontario in the meaning of Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles. The Claimant relies, however, on a so-called \"All Agencies List\" in support of its contention that the OPA is an organ of the Government. That list does not support Mesa\u2019s position. The All Agencies List was drawn up by Ontario\u2019s Public Appointments Secretariat to provide Information to persons wishing to serve on a government agency or non-classified entity.98 it describes the OPA, Hydro One, and IESO as \"non-classlfled entitles\", i.e. as entitles that are not \"provincial government organization[s].\"99\n\nExhs. R-170, 171.\n\nExh. R-097.\n\n345.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal sees no basis for holding that the OPA, Hydro One and the IESO are organs of Canada under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\n\n346.\n\nThe fact that these entitles were characterised as \"public bodies\" by the World Trade Organization **(\"WTO\")** Panel100 and Appellate Body101 does not lead to a different conclusion. The WTO Panel and Appellate Body considered these entitles as \"public bodies\" within the meaning of Article 1.1(a)(1) of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (the **\"SCM Agreement\"),** which is a substantially different context and is thus of little assistance for present purposes. Confronted with the same argument about the characterization of Canada Post as a public body by a WTO Panel, the *UPS* tribunal emphasized the difference in the following terms:\n\n\"[T]he provisions of the GATT considered in that case do not distinguish, as chapters 11 and 15 of NAFTA plainly and carefully do, between organs of a State of a standard type (like the Canadian Post Office before 1981) and various other forms of State enterprises.\"102\n\nExh.

Article 5 of the ILC Articles**\n------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nArticle 5 of the ILC Articles provides that the acts of entities which are not organs but exercise governmental authority may be attributable to the State if they are carried out in that capacity:\n\n\"Article 5 - Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\"\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are all state enterprises. Therefore, so says Canada, Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA creates a **lex specialis** with respect to the attribution of the acts of these entities, which displaces Article 5 of the ILC Articles.103 To address this submission, the Tribunal will first determine whether the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are state enterprises ((i) below). It will then examine the Respondent\u2019s **lex specialis** argument ((ii) below),104 and will finally review whether the impugned conduct of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO is attributable to Canada ((iii) below).\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7292.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7364 (\"The provisions of NAFTA Chapter Fifteen create a *lex specialis* that excludes the application of ILC Article 5, as both rules govern the same situation.\").\n\n*i. Status of OPA, Hydro One and IESO*\n--------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nA \"state enterprise\" is defined in Article 201 of the NAFTA as follows:\n\n\"state enterprise means an enterprise that is owned, or controlled through ownership Interests, by a Party\"\n\n351.\n\nThe term is also defined in almost Identical terms in Article 1505:\n\n\"For purposes of this Chapter:\n\nstate enterprise means, except as set out in Annex 1505, an enterprise owned, or controlled through ownership Interests, by a Party.\"\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are not state enterprises for the purposes of Article 1505 because they do not meet the specific definition for a state enterprise set forth in Annex 1505. The Tribunal disagrees.\n\n353.\n\nBy its own terms, Annex 1505 applies only to Article 1503(3)105 and not to Article 1503(2)106:\n\n\"Annex 1505: Country-Specific Definitions of State Enterprises\n\nFor purposes of Article 1503(3), \u2018state enterprise\u2019:\n\n(a) with respect to Canada, means a Crown corporation within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act (Canada), a Crown corporation within the meaning of any comparable provincial law or equivalent entity that is Incorporated under other applicable provincial law; and\n\n[...]\"\n\nArticle 1503(3) provides: \"Each Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes accords non-discriminatory treatment in the sale of its goods or services to investments in the Party's territory of investors of another Party.\"\n\nArticle 1503(2) provides: \"Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative supervision or the application of other measures, that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Chapters Eleven (Investment) and Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges.\"\n\n354.\n\nThe terms of the Treaty are thus clear: Canada\u2019s country-specific definition in Annex 1505 does not apply to Article 1503(2). Rather, the definition of \"state enterprise\" that governs is the one set out in Article 1505, which is Identical to the definition in Article 201. Consequently, for the present purposes, a state enterprise is one which is \"owned, or controlled through ownership Interests, by a Party.\"\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Government of Ontario brought the OPA into existence through the Electricity Restructuring Act, 2004.107 Under this Act, the OPA was responsible for overall long-term system planning, \"activities in support of the goal of ensuring adequate, reliable and secure electricity supply\", and the promotion of the diversification of Ontario\u2019s electricity supply with a particular emphasis on renewable and clean energy.108 Operated on a not-for-profit basis, the OPA falls under the \"legislative responsibility\" of the Ministry of Energy.109 it receives and executes directives from the Minister of Energy.110 Further, the Minister appoints the members of the Board of Directors of the OPA who are responsible for managing the OPA\u2019s business and affairs.111 He or she may equally dismiss an individual from the Board.112 The Minister also has the sole power to approve the business plan of the OPA.113 in addition, he or she approves the draft by-laws prepared by the OPA.114 At any time, the Government of Ontario could decide to dissolve and liquidate the OPA. If the OPA is wound up, the remaining property following payment of all debts and liabilities would belong to the Government.115 All of these elements lead the Tribunal to conclude that the OPA is \"owned or controlled\" by Canada. Thus, the OPA is a state enterprise under Article 1505 and Article 201 of the NAFTA.\n\nExh. C-0401, Electricity Act, s.25.1.\n\nExh.

The Tribunal concludes that Hydro One and IESO meet the definition under Article 1505. The Ministry of Energy is the sole shareholder of Hydro One and is entitled to acquire, hold and dispose of Hydro One\u2019s assets and liabilities.117 Hydro One falls within the \"legislative responsibility\" of Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Energy118 and carries out directives of the Ministry.119 Similarly, the Ministry of Energy effectively owns and controls IESO, which is a non-share capital corporation.120 IESO also falls under the \"legislative responsibility\" of Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Energy.121 it operates under a Board of Directors appointed by the Minister of Energy122 and its yearly business plan is subject to approval by the Minister.123 it also submits reports to the Minister.124\n\nMem. \u00a792 (\"As the IESO is a state enterprise pursuant to the definition in Annex 1505\"); \u00a7101 (\"Hydro One is a state enterprise pursuant to the definition in Annex 1505.\").\n\nElectricity Act, 1998, s. 49(1) (Investor's Schedule of Exhibits at C-0401).\n\nExh.

C-0401, Electricity Act, 1998, s. 22(1).\n\n357.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are all state enterprises, the Tribunal now proceeds to review whether Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA replaces the ordinary rules of attribution found in Article 5 of the ILC Articles or, in other words, whether the former constitutes a *lex specialis* prevailing over the latter.\n\n*ii. Article 1503(2) and Article 5 of the ILC Articles*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that the ILC Articles are residual rules in the sense that they only come Into play where no special rules are applicable. This is borne out by Article 55 of the ILC Articles which bears the heading *\"lex specialis\"* in the following terms:\n\n\"Lex specialis\n\nThese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an Internationally wrongful act or the content or Implementation of the International responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of International law.\"\n\n359.\n\nArticle 1503(2) of the NAFTA, for its part, reads as follows:\n\n\"Article 1503: State Enterprises \"[...]\n\n2. Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative supervision or the application of other measures, that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not Inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Chapters Eleven (Investment) and Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges.\"\n\n360.\n\nArticle 1503(2) thus addresses situations in which the acts of a state enterprise are impugned. It provides that a NAFTA Party is responsible for the acts of a state enterprise in respect of Chapter 11 (and 14) only in cases where that state enterprise exercises regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority delegated to it by that NAFTA Party.\n\n361.\n\nIn other words, Chapters 11 and 15 of the NAFTA distinguish between the obligations of a NAFTA Party itself (specified in Chapter 11), and the obligations of a NAFTA Party in respect of its state enterprises (specified in Chapter 15). For the latter, a NAFTA Party must ensure that its enterprises do not act in a manner inconsistent with the obligations imposed on the NAFTA Party under Chapters 11 and 14 of the NAFTA (Article 1503(2)). it must also ensure that its enterprises accord non-discriminatory treatment in the sale of goods or services (Article 1503(3)). Thus, a NAFTA Party is not responsible for every act of its enterprises. Rather, its responsibility is circumscribed by Articles 1503(2) and 1503(3). Furthermore, Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA limits the jurisdiction of a Chapter 11 tribunal to consider claims of a breach of Section A of Chapter 11 or of Article 1503(2).\n\n362.\n\nThe NAFTA thus establishes a special regime which distinguishes between a NAFTA Party and its enterprises, specifies what control obligations the former has over the latter, and thus organises the NAFTA Party\u2019s responsibility for acts of its enterprises. This regime cannot be displaced by the ILC Articles, which, as mentioned above, are residual in nature. Indeed, if the ILC Articles were to apply, then the conduct of a state enterprise discriminating in the sale of its goods or services would be attributable to that NAFTA Party. This would mean that a NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal would have to consider such conduct, although Article 1116(1) restricts its jurisdiction to claims of breach of Article 1503(2). As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Article 1503(2) constitutes a *lex specialis* that excludes the application of Article 5 of the ILC Articles. The Claimant agrees with this position.125\n\nC-PHB \u00a7364 (\"The provisions of NAFTA Chapter Fifteen create a *lex specialis* that excludes the application of ILC Article 5, as both rules govern the same situation.\").\n\n363.\n\nThe tribunal in *UPS,* after a careful consideration of these provisions, reached the same conclusion:\n\n\"Chapter 15 provides for a *lex specialis* regime in relation to the attribution of acts of monopolies and state enterprises, to the content of the obligations and to the method of implementation. It follows that the customary International law rules reflected in article 4 of the ILC text do not apply in this case.\n\n[...]\n\nit will be recalled that UPS also contends, as an alternative to the argument based on the rules of customary International law reflected in article 4 of the ILC text, that the proposition reflected in its article 5 apply to make Canada directly responsible for actions of Canada Post.\n\n[...]\n\nWe again recall however that the proposition in article 5 of the ILC text (as in other provisions) has - a \u2018residual character\u2019 and does not apply to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an Internationally wrongful act or the content or Implementation of a State's International responsibility are governed by special rules of International law - the *lex specialis* principle (paragraph 55 above). For the reasons which we have just given [....], and in particular the careful structuring and drafting of chapters 11 and 15 [....], we find that this argument also falls, as a general proposition.\"126\n\n*UPS* \u00a7\u00a762-63.\n\n364.\n\nAs a consequence, the responsibility regime arising from Article 1503(2) prevails over the residual rules of Article 5 of the ILC Articles. The acts of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO will accordingly be attributable to Canada if these enterprises were exercising regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority as specified in Article 1503(2) when they carried out the acts in question.\n\n365.\n\nHaving concluded that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are state enterprises and that Article 1503(2) of the NAFTA governs attribution, the Tribunal can dispense with reviewing whether their acts are attributable to Canada pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC Articles.\n\n*iii. Conduct of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nIt follows from the preceding discussion that the Tribunal must now assess whether the Impugned acts of the OPA, Hydro One and IESO were carried out in the exercise of regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority. In the affirmative, these acts would be attributable to Canada.\n\n367.\n\nThe term \"governmental authority\" is not defined in the NAFTA. In the context of ILC Article 5, the tribunal in *Jan de Nul* held that \"governmental authority\" meant the use of \"prerogatives de puissance publique.\"127 As the reference to governmental authority appears in Article 1503(2) as well as in Article 5, it seems appropriate to rely on the meaning so circumscribed. Therefore, to decide whether OPA, Hydro One and IESO exercised governmental authority when performing the acts challenged by Mesa, the Tribunal must assess whether these entities exercised sovereign power, examples of which are provided in Article 1503(2) itself (the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges).\n\n*Jan de Nul* \u00a7170; *Hamester* \u00a7202 (\"[i]t is not enough for an act of a public entity to have been performed in the general fulfilment of some general interest, mission or purpose to qualify as an attributable act.\").\n\n368.\n\nAs mentioned above, the following acts of the OPA have been challenged:\n\ni. All versions of the FIT Rules in particular Rule 6.4(a)(i) of Version 1.1, which required projects that became operational after 1 January 2012 to achieve 50% domestic content;\n\nii. The FIT Contract, in particular Section 2.4(b)(iii) and Annex D;\n\niii. The alleged failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking and evaluation of applications;\n\niv. The decision taken in August 2010 not to run the ECT;\n\nv. The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT applicants, and the OPA\u2019s meetings with other FIT applicants which led to benefits not available to the Claimant being granted to these applicants;128\n\nvi. The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010;\n\nvii. The OPA\u2019s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program;\n\nviii. The OPA\u2019s decision on the information to be included \u00a1n the TAT tables;\n\nix. The OPA\u2019s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line;\n\nx. The award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011.\n\nReply \u00a7878(b)(iv).\n\n369.\n\nAs it held earlier, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Items (I) and (ii) (\u00a7334). Its review is consequently limited to the acts enumerated in Items (III) to (x).\n\n370.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that section 25.35(1) of the Electricity Act provides that \"the Minister may direct the OPA to develop a feed-in-tariff program [...] under such circumstances and conditions, in consideration of such factors and within such period as the Minister may require.\" Acting under this provision, on 24 September 2009, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to \"develop a feed-ln tariff (\u2018FIT\u2019) program.\"129 That same direction required the OPA to create rules that \"[p]roponents will have to comply with.\"130 it further specified that it was the Minister\u2019s \"expectation that the OPA will establish appropriate policies and procedures with respect to the administration of the Programs.\"131\n\nExh. C-0264.\n\nExh. C-0264.\n\nExh. C-0264.\n\n371.\n\nin these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that by preparing the FIT Rules and setting out the ranking and evaluation criteria for the applications to the FIT Program, the OPA was acting in the exercise of delegated governmental authority. Thus, the OPA\u2019s acts in ranking and evaluating the FIT Applications are attributable to Canada.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that the Electricity Act (as amended) empowered the OPA to perform the following tasks:\n\n\"[E]nter Into contracts relating to the procurement of electricity supply and capacity in or outside Ontario; [and]\n\nenter Into contracts relating to the procurement of electricity supply and capacity using alternative energy sources or renewable energy sources to assist the Government of Ontario in achieving goals in the development and use of alternative or renewable energy technology and resources;\"132\n\nExh. C-0401, Electricity Act, s.25.2(5).\n\n373.\n\nThe OPA\u2019s authority to enter into contracts is repeated in section 25.32(1)(a) of the Electricity Act (as amended), which reads as follows:\n\n\"25.32 (1) When the OPA considers it advisable, it shall enter into contracts in accordance with procurement processes approved under section 25.31 for the procurement of\n\n(a) electricity supply or capacity, including supply or capacity to be generated using alternative energy sources, renewable energy sources or both.\"133\n\nExh. C-0401, Electricity Act, s.25.32(1)(a).\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that although the OPA had the power to enter into contracts, the award of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011 was the result of events that had taken place prior to that date. Indeed, the award of contracts resulted from a combination of the OPA\u2019s evaluation and ranking process and the reduction of capacity because of the LTEP and the GEIA.\n\n375.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal believes that in carrying out the act listed at items (iii) to (x) above, the OPA was exercising delegated governmental authority.\n\n376.\n\nThe position is the same when it comes to the controversial acts of Hydro One and I ESO. However, for these entities, the Tribunal notes that the only acts challenged are that IESO was part of the \"Korean Consortium Working Group\" and that, in 2010 and 2011, IESO and Hydro One met with the Claimant\u2019s competitors to discuss a connection to a 500 kV transmission line.134 Mesa has not substantiated its allegations against these entities, nor has it sufficiently explained how the acts of these entities resulted in a breach of Article 1105(1). In any event, it appears that the Claimant no longer pursues claims concerning Hydro One and IESO, at least not in respect of Chapter 15 of the NAFTA.135 In these circumstances, the Tribunal will not further review the Claimant\u2019s allegations in respect of IESO and Hydro One.\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7234, 578, 633 and 671.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7874-875 (\"Since the full extent of the violations of the NAFTA have taken place by the actions of officials of the *Government of Ontario,* or through measures which occurred through the mandatory direction of such officials by the *Ontario Power Authority,* there is no need to maintain any further Chapter Fifteen claims against the other Ontario entities such as the IESO or Hydro One [...] Canada has full responsibility for these measures taken by officials of the *Government of Ontario* or by the *Ontario Power Authority under the* direction of Ontario (emphasis supplied)\").\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the OPA, Hydro One and IESO are state enterprises, and that the OPA\u2019s acts Identified in \u00a7368(iii) to (x) are attributable to Canada, since they were all done in the exercise of regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority. As a consequence, the Tribunal will examine below whether the OPA\u2019s conduct in the exercise of this authority was wrongful.\n\n**C.** Procurement Exception\n----------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the FIT Program is a procurement process designed by a NAFTA Party and Implemented by a state enterprise. The obligations established in Articles 1102, 1103 and 1106(1)(b) of the NAFTA do not apply to Mesa\u2019s Investment, because the FIT Program constitutes or Involves \"procurement\" under Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA. Article 1108 expressly preserves the NAFTA Parties\u2019 right to pursue policy objectives through procurement, even where they Impose performance requirements or amount to discriminatory treatment.\n\n379.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Chapter 11 does not define the term \"procurement\". The term has, however, been considered in *ADF v.* L/.S.136 and *UPS v. Canada,137* both of which adopted broad Interpretations. The WTO Panel and Appellate Body in *Canada -Renewable Energy138* also took an expansive approach. On this basis, the Respondent concludes:\n\n\"[T]he ordinary meaning of the term \u2018procurement\u2019, as it is used in Article 1108, covers all measures constituting or Involving the lease or purchase of goods or services for any purpose, regardless of whether the government ultimately paid the cost, and regardless of whether the government retained possession of the end product. Understood in accordance with this plain language Interpretation, the FIT Program constitutes procurement for the purposes of Article 1108.\"139\n\nADF \u00a7\u00a7160-174.\n\n*UPS* \u00a7\u00a7121 -136.\n\nPanel Report, \u00a77,131; Appellate Body Report, \u00a75.59.\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7314.\n\n380.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s invocation of the most favored-nation-clause in Article 1103 and the 2009 Canada-Czech Republic Foreign Investor Promotion and Protection Agreement **(\"Canada-Czech Republic FIPA\").** it submits that Article 1103 cannot be used to exclude Article 1108, when the very purpose of Article 1108 is to condition the application of Article 1103. It adds that Mesa has in any event not shown that the requirements of Article 1103 are fulfilled.\n\n381.\n\nThe Respondent also disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s argument that the requirements of GATT Article III and NAFTA Chapter 10 should be imported into Article 1108. None of these requirements apply in this case *inter alia* because:\n\ni. Article 1108(7) contains nothing more than the term \"procurement\", unrestricted in any way and unencumbered by any conditions. In particular, none of the additional elements contained in GATT Article III:8(a) are found in Article 1108(7);\n\nii. The NAFTA Parties expressly \"carved-out\" all procurement measures in Article 1108 because they wanted to negotiate separate obligations with respect to procurement. In Chapter 10, the NAFTA Parties specified the forms of procurement subject to obligations and the content of these obligations. Chapter 10 in no way modifies the exclusion created in Article 1108 for the purposes of Chapter 11;\n\niii. Article 1001(5) does not contain a general definition of procurement for all of the NAFTA Chapters. The exception found in Article 1108 for purposes of Chapter 11 applies irrespective of obligations which the NAFTA Parties may have undertaken with respect to procurement in Chapter 10. The importation of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108 was also implicitly rejected by the *ADF* and *UPS* tribunals.\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent further opposes the Claimant\u2019s submission that procurement in Article 1108 requires that the goods or services be procured for the benefit or use of the government. It notes that nothing in the text of Article 1108 requires that procurement be for government use or benefit. It also points out that governments frequently procure on behalf of the people they govern. In addition, if the element of benefit or use were part of the ordinary meaning of procurement, then Canada would not have had to explicitly mention it in the Government Procurement Agreement on which the Claimant itself relies.\n\n383.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent denies that procurement in Article 1108 requires that the government take possession of or title to the goods and services procured. Such a limitation is not in line with the ordinary meaning of the term; and it would render the Article 1108 preclusion Inapplicable to the procurement of services, which are not capable of being possessed or owned.\n\n384.\n\nFinally, the Respondent opposes the Claimant\u2019s submission that the measures Impugned by the Claimant are not linked to procurement under the FIT Program. It stresses that all the claims are based on the design and Implementation of the FIT Program, and the Claimant\u2019s failure to obtain a FIT Contract.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the procurement exception in Article 1108 derogates from key principles of the NAFTA and that the \"potential for abuse is great.\"140 As a consequence, the provision must be Interpreted restrictively \"in order to meet the Interpretative requirements specific to the NAFTA, and the definitive statements within NAFTA Itself of its object and purpose.\"141 it further argues that, as the party relying upon the exception, the Respondent must establish that the measures in question fit within the meaning of the exception.\n\nMem. \u00a7465.\n\nReply \u00a7192.\n\n386.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Tribunal should deny Canada\u2019s procurement defense because of the better treatment provided under the Canada-Czech FI PA and the Canada-Slovak Republic Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the **\"Slovak Treaty\").** While the Slovak Treaty Imposes Identical national and MFN treatment obligations as the NAFTA, it contains no procurement exception. Thus, an Investor under that treaty would receive more favorable treatment from Canada than an Investor under the NAFTA, who would be subject to the procurement exception.\n\n387.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to consider the Respondent\u2019s defense, the latter would in any event fail, so the Claimant submits, because Article 1108 does not apply to provincial governments under Article 1005(1) of the NAFTA.\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimant points out that Article 1108 does not define \"procurement\", while Article 1001(5) does. For the Claimant, it is logical that the drafters of the NAFTA presumed that the meaning of \"procurement\" would be internally consistent within the NAFTA, unless a contrary intention was expressed. Thus, in the absence of a definition in Chapter 11, the one found in Article 1001(5) should be used. What matters under that definition is that the government obtains goods and services for itself, not for others. This understanding conforms to the ordinary meaning of the term \"procurement\" in international economic law. Mesa also notes that, in its submissions before the tribunal in *UPS,* Canada itself argued that the absence of a definition of \"procurement\" meant that the Parties intended the term to be given its ordinary meaning throughout the NAFTA, subject to the exclusions in Article 1001(5). The tribunals in *ADF* and *UPS* also relied on Article 1001(5) to understand the context and meaning of the term \"procurement\" in Article 1108. In any event, Article 1112 provides that, in the event of an inconsistency between Chapter 11 and another Chapter, the provision in the other chapter should prevail. Thus, even if the meaning of \"procurement\" in Chapter 11 was inconsistent with the one found in Chapter 10, the Chapter 10 meaning must be given preference.142\n\nInvestor\u2019s Response to the 1128 Submissions of the Non-Disputing Parties dated 27 August 2014 **(\"Claimant\u2019s First Article 1128 Response\") \u00a7105.**\n\n389.\n\nFurther, by operation of Article 1131(1) and Article 33(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal should take into account international law as well as applicable usages of trade. in the Claimant\u2019s opinion, recourse should thus be made to the meaning of procurement in international economic law, such as in the GATT Article lll:8(a) and the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement **(\"GPA\").** in Canada's General Notes to Appendix 1 of the GPA, Canada defines procurement as \"contractual transactions to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the government\". On this basis, the Claimant insists that there is only one meaning of \"procurement\"; \"procurement\" simply does not apply to products purchased to be resold to customers.\n\n390.\n\nFinally, the Claimant asserts that \"the FIT cannot constitute government procurement [...] because the ratepayers paid for all the electricity generated\"143 and that \"Ontario designed the program [such that] it could never be a governmental procurement because the government doesn\u2019t pay.\"144 For the Claimant, the transaction that takes place under a FIT Contract is \"akin to a markets based settlement and financial transaction\",145 and not procurement. It notes that while the OPA executes a contract which purports to purchase renewable power from generators, it does not acquire title, possession or control of the electricity produced.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7378.\n\nTr. (26 October 2014) 87:15-22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Article 1128 Response \u00a798.\n\n391.\n\nEven if Canada could establish that the OPA\u2019s activity constitutes procurement, its defense would still fall, because Canada had not established any connection between the disputed measures and the procurement of electricity. In other words, \"[t]here is simply no link between the discriminatory treatment in question and the purposes of the \u2018procurement\u2019 of electricity. Indeed, the effect of the discriminatory treatment is to make the supply of renewable generated electricity to Ontario consumers less efficient and more expensive.\"146\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Article 1128 Response \u00a7111.\n\n**3. The Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nMexico disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s contention that the provisions of Article 1103 and the Canada-Czech FI PA can be relied upon to exclude the application of Article 1108 of the NAFTA. It considers that \"Article 1103 applies to actual Instances of treatment [...] The fact that another treaty theoretically offers different treatment is Insufficient to establish a violation of Article 1103.\"\n\n393.\n\nMexico further states that the ordinary meaning of the term \"procurement\" in Article 1108 is broad and should not be limited by Article 1001(5). The definition of \"procurement\" in Article 1001 only applies in the context of Chapter 10 of the NAFTA; it was not Intended to have effects in the framework of other chapters such as Chapter 11. Finally, it notes that there are Important differences in language between the wording of GATT Article III:8(a) and NAFTA Article 1108.\n\n394.\n\nFor the U.S., while the term \"procurement\" is not defined in the NAFTA, its ordinary meaning \"encompasses any and all forms of procurement by a NAFTA Party.\" This is confirmed by the French and Spanish versions of the NAFTA, which use the generic term for \"purchases\" in those languages. Further, the United States agrees with the Respondent that Chapter 11 uses the term as a broad \"carve-out\", whereas Chapter 10 refers to it as a \"carve-in\".\n\n**4. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n395.\n\nArticles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA provide as follows:\n\n\"7. Articles 1102, 1103 and 1107 do not apply to:\n\n(a) Procurement by a Party or a State enterprise; [...]\n\n8. The provisions of:\n\n[...]\n\nArticle 1106(1)(b) [...] do not apply to procurement by a Party or a State enterprise;\n\n[...]\"\n\n396.\n\nAccordingly, if the FIT Program constitutes procurement by a Party or a State enterprise, a number of guarantees invoked by Mesa would not apply, specifically Articles 1102 (national treatment), 1103 (most favored nation treatment), and 1106(1)(b) (domestic content).147\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s \"nexus\" argument is addressed below (\u00a7459).\n\n397.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above (\u00a7\u00a7324 et. seq.), the Tribunal considers that it lacks jurisdiction over the domestic content claims. Thus, it will not further analyze these claims and will not consider the Respondent\u2019s arguments according to which Article 1108(8)(b) excludes the domestic content claims.\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal does, however, have jurisdiction over the MFN and NT claims. It will therefore consider Canada\u2019s position that it cannot entertain these claims as a result of Article 1108(7)(a).\n\n399.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Claimant\u2019s argument that the MFN provision (Article 1103), read together with the Canada-Czech FIPA or the Slovak Treaty, precludes the application of Article 1108 of the NAFTA ((a) below). It will then review whether the FIT Program constitutes \"procurement\" ((b) below) by a Party or state enterprise ((c) below).\n\n**a. Whether Article 1103 precludes the application of Article 1108**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe Claimant submits that because neither the Canada-Czech FI PA nor the Slovak Treaty contains a procurement exemption like the one found in Article 1108(7)(a), Mesa can avoid the application of this exemption by relying on the MFN provision in Article 1103 of the NAFTA, which requires that the Claimant be treated no less favorably than a Czech or Slovak Investor. Put differently, relying on Article 1103 and the allegedly more favorable standards of protection in the Canada-Czech FI PA and the Slovak Treaty, the Claimant submits that Article 1108(7)(a) does not apply to Mesa. The Tribunal cannot accept this position.\n\n401.\n\nFor an MFN clause in a base treaty to allow the Importation of a more favorable standard of protection from a third party treaty, the applicability of the MFN clause in the base treaty must first be established. Put differently, one must first be *under the* treaty to claim *through* the treaty.148 Thus, the Claimant must first establish that the MFN provision of the base treaty applies. Then, relying on that provision, it may be able to Import a more favorable standard of protection from a third party treaty. Here, the base treaty is the NAFTA. Thus, the Claimant must first establish that the MFN provision, i.e. Article 1103 of the NAFTA, is applicable. As Article 1108(7)(a) expressly excludes the application of Article 1103 in cases of procurement by a Party or State enterprise, for the Claimant to establish that Article 1103 of the NAFTA applies, it must show that the FIT Program does not constitute procurement.\n\nSee Exh. CL-260, *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S. A.* v. *The Dominican Republic* (UNCITRAL), LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, \u00a741; Exh. CL-262, Vladimir *Berschader and Mo\u00efse Berschader v. The Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. 080/2004, Award, 21 April 2006, \u00a7188. See also *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3), Award, 4 October 2013, \u00a7145.\n\n402.\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the FIT Program does constitute procurement. Thus, by virtue of Article 1108(7)(a), the MFN provision enshrined in Article 1103 cannot apply. As a result, the Claimant cannot rely on that provision to Import the allegedly more favorable provisions of the Canada-Czech FIPA or of the Slovak Treaty.\n\n403.\n\nIf one were to follow Mesa\u2019s interpretation, an investor would be able to avoid the application of Article 1108(7)(a) by relying on Article 1103, although Article 1108(7)(a) expressly prohibits such use of Article 1103. This result would be contrary to the rule of *effet utile* in treaty interpretation.149\n\nExh. RL-111, *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa* v. *The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26), Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 December 2012, \u00a752 (\"Effectiveness of a treaty rule denotes the need to avoid an interpretation which leads to either an impossibility or absurdity or empties the provision of any legal effects.\").\n\n**b. The FIT Program constitutes \"procurement\"**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nArticle 1108 excludes the application of non-discrimination standards and performance requirements in the event of \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\". It contains, however, no definition of the term \"procurement\". Accordingly, it falls on the Tribunal to determine the meaning of this term, as part of the phrase \"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\".\n\n405.\n\nMesa suggests that Article 1108(7)(a) must be interpreted restrictively because it is an exception. The Tribunal does not consider that the mere characterization of a treaty term as an \"exception\" requires an interpretation different from other treaty terms. Indeed, whatever their characterization, all terms of a treaty are subject to the ordinary rules of treaty interpretation. This was also the conclusion of the tribunal in *Mobil v. Canada* which, in the specific context of Article 1108, disavowed any restrictive interpretation:\n\n\"[t]he task of ascertaining the meaning of a reservation, like the task of interpreting any other treaty text, involves understanding the intention of the NAFTA Parties, and it is to be achieved by following the customary rules of interpretation of public international law, as reflected in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.\"150\n\n*Mobil* \u00a7\u00a7251,254.\n\n406.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will determine the meaning of \"procurement\" by reference to the principles of treaty interpretation set out above (\u00a7\u00a7231 et. seq.). It will give the term \"procurement\" its ordinary meaning, in its context, in light of the object and purpose of the NAFTA.\n\n(i) Ordinary Meaning and Context\n--------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nIn its ordinary meaning, \"procure\" (whether or not by a state or a state enterprise) means \"to get; to gain; to come Into possession of.\"151 The French and Spanish texts of the NAFTA use the generic term for \"purchases\" in Article 1108.152\n\nWebster\u2019s online dictionary: at http://www.mernam-webster.com/dictionary/procure. See also: Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 2nd Edition, 1976 p. 1435, cited at ADF \u00a7161.\n\nArticle 1108(7) of the NAFTA (\"Les articles 1102, 1103 et 1107 ne s\u2019appliquent pas: a) aux achats effectu\u00e9s par une Partie...\"); (\"Los Articulos 1102, 1103 y 1107 no se aplican a: (a) las compras realizadas por una Parte...\"). Article 2206 of the NAFTA, entitled \"Authentic Texts\", provides that: \"[t]he English, French and Spanish texts of this Agreement are equally authentic.\"\n\n408.\n\nTwo NAFTA tribunals, *ADF* and *UPS* have considered the meaning of \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a). In *ADF,* the dispute arose out of the claim of a Canadian steel supplier participating as a sub-contractor in a highway construction project. The governmental entity responsible for the construction, the Virginia Department of Transportation, received federal funding to Implement the project. The use of federal funds triggered the application of the Buy America Act, a statute which favors domestic producers participating in government-funded projects. In reaching its conclusion that the procurement exception applied, the tribunal observed that the term \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA was to be understood broadly:\n\n\"in its ordinary or dictionary connotation, \u2018procurement\u2019 refers to the act of obtaining, as by effort, labor or purchase. To procure means to \u2018get; to gain; to come Into possession of\u2019. In the world of commerce and Industry, \u2018procurement\u2019 may be seen to refer ordinarily to the activity of obtaining by purchase goods, supplies, services and so forth. Thus, governmental procurement refers to the obtaining by purchase by a governmental agency or entity of title to or possession of, for Instance, goods, supplies, materials and machinery.\"153\n\nADF \u00a7161.\n\n409.\n\nin *UPS,* the Canadian customs service had entered Into a contract entitled \"Postal Imports Agreement\" (the \"PIA\") with Canada Post. Under the PIA, Canada Post was to render services Including the collection of customs duties and excise taxes from the addressees of postal parcels. Canadian Customs paid a fee to Canada Post in consideration for these services. The claimant UPS, a US Investor, alleged that it had received less favorable treatment than Canada Post under the PIA. Canada Invoked the procurement defense under Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA arguing that the national treatment provision did not apply to the PIA as it was a procurement contract. The tribunal upheld Canada\u2019s defense. It noted that under the PIA, Canadian Customs, a governmental entity, acquired a service from Canada Post. Relying on ADF,154 it concluded that \"the PIA is clearly a procurement contract under which Canada Post performs services for Customs for a fee.\"155\n\n*UPS* \u00a7131.\n\n*UPS* \u00a7135. Prof. Cass issued a dissenting opinion in this case. According to him, the PIA could not constitute procurement because (i) it was not regulated in ways comparable to government procurement (there was no formal \"agreement\" or tender or evaluation process); and (ii) the structure of the PIA was unlike ordinary procurement. As will be seen below, the Tribunal finds that the FIT Program satisfies these requirements as well.\n\n410.\n\nAll three NAFTA Parties appear to support the broad notion of procurement as advanced by the tribunals in *ADF* and *UPS.156*\n\nSee Submission of the United States of America dated 25 July 2014 **(\"U.S. Article 1128 Submission\")** \u00a7\u00a715-17; and Submission of Mexico Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 dated 25 July 2014 **(\"Mexico\u2019s First Article 1128 Submission\")** \u00a7\u00a78-10.\n\n411.\n\nThis broad notion is further buttressed by the WTO Panel and Appellate Body in their decisions on whether the FIT program involved government procurement in the context of Article 111:8(a) of the GATT. In *Canada-Renewable Energy,* both the Panel and the Appellate Body were *inter alia* called upon to determine whether the domestic content requirements of the FIT Program contravened Article lll:8(a) of the GATT.\n\n412.\n\nWhile most of its findings were made in the specific context of Article III :8(a) of the GATT (which, as the Tribunal observes later, is different to Article 1108 in material respects), the Panel nevertheless concluded that the ordinary meaning of procurement was broad:\n\n\"As the parties have explained, the ordinary meaning of the word \u2018procurement\u2019 includes \u2018[t]he action of obtaining something; an acquisition\u2019. Article III:8(a) refers to \u2018procurement by governmental agencies of products purchased\u2019. The ordinary meanings of the word \u2018purchase\u2019 advanced by the parties include \u2018to obtain; to gain possession of\u2019 and \u2018to acquire in exchange for payment in money or an equivalent; to buy\u2019 [...] in our view, to the extent that the ordinary meanings of both words refer to the action of \u2018obtaining\u2019 or \u2018acquiring\u2019 something, they support a conclusion that \u2018procurement\u2019 and \u2018purchase\u2019 should be given the same meaning.\"157\n\nPanel Report, \u00a77,131.\n\n413.\n\nOn appeal, the Appellate Body rejected the Panel\u2019s findings that \"purchase\" and \"procurement\" could be equated.158 Nevertheless, it too observed that \"procurement\" had a broad meaning, albeit one which was to be understood by reference to the *procedures* of procurement:\n\n\"The term \u2018procurement\u2019 may refer generally to \u2018[t]he action of obtaining something; acquisition\u2019, or it may refer more specifically to \u2018the action or process of obtaining equipment and supplies\u2019. In a more technical sense, procurement usually refers to *formal procedures used by governments to acquire goods or services.\"*\n\nAppellate Body Report \u00a75.59.\n\n414.\n\nThus, the Appellate Body emphasized that procurement must be achieved through formal government procedures. This formal nature of procurement is also emphasized in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement of 2014, which defines procurement as acquisition of goods or services159 and provides for a formal procurement process including tenders, assessment of qualifications, etc.\n\nArticle 2(j) (\"Procurement\" or \"public procurement\" means the acquisition of goods, construction or services by a procuring entity).\n\n415.\n\nThis notion of procurement - as a \"formal\" acquisition - is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the context in which the term is used. The context is constituted by the other relevant provisions of the NAFTA as well as by the general objectives of the NAFTA identified in Article 102 of the NAFTA.160\n\nADF \u00a7147.\n\n416.\n\nSeveral provisions of the NAFTA contain the term \"procurement\":\n\n\u2022 Article 1201 (2)(c) sets out the scope and coverage of Chapter 12 (Cross-Border Trade in Services) and is worded similarly to Article 1108(7)(a):\n\n\"Article 1201: Scope and Coverage [...]\n\n2. This Chapter does not apply to:\n\n[...]\n\nprocurement by a Party or a state enterprise\"\n\n\u2022 Article 1001 of the NAFTA provides in relevant part:\n\n\"Article 1001: Scope and Coverage\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to procurement:\n\n[...]\n\n5. Procurement includes procurement by such methods as purchase, lease or rental, with or without an option to buy. Procurement does not include:\n\n(a) non-contractual agreements or any form of government assistance, including cooperative agreements, grants, loans, equity Infusions, guarantees, fiscal Incentives, and government provision of goods and services to persons or state, provincial and regional governments; and\n\n(b) the acquisition of fiscal agency or depository services, liquidation and management services for regulated financial Institutions and sale and distribution services for government debt.\"\n\n\u2022 in Article 1502, the NAFTA Parties undertook obligations with respect to measures adopted or maintained by certain monopolies. Article 1502(4) contains an exception to those obligations for procurements in the following terms:\n\n\"Paragraph 3 does not apply to procurement by governmental agencies of goods or services for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods or the provision of services for commercial sale.\"\n\n417.\n\nThese provisions provide little guidance on the Interpretation of the term \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a). In its analysis, the Tribunal must look to the specific context in which the term \"procurement\" has been used and must be \"extremely careful not to Interpret expressions or concepts used in specific provisions in the light of the use of those or similar expressions in other contexts\".161 The term \"procurement\" appears in Chapter 3 (\"National Treatment and Market Access for Goods\"); Chapter 10 (\"Government Procurement\"); Chapter 12 (\"Cross-Border Trade in Services\"); and Chapter 15 (\"Competition Policy, Monopolies and State Enterprises\"). As is evident from the titles of these chapters, each chapter regulates a different area. Some of these chapters have been said to \"stand virtually alone\"162 in the NAFTA. Further, in Chapters 11.12 and 15, the term is used as a \"carve-out\", precluding the application of substantive provisions, while in Chapter 10 the term is used as a \"carve-in\", allowing for and regulating the application of substantive provisions. In other words, the term \"procurement\" is used in different contexts in the NAFTA, serving different functions and for different purposes163, and to regulate different subject areas. To the Tribunal, this means that the term must be interpreted differently depending on the chapter and the specific context in which it is used. Indeed, if this were not the case, then the term could have been included in Article 201 of the NAFTA, which defines terms for the purposes of the entire Agreement. Yet, Article 201 contains no definition of \"procurement.\" in these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that the other Chapters of NAFTA, aside from Chapter 11, provide only limited context and guidance to understand the meaning of the term in Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA.\n\nExh. RL-059, *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award, 31 March 2010, \u00a786.\n\n*ADF* \u00a7148 in the context of Chapter 15.\n\nThe relevance of this difference is explained in the context of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the Claimant\u2019s arguments on Article 1001(5) of the NAFTA.\n\n(ii) Object and Purpose\n-----------------------\n\n418.\n\nAfter the ordinary meaning and the context, the Tribunal then turns to object and purpose. The overall objects and purposes of the NAFTA are set out in its Article 102(1), and Article 102(2) provides that: \"[t]he Parties shall interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with applicable rules of international law\". These objects and purposes must obviously direct the Tribunal\u2019s enquiry, but they operate at a high level of generality, and Article 102(1) itself provides that the objectives of the Treaty are elaborated more specifically through its principles and rules. Hence, when considering the objects and purposes behind the specific term \"procurement\", the Tribunal must also focus on the objects and purposes of the particular provision in which the term appears. And for this, the Tribunal must consider the text of the provision itself (here Article 1108).164\n\nSee *ADF* \u00a7147 (\"The object and purpose of the parties to a treaty in agreeing upon any particular paragraph of that treaty are to be found, in the first instance, in the words in fact used by the parties in that paragraph. This is in line with Article 102(1)\").\n\n419.\n\nArticle 1108 is entitled \"Reservations and Exceptions.\" it excludes certain measures from the substantive protections of Chapter 11. Article 1108(7)(a) excludes the application of non-discrimination provisions (and performance requirements) to investments involving procurement. The Tribunal understands that through the exception carved out by Article 1108(7)(a), the NAFTA Contracting Parties sought to protect their ability to exercise nationality-based preferences in cases of procurement. As noted in *ADF,* the NAFTA Contracting Parties, like many other countries, maintain domestic preference policies when procuring goods and services:\n\n\"The Federal Government of Canada, for instance, provides heavy financial assistance to the provinces for highway construction and many of the provinces receiving this assistance enforce domestic preference regulations in their procurement. In Mexico, too, federal law prescribes preferences for Mexican goods and services in procurement by states wholly or partially funded by the federal Mexican Government. [...] domestic requirements for Government procurement are in place \u2018in most, if not all, countries\u2019.\"165\n\n*ADF* **\u00a794****.**\n\n420.\n\nIt appears reasonable that a State be free to procure goods or services in a manner that yields maximum benefits for the local economy. Government purchasing of goods and services is an extremely Important function, and procurement by way of formal purchasing procedures is frequently utilised as an Instrument of policy. To this end, Article 1108(7)(a) allows for preferential treatment of local suppliers, when a Party is engaged in formal purchasing of goods and services.\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in its view, it makes no difference to the analysis above whether one focuses upon the single word *\"procurement\u2019* or the phrase *\"procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\".* The words \"... *by a Party or a state enterprise\"* Identify the entitles Involved, but do not change the nature of the activity Itself - which in this context assumes a State Party or state enterprise in any event.\n\n(iii) Claimant\u2019s Arguments on Interpretation\n--------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nHaving thus set out the contours of the term \"procurement\" above, the Tribunal now proceeds to examine the Claimant\u2019s arguments on the Interpretation of the term.\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal should rely on the definition of procurement in Article 1001(5) when Interpreting the term procurement in Article 1108(7)(a). It submits that the FIT Program cannot constitute procurement because, through this Program, the government is not purchasing goods for its own use, but for commercial resale. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal does not share this view.\n\n424.\n\nFirst, Article 1108(7)(a) only contains the term \"procurement\", without any limitation or specification. As explained above, \"procurement\" is commonly understood to refer to a formal acquisition, without a requirement that the acquisition be for the government\u2019s own use. The term for procurement in the French and Spanish versions of Article 1108 *(\"achats\"* and *\"compras\"* respectively) confirm this broad notion.\n\n425.\n\nSecond, Article 1108(7)(a) does not refer to Article 1001(5). If the NAFTA Parties had Intended to Incorporate the limitations found in Article 1001(5) Into Article 1108(7)(a), they could easily have done so. Indeed, other provisions of Article 1108 contain express references to provisions of other chapters of the NAFTA.166\n\nArticle 1108(5) (\"Articles 1102 and 1103 do not apply to any measure that is an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations under Article 1703 (Intellectual Property National Treatment) as specifically provided for in that Article.\").\n\n426.\n\nIt is further evident that the limitations of Article 1001(5) should not be read into Article 1108(7)(a) when one considers the purposes and functions of these provisions. Article 1001(5) is a \"carve-in\" rule, in the sense that it identifies types of procurement to which the regime in Chapter 10 applies. The Chapter 10 regime does not apply to the types of procurement that are specifically excluded by sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1001(5) (for instance, non-contractual agreements, the acquisition of fiscal agency or depository services) - albeit these fall within the ordinary scope of \"procurement\" (and hence the need specifically to exclude them). Hence, Article 1001(5) is \"inclusive\".\n\n427.\n\nBy contrast, Article 1108(7)(a) is a \"carve-out\" rule. Its function is to exclude all procurement activities from the scope of some of the obligations of Chapter 11.\n\n428.\n\nin the absence of a reference to Article 1108(7)(a) in Article 1001(5), it does not appear correct to import the limitations of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a), given that these provisions serve very different purposes.\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimant points out that the tribunals in **ADF** and **UPS** referred to Article 1001(5) in their interpretation of Article 1108(7)(a). While this is true, the Tribunal notes that Article 1001(5) itself contains two parts. First, the chapeau provides an inclusive definition of procurement (\"procurement includes procurement by such methods as purchase, lease or rental, with or without an option to buy\"). Notably, it does not limit the meaning of procurement by requiring that procurement be for governmental use or otherwise. Then, sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) describe the activities that fall outside the scope of Chapter 10\u2019s obligations. In determining the ordinary meaning of procurement, the tribunal in ADF relied on the chapeau of Article 1001(5) and not on the limitations of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of that provision. Neither the **ADF** tribunal nor the **UPS** tribunal imported the sub-paragraphs of Article 1001(5) into Article 1108(7)(a) as a means of limiting the ordinary meaning of \"procurement.\"\n\n430.\n\nIn any event, despite their reference to Article 1001(5), on the facts, neither the ADF nor the *UPS* tribunal found that sole use by the government Itself - which is a requirement in Article 1001(5) (\"procurement does not Include [...] government provision of goods and services to persons\") - is an Implicit requirement in Article 1108(7)(a). In *ADF -* which the Claimant Itself recognises as concerning activity \"in the proper nature of procurement\"167 - the procurement related to a highway Interchange, which was obviously not for the government\u2019s (sole) use. In *UPS,* the services in question were ultimately for the benefit of the persons or companies Importing goods by mail rather than for the government.168 For all these reasons, the Tribunal cannot support the Claimant\u2019s arguments on Article 1001(5). The Non-Disputing Parties appear to concur with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions.169\n\nReply \u00a7248.\n\n*UPS* \u00a7132.\n\nMexico\u2019s First Article 1128 Submission \u00a78 (\"Mexico observes that the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018procurement\u2019 in Article 1108 is broad and should not be limited by Article 1001.5. The description of \u2018procurement\u2019 in [A]rticle 1001.5 is applicable for purposes of Chapter Ten as it is included in the provision that sets out the \u2018scope and coverage\u2019 of [C]hapter Ten. It does not apply to Chapter Eleven.\"); U.S. First Article 1128 Submission \u00a717 (\"The United States agrees with Canada that, whereas in Chapter Eleven the term is used as a broad \u2018carve-out\u2019, in Chapter Ten the term is used as a \u2018carve-in\u2019.\").\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimant next argues that procurement is a term of art. The Tribunal should therefore refer to the meaning of procurement in International economic law, such as in Article IIl:8(a) of the GATT and Article l:2 of the GPA to conclude that procurement in Article 1108(7)(a) cannot refer to procurement of products that are not for governmental use. Here too the Tribunal disagrees.\n\n432.\n\nArticle lll:8(a) of the GATT provides as follows:\n\n\"The provisions in this Article shall not apply to laws, regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies of products purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for commercial resale.\"\n\n433.\n\nAccordingly, Article lll:8(a) of the GATT contains the term \"procurement.\" However, unlike in Article 1108(7)(a) where the term is unqualified, in Article lll:8(a) the term is qualified.170 As noted above, if the NAFTA Parties had wished to Introduce the additional limitations of Article IIl:8(a) of the GATT into Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA, they could have done so. Indeed, they did do so in Article 1504(2), which replicates the language found in Article IIl:8(a) of the GATT. But they did not do so here in respect of Article 1108(7)(a), which leads the Tribunal to conclude that Article lll:8(a) of the GATT should not be used to interpret Article 1108(7)(a).\n\nThe Appellate Body noted that Article lll:8(a) contains several elements: (i) \"laws, regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies\"; (ii) the procurement of \"products\"; (iii) \"purchased for governmental purposes\"; and (iv) products purchased \"not for a commercial resale\" (Appellate Body Report \u00a7\u00a75.57-5.58). None of these elements are present in Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA. See also Mexico\u2019s First Article 1128 Submission \u00a710 (\"There are important differences in the language used in GATT Article lll:8(a) and NAFTA Article 1108. GATT Article lll:8 (a) makes reference to procurement *\u2018by governmental agencies of products purchased*  *for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for commercial sale\u2019*  *(emphasis added).* This language is not present in Article 1108, which only makes reference to *\u2018procurement by a Party or a state enterprise\u2019.\").*\n\n434.\n\nArticle 1:2 of the GPA speaks of procurement in the following terms:\n\n\"This Agreement applies to procurement by any contractual means, including through such methods as purchase or as lease, rental or hire purchase, with or without an option to buy, including any combination of products and services.\"\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its General Notes to Appendix I of the GPA (\"Canada\u2019s **Notes\"),** Canada defines procurement as \"contractual transactions to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the government.\" if - as the Claimant suggests - the ordinary meaning of \"procurement\" implied government use, there would have been no reason to specify this in Canada\u2019s Notes. The fact that Canada had to specifically limit procurement to government use speaks against the Claimant\u2019s arguments that procurement is a term of art implying governmental use.\n\n436.\n\nThe understanding that procurement does not ordinarily imply government use was also confirmed by the WTO Panel in the following terms:\n\n\"[A]rgument that \u2018procurement\u2019 implies \u2018governmental use, benefit, or consumption\u2019 does not sit well with the immediate context within which the term \u2018procurement\u2019 is used in Article lll:8(a) of the GATT 1994. [...] The notion of governmental use, benefit or consumption is not immediately apparent from the ordinary meanings of these terms.\"171\n\nPanel Report \u00a77,131.\n\n437.\n\nFurther still, if (as the Tribunal has concluded above) the object and purpose of the carve-out in Article 1108(7)(a) is to permit the NAFTA Contracting Parties to purchase goods or services in a manner that yields maximum benefits for the local economy, it would make no difference at all whether such goods or services, once purchased, are used solely by the Government, or by any other entity.\n\n438.\n\nOnce again, this is so even if one places special emphasis on the words in Article 1108(7) and (8): \"procurement *by a Party ora state enterprise.\"*\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that if the meaning of \"procurement\" in Chapter 11 is Inconsistent with the meaning of \"procurement\" in Chapter 10, then the Chapter 10 meaning should prevail. The Tribunal does not find an Inconsistency between the meaning of \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a) and the chapeau of Article 1001(5). Indeed, for the reasons mentioned above, this Tribunal (like the tribunals in *ADF* and *UPS)* has found that the chapeau of Article 1001(5) Informs the meaning of \"procurement\" in Article 1108(7)(a). In addition, subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1001(5) are not found in Article 1108(7)(a), and therefore, the question of Inconsistency cannot arise. What the Claimant is seeking is not a finding of Inconsistency between Articles 1001(5) and 1108(7)(a) but rather an Importation of the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1001(5) Into Article 1108(7)(a), for which there is no justification, as has already been expounded above.\n\n(iv) Nature of the FIT Program\n------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nHaving thus set the contours of procurement in Article 1108(7)(a), and having refuted the Claimant\u2019s related arguments, the Tribunal now proceeds to examine whether the FIT Program constitutes \"procurement.\"\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in 2009 the Government of Ontario enacted the GEGEA \"to build a green economy.\" As Ms. Lo (the then Assistant Deputy Minister of the Renewables and Energy Efficiency Division at the Ministry of Energy) testified, the GEGEA sought to address a number of policy objectives, Including promoting clean energy, attracting Investment, creating jobs in renewable energy, and providing support for aboriginal and rural communities. In line with these objectives, it authorized the Minister of Energy to direct the OPA to establish a FIT Program,172 which was described as a procurement program:\n\n\"(1) The Minister may direct the OPA to develop a feed-in tariff program that is designed to procure energy from renewable energy sources under such circumstances and conditions, in consideration of such factors and within such period as the Minister may require.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) in this section, \u2018feed-in tariff program\u2019 means a program for procurement, including a procurement process, providing standard program rules, standard contracts and standard pricing regarding classes of generation facilities differentiated by energy source or fuel type, generator capacity and the manner by which the generation facility is used, deployed, installed or located.\"\n\nThe power to issue directions enabled the Minister of Energy to direct the OPA in various areas including \"procurement solicitation\" relating to the \"procurement of electricity supply\", administrative matters and the establishment and administration of the FIT Program.\n\n442.\n\nOn 24 September 2009, the Minister issued the formal direction to the OPA to establish the FIT Program \"to procure energy from a wide range of renewable energy sources.\" The Program was a \"key element\" for purposes of meeting the objectives of the GEGEA and it was \"critical to Ontario\u2019s success in becoming a leading renewable energy jurisdiction.\" it was to \"introduce a simpler method to procure and develop generating capacity from renewable sources of energy\", reduce emissions, \"enable new green industries through new investment and job creation\" and \"provide incentives for investment in renewable energy technologies\". The direction instructed the OPA to enter into FIT Contracts, prescribed the methodology and process for establishing prices, the duration of FIT Contracts, restrictions on the land on which electricity production facilities could be built, and rules governing reporting and review.\n\n443.\n\nAs Ms. Lo and Mr. Duffy (Manager of Generation Procurement at the OPA) explained, it was necessary for the Government to step in and to create a specialized procurement process for renewable energy. By doing so, the Government not only attracted investors by somewhat mitigating the commercial risks associated with developing renewable energy, but also ensured that Ontario\u2019s renewable energy development would be sufficiently robust to meet its future energy needs.173\n\nRejoinder Witness Statement of Susan Lo dated 2 July 2014 **(\"Sue Lo WS II\")** \u00a719; Witness Statement of Richard Duffy dated 28 February 2014 **(\"Duffy WS I\") \u00a75.**\n\n444.\n\nThe FIT Program was then put into operation through the FIT Rules, which were the result of numerous consultations with stakeholders.174 The FIT Rules required generators to enter into FIT Contracts with the OPA. They also specified the form of such contracts.\n\nExh. R-169.\n\n445.\n\nThe OPA's power to enter into such contracts was set out in section 25.35(4) of the amended Electricity Act of 1998, allowing it to conclude \"contracts relating to the procurement of electricity supply and capacity using alternative energy sources or renewable energy sources to assist the Government of Ontario in achieving goals in the development and use of alternative or renewable energy technology and resources.\"175 When assessing bids and granting FIT Contracts, the OPA was governed by the Ontario Power Authority Procurement Process Regulations.176\n\nThis authority is repeated in Section 25.35(1)(a) of the Act (Exh. C-0401). Section 25.20(3) confirms the OPA\u2019s power to enter into \"contracts relating to the procurement of electricity.\"\n\nExh. C-0401.\n\n446.\n\nThe FIT Contract described the contractual relationship between the OPA and the electricity generators. It Included a cover page setting out the essentials of the project, general terms and conditions, annexes addressing various matters relating to each project, and an appendix setting out standard definitions. Essentially, the FIT Contract contained a detailed framework pursuant to which a generator provided renewable energy electricity and, in exchange, received a guaranteed price for 20 years.\n\n447.\n\nConsistent with its practice in other procurement programs, the OPA employed a \"fairness monitor\" to verify the fairness and transparency of the Implementation of the FIT Program.177\n\nDuffy WS I \u00a752.\n\n448.\n\nOn the basis of this description, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the FIT Program constitutes \"procurement.\" By way of the FIT Program, the Government of Ontario purchases electricity through the OPA for the use of and for the ultimate benefit of the people of Ontario. The FIT Program bears all the hallmarks of procurement that have been described above. It was Introduced to create a green economy and stimulate job creation. It was designed following extensive consultations with stakeholders, and launched by formal announcements of the Government. Applicants to the Program were rigorously screened through prescribed (and publicized) criteria in a competitive, open process to which any Interested person could apply.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the FIT Program as \"procurement\" is corroborated by the conclusions of the WTO Panel and Appellate Body. The Claimant Itself submits that these conclusions are \"highly relevant\"178 and that this Tribunal can rely upon the Panel and Appellate Body\u2019s findings of fact about the FIT Program.179\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to First Article 1128 Submission \u00a7\u00a7107, 114.\n\nReply \u00a7208.\n\n450.\n\nThe Panel - before whom considerable evidence on the FIT Program was placed and which, therefore, reviewed the Program in great detail - reached the same finding as this Tribunal, namely that the FIT Program constitutes \"procurement.\" However, because it also found that the procurement was undertaken \"with a view to commercial resale\", it held that the FIT Program was not covered by the terms of Article III:8(a).\n\n451.\n\nOn its part, the Appellate Body did not explicitly comment on whether the FIT Program constituted \"procurement\" under Article lll:8(a) of the GATT, but it too spoke of \"procurement\" of electricity by Ontario.180\n\nAppellate Body Report, \u00a75.79 (\"the product being procured is electricity\"); See also \u00a75.75 (\"The product purchased by the Government of Ontario under the FIT Programme and Contracts, however, is electricity\") and \u00a75.84.\n\n452.\n\nThe Claimant submits that through the FIT Program, the Government does not actually use its ability to procure because \"the electricity is not paid for [...] by government [but] by consumers\" with the OPA acting as a financial conduit, transferring funds to the generators.181 The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. Under the FIT Rules, the OPA is purchasing electricity.182 Under the FIT Contract too, the OPA purchases \"Electricity and Future Contract Related Products\" from the generator.183 Further, the funds for each OPA purchase of electricity will inevitably be derived from public sources (i.e. consumers). But whether such funds are first collected from consumers and then utilized, or utilized by requiring consumers to pay generators directly, can make no difference.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7381.\n\nExh. C-0260, s.1.2, FIT Program Rules, v.1.0 (\"[a]pplicants must [...] enter into a FIT Contract with the OPA pursuant to which the OPA will pay the Supplier for Electricity delivered from its generating facility\"); s.6.3(a) (\"[t]he OPA\u2019s payment obligations under the FIT Contract will be [...] to pay for Hourly Delivered Electricity at the Contract Price.\").\n\nC-0109, Ontario Power Authority, Feed-in Tariff Contract, Version 1.1 (30 September 2009), Article 3.3.\n\n453.\n\nFurther still, after a thorough review of the FIT Program, both the Panel and the Appellate Body concluded that the FIT Program involved the purchase of electricity.184 in fact, the Appellate Body specifically observed that the FIT Program involved the \"government purchase of goods\" rather than a \"transfer of funds.\"185\n\nPanel Report \u00a77,243; Appellate Body Report \u00a7\u00a75,124, 5,128, 5,132.\n\nAppellate Body Report \u00a7\u00a75,128 and 5,132.\n\n454.\n\nIt may be noted that the tribunal in *UPS* dismissed the argument that the fee in question had to be paid in accordance with a specific formula or in a particular manner and concluded that a service had been procured despite the fact that the service was paid by the persons Importing goods rather than by the government.186\n\n*UPS* \u00a7\u00a7132-134.\n\n455.\n\nAnother argument advanced by the Claimant is that the FIT Program cannot constitute procurement because the OPA \"does not take any form of possession over electricity supplied by FIT generators, Including legal title.\"187 Here again, the Tribunal cannot accept this submission. First, unlike other goods, electricity, once generated, must be simultaneously transmitted and consumed. It cannot be stored in a warehouse or elsewhere.188 The notion of \"possession\" is not therefore an obvious criterion here. Indeed, in this context, the Tribunal notes that the procurement exception in Article 1108(7)(a) applies to the procurement of both \"goods\" and \"services.\" if possession were an Indispensable characteristic of procurement, this would mean that Article 1108(7)(a) would never apply to the procurement of services, because services are Incapable of being possessed. The Claimant\u2019s Interpretation would therefore render Article 1108(7)(a) unworkable in respect of the procurement of services, a result that would be prohibited by treaty Interpretation rules. The Tribunal thus rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that possession is a necessary attribute of procurement in the context of Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA.\n\nReply \u00a7209.\n\nWitness Statement of Rick Jennings dated 28 February 2014 **(\"Jennings WS** I\") \u00a75.\n\n456.\n\nFinally, both the WTO Panel and Appellate Body observed that Ontario does in fact take a form of possession over the electricity generated. Or, in the words of the Panel:\n\n\"[t]he fact that Hydro One owns and operates 97% of the transmission lines combined with the fact that it distributes electricity to 1.3 million customers, strongly suggests that the Government of Ontario purchases the electricity that is delivered Into the grid under the FIT Programme. In this regard, it is also Important to recall that while the IESO (another \u2018agent\u2019 of the Government of Ontario) has stated that it does not take any \u2018title\u2019 to the electricity in the Ontario power grid, it nevertheless controls how electricity flows through that grid. Thus, the Government of Ontario not only contracts with FIT Programme generators through the OPA to supply electricity into the grid, but it also directs the movement of that electricity to and throughout that grid by means of IESO instructions, and then finally, through the operations of Hydro One, transmits and distributes the delivered electricity to end-user customers. In our view, the combined actions of all three \u2018public bodies\u2019 (but especially Hydro One and the OPA) demonstrate that the Government of Ontario purchases electricity within the meaning of Article 1.1 (a)(1)(iii) of the SCM Agreement.\"189\n\nPanel Report \u00a77,239.\n\n457.\n\nOn its part, the Appellate Body also held that:\n\n\"[t]he Government of Ontario takes possession over electricity and therefore purchases electricity.\"190\n\nAppellate Body Report \u00a7\u00a75,127-5.128.\n\n458.\n\nThus, even if possession was a necessary requirement of procurement generally (on which the Tribunal expresses no opinion at present), and even if possession was a necessary requirement under Article 1108(7)(a) of NAFTA (which the Tribunal rejects), that requirement would be satisfied in the present case.\n\n459.\n\nThe final submission put forward by the Claimant is that Canada cannot rely on the procurement exception since it has not demonstrated that there is a \"nexus\" between the FIT Contract and the measures challenged by the Claimant under Articles 1102 and 1103 of the NAFTA.191 The Tribunal does not accept this submission. First, the Claimant\u2019s view appears to arise from arguments put before the WTO Panel and Appellate Body in the context of Article III:8(a) of the GATT, which, as mentioned earlier, is of limited use in the present analysis. There, the finding of a nexus between the good being procured and the good subject to domestic content was fundamental. The existence of a nexus is irrelevant here, because Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA is broader than Article lll:8(a) of the GATT. Once it is established that there has been \"procurement\" by a Party or state enterprise, Article 1108(7)(a) excludes all claims of NT, MFN and domestic content in connection with such procurement. Second, and in any event, as was already seen above (\u00a7254), the claims submitted to this Tribunal principally involve the acts of the Government and the OPA in relation to the FIT Program. In respect of Articles 1102 and 1103 of the NAFTA, the Claimant argues that Canada treated the Claimant and its investments (all of which were in the context of the FIT Program) less favorably than other investors in like circumstances. Thus, there is a direct nexus between the claims in this arbitration and the FIT Program. As a result, even if a nexus requirement similar to Article III:8(a) of the GATT existed in the context of Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA, it would be satisfied.\n\nThis argument appears principally in the context of the Claimant\u2019s Article 1106 claim (Reply \u00a7\u00a7204-205, 265), which, for the reasons mentioned above, has been rejected on jurisdictional grounds. As a result, it need not be considered further. However, to the extent the argument also relates to the Articles 1102 and 1103 claims, it is examined here.\n\n460.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the FIT Program constitutes a \"procurement\" within the meaning of Article 1108(7)(a).\n\n461.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, it remains for the Tribunal to address whether the FIT Program is a procurement program \"by a Party or a state enterprise.\"\n\n**c. The FIT Program is a procurement program \"by a Party or a state enterprise\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nThe exception in Article 1108(7)(a) only applies if the procurement is by a \"Party\" or a \"state enterprise.\" The Claimant argues that the FIT Program is not procurement by a Party or state enterprise because it is a provincial measure and Article 1001(1)(a) of the NAFTA \"excludes\" procurement by state and local governments. The Tribunal does not share this view. Indeed, the Claimant once again seeks to Import Into Article 1108(7)(a) limitations not found in that provision. For the reasons elaborated above, this approach is Ill-founded. Article 1108(7)(a) does not Include or otherwise refer to the limitations found in Article 1001(1)(a), and the Tribunal sees no reason to Incorporate such limitations contained in Chapter 10 Into Article 1108(7)(a) of Chapter 11.\n\n463.\n\nThe term \"Party\" is not defined in the NAFTA. However, as the obligations in Chapter 11 apply to both federal and provincial governments, it is coherent that exceptions to these obligations also apply to federal and provincial governments. Or, in the words of the *ADF* tribunal: \"the exclusionary effect of Article 1108(7)(a) and 8(b) operates on both federal and state governmental procurement.\"192 Applied to this case, this means that procurement through the FIT Program by the provincial Government of Ontario is to be considered as \"procurement by a Party\" for the purposes of Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA.\n\n*ADF* **\u00a7170****.**\n\n464.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal has already held earlier that the OPA is a state enterprise (\u00a7355).\n\n465.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal holds that the FIT Program constitutes procurement by the Government of Ontario under Article 1108(7)(a) of the NAFTA. The Program is implemented by the Government through the OPA, which is a state enterprise. Consequently, the acts of the Government of Ontario cannot be challenged under Articles 1102 or 1103 of the NAFTA. The claims in respect of these provisions are, therefore, dismissed. As a result of this finding, the Tribunal can dispense with enquiring into the Respondent\u2019s Subsidy Defense, which would only have been relevant in the absence of procurement.\n\n466.\n\nAs it held above, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the domestic content claims (\u00a7335). it will thus refrain from discussing whether such claims would be excluded by the operation of Article 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA, but to mention, for the sake of completeness, that its findings on Article 1108(7)(a) would equally apply to Article 1108(8)(b). Indeed, the Tribunal considers that the term \"procurement\" has the same meaning in Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b), and notes that none of the Parties (or Non-Disputing Parties) has argued to the contrary. Thus, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the domestic content claims *(quod non),* the latter would in any event not survive on the merits.\n\n**D.** Article **1105(1)**\n--------------------------\n\n467.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing analysis that only the Claimant\u2019s Article 1105(1) (referred to below as **\"Article 1105\")** claims remain to be resolved. The Tribunal will start by setting forth the principles governing the interpretation of Article 1105 of the NAFTA (1. below). it will then examine the scope and content of Article 1105 and address the Claimant\u2019s argument that Canada is bound to provide it with the allegedly more favorable treatment found in certain of Canada\u2019s other investment treaties (2. below). Finally, the Tribunal will determine whether the impugned acts of Canada violate Article 1105 (3. below).\n\n**1. Interpretation of Article 1105**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that on 31 July 2001, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission issued the FTC Note, which addressed *(inter alia)* Article 1105. However, it argues that the FTC Note is not the exclusive source of interpretation for Article 1105: \"the Tribunal should consider itself at liberty to interpret the meaning of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 as contained in NAFTA Article 1105 as an autonomous standard in accordance with all the normal and well-accepted sources of International law - not just customary International law.\"193 Further, the Claimant argues that the FTC Note is not a *bona fide* Interpretation of Article 1105 and amounts to an amendment of the NAFTA with the result that the FTC Note \"has no legal force or effect.\"194 Should the Tribunal consider Itself bound by the FTC Note, the Claimant stresses that such Instrument Itself states that it is merely one of the sources of Interpretation of the customary International law standard of treatment.195\n\nReply \u00a7596. See also \u00a7\u00a7543, 553, 572.\n\nReply \u00a7583. See also \u00a7572(b).\n\nReply \u00a7594.\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent considers that the FTC Note constitutes the only source of Interpretation for Article 1105. According to it, had the NAFTA Parties Intended that Article 1105 be Interpreted in accordance with the customary International law rules of treaty Interpretation, they would not have Issued the FTC Note. The fact that they did Issue the note \"leaves no space for the application of the customary International law rules of treaty Interpretation.\"196\n\nRej. \u00a7140.\n\n470.\n\nThe Respondent further opposes the Claimant\u2019s argument that the FTC Note is not binding on the Tribunal. It points to the wording of Article 1131(2), from which it is clear that the Tribunal cannot question the validity of the FTC Note. Moreover, it submits that the FTC Note would bind the Tribunal even in the absence of Article 1131 (2), as it merely emphasizes that Article 1105 prescribes the customary International law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, an Interpretation that the NAFTA Parties have always given to Article 1105.197\n\nRej. \u00a7\u00a7141-144.\n\n471.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the Claimant\u2019s position that the FTC Note Itself requires Article 1105 to be Interpreted in accordance with the rules of customary International law on treaty Interpretation. If the Claimant\u2019s argument were correct, \"it would lead to the absurd result that Article 1131(2) would require the Tribunal to apply only the FTC Note and not the customary International law rules of Interpretation, only to then have the FTC Note require the Tribunal to apply the customary international law rules of interpretation.\"198\n\nRej. \u00a7145.\n\n472.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that similar arguments were made by the claimant in the recent *Bilcon* case and that they were all rejected.\n\n**c. Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------------------\n\n473.\n\nMexico agrees with Canada\u2019s submission that the *Bilcon* tribunal correctly dismissed similar arguments with respect to the FTC Note.199\n\nSecond Submission of Mexico Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 dated 12 June 2015 **(\"Mexico\u2019s Second Article 1128 Submission\")** \u00a78.\n\n474.\n\nThe United States also agrees with the conclusions reached in *Bilcon* about the binding nature of the FTC Note. It is equally of the opinion that Chapter 11 tribunals may not turn to sources of international law beyond customary international law when interpreting and applying Article 1105.\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n475.\n\nArticle 1105(1) of the NAFTA reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\"\n\n476.\n\nThe FTC Note states in relevant part the following:\n\n\"2. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with International Law.\n\n1. Article 1105 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105.\"200\n\nExh. RL-063.\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tribunal is not limited by the FTC Note and may consider sources of law other than customary International law. The Tribunal finds it difficult to follow this view. Indeed, if the NAFTA Parties wished a Chapter 11 tribunal to Interpret Article 1105 in accordance with the usual rules of treaty Interpretation, there would have been no need for the FTC Note. The fact that the NAFTA Parties Issued the FTC Note establishes that the NAFTA Parties Intended Chapter 11 tribunals to Interpret Article 1105 in the manner prescribed in the FTC Note Itself. If one were to follow the Claimant\u2019s argument, the FTC Note would be Inutile, which cannot be correct.\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the FTC Note does not bind the Tribunal. Here too, the Tribunal cannot accept this position. Article 1131 of the NAFTA, which deals with the governing law, provides the contrary in no uncertain terms:\n\n\"2. An Interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.\"\n\n479.\n\nThus, pursuant to Article 1131(2), an Interpretation Issued by the Free Trade Commission under the NAFTA, such as the FTC Note, is binding on all Chapter 11 tribunals. It is not for this Tribunal to determine whether - as the Claimant alleges - the FTC Note amounts to an amendment of the NAFTA or not. Rather, faced with an Interpretation given by the Contracting States through the FTC, the Tribunal must simply apply it. This approach has been followed by several NAFTA tribunals.201 For Instance, the tribunal in *ADF* observed:\n\n\"Nothing in NAFTA suggests that a Chapter 11 tribunal may determine for Itself whether a document submitted to it as an Interpretation by the Parties acting through the FTC is in fact an \u2018amendment\u2019 which presumably may be disregarded until ratified by all the Parties under their respective Internal law.\"202\n\nSee for instance Exh. CL-022, *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America* (UNCITRAL), Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005, Part IV-Chapter C, \u00a720.\n\n*ADF* **\u00a7177****.**\n\n480.\n\nMore recently, the tribunal in *Bilcon* also held that the FTC Note constituted an \"authentic interpretation\" of the NAFTA, which it not only had to take into account under Article 31(3) VCLT, but which was binding upon it:\n\n\"Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties calls on treaty interpreters to take into account \u2018any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\u2019. Yet NAFTA Article 1131(2) contains a *lex specialis,* which goes further in providing that \u2018[a]n interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this Agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section\u2019. Under the general rule on interpretation set out in the Vienna Convention, a NAFTA tribunal would only need to \u2018take into account\u2019 the subsequent agreement. However, by virtue of NAFTA Article 1131(2), acts of authentic interpretation by the States parties to the Agreement, like the Notes just referred to, are binding and conclusive.\"203\n\nExh. CL-351, *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Government of Canada,* PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015 ***(\"Bilcon\"),*** \u00a7430.\n\n481.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the FTC Note itself calls for the Tribunal to apply the customary international law rules of treaty interpretation while interpreting Article 1105. in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this does not appear correct. The FTC Note does not contain rules for the interpretation of Article 1105. It actually interprets that provision by specifying its meaning according to which the standard of treatment in Article 1105 is identical to the minimum customary international law standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n482.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that, in determining the content of Article 1105, the Tribunal may refer to the sources of international law enumerated in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (the **\"ICJ Statute\"),** namely international conventions, international customs, general principles of law, judicial decisions and scholarly writings. Again, the FTC Note, which this Tribunal - like other tribunals before it - considers binding on it, requires the Tribunal to refer to customary international law, and not to other sources of international law. This is clear from the FTC Note itself and from case law in application of the Note.204 This said, while it cannot refer to other sources of international law, the Tribunal may certainly be guided by the decisions of other NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals applying Article 1105 and the FTC Note.205\n\nExh.

Scope and Content of Article 1105**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, Article 1105 obliges the Respondent to provide Investments of foreign Investors treatment that accords with the rules and principles established by the four sources of International law as enumerated in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute.206 it submits that the standard set out in Article 1105 at least Includes a requirement that Canada follow customary International law.207 For Mesa, Article 1105 consists of several components Including the duty to act in good faith; fairness and reasonableness; treatment free from arbitrary conduct; transparency; protection against abuse of rights; procedural fairness; legitimate expectations; treatment free from political motivation; and treatment free from discriminatory conduct. Further, the Claimant contends that the \"full protection and security\" requirement in Article 1105 \"requires a host country to exercise reasonable care to protect Investments against Injury by private parties.\"208\n\nMem. \u00a7331.\n\nMem. \u00a7336.\n\nMem. \u00a7413.\n\n485.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the minimum standard of treatment under customary International law has evolved and now converges with the fair and equitable treatment **(\"FET\")** standard found in modern Investment treaties that do not refer to the customary International law standard (to which the Tribunal will refer as **\"unqualified FET clauses\").** in effect, the Claimant submits that there are no material differences between the content of Article 1105 and that of unqualified FET provisions in other treaties.\n\n486.\n\nIn response to Canada\u2019s objection that the Claimant must establish state practice and *opinio juris* to substantiate the evolution of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, the Claimant states that \"the content of customary international law can be sourced through international tribunal decisions, and that it is not necessary to specifically prove the elements of state practice and *opinio juris.\"209*\n\nMem. \u00a7339.\n\n487.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that \"if a MFN clause in another treaty obliged Canada to provide treatment to investments of foreign investors that would be advantageous or surpassing the quality of that provided to investments under NAFTA Article 1105, then more favorable treatment would need to be provided by Canada [to the Claimant].\"210\n\nReply \u00a7540.\n\n**b. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent refutes the argument that Article 1105 creates an open-ended obligation to be defined by tribunals. It sets an objective standard of treatment, or in Canada\u2019s words, it \"prescribes no more and no less than the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\"211 According to the Respondent, the threshold for demonstrating a violation of Article 1105 is high. To breach Article 1105, the impugned state conduct must be \"sufficiently egregious and shocking, such as a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination or a manifest lack of reasons.\"212\n\nR-PHB \u00a765.\n\nR-PHB \u00a766.\n\n489.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the assertion that the autonomous standard of fair and equitable treatment and the international law minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105 have converged. Since the Claimant invokes a rule of customary international law under which the minimum standard equals FET, it has the burden of proving the existence of such a rule. And in this regard, it is for the Claimant to establish state practice and *opinio juris.* it must also prove that the Respondent has breached the customary rule. The Claimant has failed to discharge this burden. In fact, the Claimant has failed to cite a single award interpreting the customary international law minimum standard in a manner supporting its position.\n\n490.\n\nFinally, the Respondent opposes the use of the MFN provision to import standards found in other treaties. According to it, the FTC Note requires the Tribunal to Interpret Article 1105 as providing for the customary International law standard and nothing else. Provisions of other treaties as well as other clauses in the NAFTA, Including the MFN clause, are thus Irrelevant.213 in any event, for the Respondent, even if one were to look to its other treaties, the Claimant has not proven that any of those treaties provides for treatment more favorable than the minimum standard of Article 1105.\n\nRej. \u00a7152.\n\n**c. The Non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nIt is the United States\u2019 submission that the FTC Note confirms the NAFTA Parties\u2019 express Intent to establish the minimum standard of customary International law as the applicable standard for purposes of Article 1105. According to it, \"the minimum standard of treatment is an umbrella concept reflecting a set of rules that, over time, has crystallized Into customary International law in specific contexts\", with the result that Article 1105 \"reflects a standard that develops from State practice and *opinio juris,* rather than an autonomous, treaty-based standard.\"214\n\nU.S. First Article 1128 Submission \u00a76.\n\n492.\n\nIt further submits that the burden is on the Claimant to establish the existence, applicability, and violation of a relevant obligation under customary International law. This burden cannot be discharged by relying on arbitral decisions as these decisions do not constitute evidence of state practice and *opinio juris.*\n\n493.\n\nFinally, it notes that a finding of a breach of Article 1105 \"must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that International law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their borders.\"215\n\nU.S. First Article 1128 Submission \u00a79, citing *SD Myers.*\n\n494.\n\nIn its submission, Mexico contends that the threshold for a breach of Article 1105 is high. it concurs with the United States and Canada that the burden is on the Claimant to establish an obligation under customary International law based on state practice and *opinio juris.* it is also common ground among Mexico and the other NAFTA Parties that decisions of arbitral tribunals are not themselves a source of customary International law.\n\n**d. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n495.\n\nThe Parties diverge on the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment found in Article 1105. Mesa submits that such standard has evolved and now has the same content and meaning as the so-called \"autonomous\" FET standard of modern BITs, while the Respondent holds the contrary view.\n\n496.\n\nAn analysis of the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment usually starts with a reference to the U.S.-Mexico Claims Commission\u2019s decision in *Neer.* There the Claims Commission defined the standard in the following terms:\n\n\"[T]he treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"216\n\nExh. CL-141, *L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer (United States)* v. *Mexico,* UNRIAA Award, 15 October 1926, Vol. 4, pp. 61-62, \u00a74.\n\n497.\n\nA number of Chapter 11 tribunals have since set out the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105. Broadly, two lines of decisions can be discerned: decisions questioning the relevance and applicability of the Neer standard, and decisions applying it with a number of important qualifications.\n\n498.\n\nTribunals following the first approach217 emphasize that *Neer* did not deal with investment protection, but concerned Mexico\u2019s alleged failure to carry out an effective investigation of the killing of a US citizen by armed men who were not even alleged to be acting under Mexico\u2019s control or direction. According to the *Mondev* tribunal, due to this dissimilarity in circumstances, \"there is insufficient cause for assuming that provisions of bilateral investment treaties, and of NAFTA [...] are confined to the *Neer* standard of outrageous treatment [,..].\"218 Similarly, for the *ADF* tribunal \"there appea[ed] no logical necessity and no concordant state practice to support the view that the Neer formulation is automatically extendible to the contemporary context of foreign Investors and their Investments by a host or recipient State.\"219 More recently, the *Bilcon* tribunal noted that the NAFTA protection was not restricted to the /Veer requirement of outrageous conduct:\n\n\"NAFTA awards make it clear that the International minimum standard is not limited to conduct by host states that is outrageous. The contemporary minimum International standard Involves a more significant measure of protection.\"220\n\nExh. RL-059, *Merrill & Ring Forestry v.

Canada Itself does not rely on the **Neer** decision; it rather Invokes the articulation of the minimum standard as it was set out in *Glamis,223 Cargill224* and *Mobil.225*\n\n*Cargill* \u00a7284; Exh.

Most Importantly, they both accept that the minimum standard of treatment is an evolutionary notion,226 which offers greater protection to Investors than that contemplated in the /Veer decision.\n\n*Mondev* \u00a7115 *et. seq.:* ADF \u00a7179; Exh. CL-091, *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID No. ARB(AF)00/3), Award, 30 April 2004 ***(Waste Management),*** \u00a798; *Merrill & Ring* \u00a7\u00a792-193; *Bilcon* \u00a7\u00a7435-438. See also Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Interpretive Powers of the Free Trade Commission, Fifteen Years of NAFTA Chapter 11 Arbitration 175, 184 (2011) (\"Essentially, most tribunals have considered that the minimum standard of treatment is an evolutionary notion, which applies as it stands today and not at the time of the *Neer* decision in 1926 - requiring outrageous conduct.\").\n\n501.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 positions and the authorities cited by them, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the decision in Waste *Management II* correctly Identifies the content of the customary International law minimum standard of treatment found in Article 1105.\n\nThis decision was cited with approval in the Claimant\u2019s submissions.227 it was also quoted in the recent *Bilcon* decision,228 with which the Claimant agrees,229 in the following terms:\n\n\"The formulation of the \u2018general standard for Article 1105\u2019 by the Waste *Management* Tribunal is particularly influential, and a number of other tribunals have applied its formulation of the international minimum standard based on its reading of NAFTA authorities:\n\n\u2018[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\n\nEvidently the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\u2019\n\n443. While no single arbitral formulation can definitively and exhaustively capture the meaning of Article 1105, the Tribunal finds this quote from Waste **Management** to be a particularly apt one. Acts or omissions constituting a breach must be of a serious nature. The Waste **Management** formulation applies intensifying adjectives to certain items\u2014but by no means all of them\u2014in its list of categories of potentially nonconforming conduct. The formulation includes \u2018grossly\u2019 unfair, \u2018manifest\u2019 failure of natural justice and \u2018complete\u2019 lack of transparency.\n\n444. The list conveys that there is a high threshold for the conduct of a host state to rise to the level of a NAFTA Article 1105 breach, but that there is no requirement in all cases that the challenged conduct reaches the level of shocking or outrageous behaviour. The formulation also recognises the requirement for tribunals to be sensitive to the facts of each case, the potential relevance of reasonably relied-on representations by a host state, and a recognition that injustice in either procedures or outcomes can constitute a breach.\"230\n\nMem. \u00a7361.\n\nThe decision was also quoted in the cases relied on by the Respondent. See *Mobil* \u00a7141; *Cargill* \u00a7283.\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Submissions on **Bilcon** \u00a7\u00a746-50 (setting out the **Bilcon** tribunal\u2019s decision on Article 1105 and stating that \"[i]n this arbitration, the Investor made similar submissions [...] advocating for the standard ultimately adopted in *Bilcon.\").*\n\n*Bilcon* \u00a7\u00a7442-444.\n\n502.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal considers that the following components can be said to form part of Article 1105: arbitrariness; \"gross\" unfairness; discrimination; \"complete\" lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process; lack of due process \"leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\"; and \"manifest failure\" of natural justice in judicial proceedings.231 Further, the Tribunal shares the view held by a majority of NAFTA tribunals232 that the failure to respect an Investor's legitimate expectations in and of Itself does not constitute a breach of Article 1105, but is an element to take Into account when assessing whether other components of the standard are breached.\n\nin a recent case, while interpreting Article 10.5 of the U.S.-Oman Treaty, which is similar to Article 1105 of the NAFTA, the tribunal described the scope and content of the customary international law standard of treatment as \"a gross or flagrant disregard for the basic principles of fairness, consistency, even-handedness, due process, or natural justice expected by and of all States under customary international law. Such a standard requires more than that the Claimant point to some inconsistency or inadequacy in Oman\u2019s regulation of its internal affairs: a breach of the minimum standard requires a failure, wilful or otherwise egregious, to protect a foreign investor\u2019s basic rights and expectations. It will certainly not be the case that every minor misapplication of a State\u2019s laws or regulations will meet that high standard.\" See *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33), Award, 3 November 2015, \u00a7390.\n\nSee for instance *Waste Management* \u00a796; *Cargill* \u00a7296.\n\n503.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s submissions that the \"autonomous\" fair and equitable treatment provisions in other treaties Impose additional requirements on Canada beyond those deriving from the minimum standard. As was already discussed above, the FTC Note is clear that the Tribunal must apply the customary International law standard of the International minimum standard of treatment, and nothing else. There is thus no scope for autonomous standards to Impose additional requirements on the NAFTA Parties. This was the conclusion in *Bilcon* as well.233\n\n*Bilcon* \u00a7432 (\"in light of the FTC Notes and in the specific context of NAFTA Chapter Eleven in which this Tribunal operates, \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 cannot be regarded as \u2018autonomous\u2019 treaty norms that impose additional requirements above and beyond what the minimum standard requires.\"). The *Bilcon* tribunal referred to the discussion of the \"additive approach\" in *Pope & Talbot - Award on the Merits of Phase 2* \u00a7110 *et seq.*\n\n504.\n\nThe threshold for a breach of Article 1105 is also relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. The Claimant does not appear to dispute - and rightly so - that the threshold for Article 1105 is high. Indeed, the three NAFTA Parties concur on this Issue234 and other Chapter 11 tribunals have come to the same conclusion.235\n\nU.S. Second Article 1128 Submission \u00a720 (\"Accordingly, there is a high threshold for Article 1105 to apply\"); Mexico\u2019s Second Article 1128 Submission \u00a78 (\"[T]he threshold for establishing a breach of the minimum standard of treatment at customary international law is high.\"); Canada\u2019s Observations on the *Bilcon* \u00a715; C-Mem. \u00a7394-402; Rej. \u00a7146.\n\n*Bilcon* \u00a7441; Exh.

Or, in the words of the *Bilcon* tribunal:\n\n\"Even when state officials are acting in good faith there will sometimes be not only controversial judgments, but clear-cut mistakes in following procedures, gathering and stating facts and identifying the applicable substantive rules. State authorities are faced with competing demands on their administrative resources and there can be delays or limited time, attention and expertise brought to bear in dealing with issues. The imprudent exercise of discretion or even outright mistakes do not, as a rule, lead to a breach of the international minimum standard.\"236\n\n*Bilcon* \u00a7\u00a7437, 440. See also *SD Myers* \u00a7263; *International* *Thunderbird* \u00a7127 (A State \"has a wide discretion with respect to how it carries out such policies by regulation and administrative conduct.\"); Exh.

Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award, 2 August 2010 ***(\"Chemtura\"),*** \u00a7153 (recognizing, in the context of a review process evaluating the environmental and public health impacts of a pesticide, that \"it is not for the Tribunal to judge the correctness or adequacy of the scientific results\").\n\n506.\n\nBefore the Tribunal proceeds to a review of the acts that allegedly breached Article 1105, it must address the Claimant\u2019s argument that \"[t]he MFN obligation requires this Tribunal to provide treatment as favorable to the Investor as that provided to other investors who would receive treaty protection for their investments under other investment protection treaties negotiated by Canada.\"237 Mesa thus contends that it can avoid the limitations of Article 1105 by relying on the MFN provision in Article 1103(1) of the NAFTA and importing FET clauses from other treaties of Canada. It points to several treaties under which Canada provides foreign investors with a better \"autonomous\" level of protection238 and submits that it is entitled to the same protection.239\n\nReply \u00a7541.\n\nReply \u00a7544 relying on treaties entered into between Canada and Armenia, Barbados, Costa Rica, Croatia, Ecuador, Egypt, Lebanon, Philippines, Thailand, Trinidad & Tobago, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\nReply \u00a7548.\n\n507.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission. Indeed, the Claimant bases its argument on Article 1103 of the NAFTA. As mentioned above, Article 1108(7)(a) excludes the application of Article 1103 in cases of procurement. As the FIT Program constitutes procurement, the Claimant cannot rely on Article 1103 to introduce allegedly more favorable standards of treatment from other treaties.240\n\nThe ADF tribunal appears to have come to the same conclusion. See *ADF* \u00a7196 (\"Assuming, once more, for purposes of argument merely, that the U.S.-Albania and U.S.-Estonia treaties do provide for better treatment for Albanian and Estonian investors and their investments in the United States, than the treatment to which the Investor is entitled in the United States under NAFTA Article 1105(1), the Investor still has not thereby shown violation of Article 1103 by the Respondent. For in any event, the Respondent is entitled to the defense provided by NAFTA Article 1108(7)(a) which, as noted earlier in some detail, excludes the application of Article 1103 in a case (like the instant one) involving governmental procurement by a Party.\").\n\n**3. Canada\u2019s Alleged Breaches of Article 1105**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nIn the course of its various submissions, Mesa has argued that numerous acts contravene Article 1105.241 Indeed, as the Respondent observed, \"[t]he Claimant has alleged that virtually each and every aspect of the conduct of Ontario and the OPA in the design and Implementation of the FIT Program and the GEIA has violated Canada\u2019s obligations under Article 1105.\"242\n\nSee for instance Mem. \u00a7\u00a7485, 485(d) (\"Canada\u2019s process for awarding Power Purchase Agreements was unfair, unreasonable and arbitrary toward Mesa\"), \u00a7\u00a7685-686.\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7381.\n\n509.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over all of the acts allegedly in breach of Article 1105. Specifically, it lacks jurisdiction over the claim that Canada breached Article 1105 by entering Into the MOU;243 over the Claimant\u2019s objections to the specific terms of the MOU;244 and over Mesa\u2019s claims concerning the Initial reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium.245\n\nThe Tribunal does have jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims in respect of the GEIA for the TTD and Arran projects, these are considered below (\u00a7542).\n\nC-PHB \u00a733 (\"[u]nder the MOU, the parties were to conduct a feasibility study and if the feasibility study supported the deal going forward, then the parties were to enter a conditional agreement [...] [N]either of these things happened.\").\n\nC-PHB \u00a73(c) (\"The Korean Consortium did not have to meet any requirements of any kind with respect to its guaranteed priority access to the first 500 MW of transmission access\"). The OPA was directed to reserve this capacity on 30 September 2009, which is before the Claimant\u2019s investment in November 2009.\n\n510.\n\nMoreover, some acts which were mentioned in the Claimant\u2019s Initial submissions did not appear again, at the hearing or in the post-hearing submissions.246 While the Claimant mentioned these and other acts at some stages of the proceedings, it did not rely on them to raise a specific claim on the ground of Article 1105.247\n\nSee for instance NoA \u00a738-42 where the Claimant complains about \"Renewable Energy Approval Changes\" and \"Waiver of OPA Termination Rights.\"\n\nFor instance, the Claimant submits that \"[t]he GEIA also provided the Korean Consortium a higher price for units of wind energy, by way of an Economic Development Adder. This was not available to Mesa despite the fact that both of their products - units of wind energy in Ontario\u2019s transmission grid were identical and indistinguishable\" (Reply \u00a7122). However, it has not raised an Article 1105 claim on this ground. Further, the Claimant submits that \"Canada ignored the fundamental legal duty and responsibility of all public servants, who exercise either statutory or discretionary authority, to perform their duties fairly, reasonably, and in good faith [...] Ontario\u2019s representatives failed to comply with [these duties] when carrying out the renewable energy program\" (C-PHB \u00a73(d)), again without articulating a precise Article 1105 claim in this regard.\n\n511.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will focus now on the implementation of the FIT Program by the OPA (a); the GEIA (b); and the allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region (c). Before doing so, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that, in reaching the conclusion that Canada has not breached Article 1105, the Tribunal has reviewed the entire factual matrix surrounding the Claimant\u2019s investment, and every allegation that has been made at various times in these proceedings by the Claimant, not all of which are specifically addressed in this Award.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that in various instances the Claimant alleges that Canada\u2019s conduct was \"unfair\", \"arbitrary\", \"unexpected\", \"non-transparent\", \"unreasonable\", \"discriminatory\" and contrary to the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations. On the facts of this case, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to review whether each of these elements is within the scope of Article 1105. Neither does it appear necessary to set forth a specific test for each element. The following discussion of the evidence will demonstrate that the facts required for a finding of breach of Article 1105 have not been made out and the impugned conduct does not reach the high threshold needed to establish a violation of Article 1105. Thus, even if all of the components identified by the Claimant were to form part of Article 1105 (an issue which the Tribunal does not decide), there would still be no breach of Article 1105.\n\n**a. Implementation of the FIT Program by the OPA**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned above (\u00a7\u00a7350 et. seq.), the following acts of the OPA are to be considered by the Tribunal:\n\ni. The OPA\u2019s alleged failure to follow the FIT Rules with respect to the ranking and evaluation of FIT applications;\n\nii. The OPA\u2019s decision not to run the ECT;\n\niii. The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT applicants, and the OPA\u2019s meetings with other FIT applicants which led to benefits not available to the Claimants being granted to these applicants;\n\niv. The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010;\n\nv. The OPA\u2019s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program;\n\nvi. The OPA\u2019s decision on the information to be included in the TAT tables;\n\nvii. The OPA\u2019s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line; and,\n\nviii. The award of the FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011.\n\n514.\n\nEach of these acts is considered in greater detail below.\n\n(i) Ranking and Evaluation of the Claimant\u2019s Launch Period Applications\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it did not receive a FIT Contract because its TTD and Arran projects were evaluated and ranked in an unfair and arbitrary manner.248 According to the Claimant, the ranking was done without a careful review of the FIT Rules and the actual applications themselves.249\n\nMem. \u00a7806.\n\nReply \u00a729.\n\n516.\n\nThe Respondent replies that Mesa\u2019s allegations are baseless. It points to the fact that LEI, an independent agency, certified that the OPA had carried out a fair and consistent evaluation of the Launch Period Applications. Moreover, the rankings of the TTD and Arran projects were appropriate given the poor quality of the information supplied by the Claimant.250\n\nMem. \u00a7433.\n\n517.\n\nAs mentioned above, Claimant made two applications in the Launch Period for its TTD and Arran projects. In each application, the Claimant applied for three criteria points: Major Equipment Control Point, Prior Experience Point and Financial Capacity Point. According to the Claimant, it should have been awarded all three of these points, a position which is opposed by the Respondent. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent on this issue.\n\n518.\n\nBefore reviewing the Claimant\u2019s applications, the Tribunal makes three preliminary observations, which it will keep in mind while reviewing the merits of Mesa\u2019s claims.\n\n519.\n\nFirst, it is for the Claimant to establish that its applications were incorrectly ranked. This is particularly so in the present case where Mesa, as an applicant in the FIT Program, had the burden of providing the relevant Information to the OPA to enable it to evaluate the applications correctly.\n\n520.\n\nSecond, the Claimant presented Mr. Gary Timm as an Independent expert \"to [confirm] that the evaluation of Mesa\u2019s launch period Investments had been Improperly scored by the Ontario Power Authority.\"251 However, in his expert report, Mr. Timm did not conclude that the Claimant\u2019s applications had been Improperly ranked. Further, at the hearing, Mr. Timm fairly admitted that he had no comments with respect to the OPA's evaluation of the Major Equipment Control Point,252 and that he had not concluded that the Claimant should have been awarded the Prior Experience Point253 or the Financial Capacity Point.254 The Tribunal finds it significant that the Claimant\u2019s own expert has not supported the Claimant\u2019s position.\n\nReply \u00a730.\n\nTr. (29 October 2014) 114:16-23.\n\nTr. (29 October 2014) 116:15-117:8.\n\nTr. (29 October 2014) 115:9-116:14.\n\n521.\n\nThird, the Respondent offered the testimony of Mr. Richard Duffy, the then Manager of Generation Procurement at the OPA and the person responsible for the Launch Period ranking process at the time. Mr. Duffy submitted two witness statements in the arbitration, both of which explained in some detail why the Claimant\u2019s applications did not merit any criteria points. Despite the Respondent\u2019s Insistence, the Claimant chose not to examine Mr. Duffy at the hearing. Further, despite having the opportunity to do so in its submissions, at the hearing, and in its post-hearing brief, the Claimant did not expressly rebut Mr. Duffy\u2019s evidence on the shortcomings of the Claimant\u2019s applications. His testimony thus remains uncontroverted and the Tribunal sees no reason (nor has any reason been made out) not to rely on it.\n\n522.\n\nTo be awarded the Major Equipment Control Point, the Claimant would have to show that it had control over a major equipment component.255 To meet this requirement, the Claimant submitted a letter from General Electric **(\"GE\")** that stated that both projects had executed a fixed price contract with GE for the supply wind turbine generators.256 According to Mr. Duffy\u2019s evidence, this was insufficient under the FIT Rules:\n\n\"[T]he Claimant did not specify that the turbines complied or would comply with the domestic content rules of the FIT Program. [...] [E]ach application had to contain within the application materials submitted, all the supporting documentation and required information to support the Claimant's claims. GE makes turbines that are domestic content compliant and turbines that are not. There were no grounds for us to simply assume that the turbines that the Claimant had purchased from GE would meet the requirements of the FIT Program - especially since in other cases and for other proponents, GE had been very specific in committing to meet these requirements in a way that they had not done for the Claimant.\"257\n\nExh. R-003, FIT Rules Version 1.2, Section 13.4(a)(ii).\n\nExh. C-0129, Arran Wind Project FIT Application; Exh. C-0364, Twenty Two Degree Wind Project FIT Application.\n\nRejoinder Witness Statement of Richard Duffy dated 2 July 2014 **(\"Duffy WS II\")** \u00a77.\n\n523.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s applications also contained a statement that its equipment would comply with the FIT Rules. This statement was equally inadequate, as Mr. Duffy convincingly explained:\n\n\"For the Claimant to assert that merely acknowledging that it would comply with the FIT Rules should have been sufficient to obtain this point is, in my view, absurd. This would mean that every applicant that had submitted an application under the FIT Program would have complied with the requirements for this criterion point and if that was sufficient to be awarded this criteria point, there would have been no reason in having the point.\"258\n\nDuffy WS II \u00a76.\n\n524.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Robertson admitted that the Claimant\u2019s application for this criteria point was incomplete:\n\n\"Q. And [the FIT Rules] goes on to indicate that: \u2018To qualify for the criteria point, it must be demonstrated that the major equipment component will have undergone one of the designated activities set out in the applicable domestic content grid in Exhibit D to the FIT contract.\u2019 [As read] Correct?\n\nA. Okay, I read that, yes.\n\nQ. The letter does not indicate that the turbines will undergo the activities specified in Exhibit D of the FIT contract; correct?\n\nA. It does not. This was the letter that GE provided to us, based on their reading of the rules as well.\n\nQ. And Mesa did not supply a copy of the contract they had with GE; correct?\n\nA. We did not, no.\"259\n\nTr. (27 October 2014) 84:16-87:3.\n\n525.\n\nTo be awarded the Prior Experience Point, the Claimant had to show that it \"has, or any three full-time employees of [the Claimant] each have, successful experience with planning and developing one or more Similar Facilities.\"260 A \"Similar Facility\" was defined as \"an electricity generation facility, other than the Project, that is located anywhere in the world\".261 To qualify as a Similar Facility, a facility needed to meet certain specific criteria.\n\nExh. R-003, FIT Program Rules, v. 1.2, s. 13.4(a)(iii).\n\nExh. R-003, FIT Program Rules, v. 1.2, s. 13.1(1) (\"Similar Facility\" is defined as \"an electricity generation facility, other than the Project, that is located anywhere in the world, which (i) uses the same Renewable fuel as the Project, and (ii) has a Nameplate Capacity of at least 25% of the proposed Contract Capacity of the Project.\").\n\n526.\n\nIn its applications, the Claimant made general statements about its experience in energy projects. It did not Identify any facility which could be regarded as a \"Similar Facility\". Neither did the Claimant\u2019s applications name three full-time employees who had \"successful experience with planning and developing one or more Similar Facilities\" as required by the FIT Rules.262\n\nDuffy WS II \u00a7\u00a714-15. See also Tr. (27 October 2014) 12:11-14:3, 37:20-69:23, where Mr. Robertson testified that the Claimant had not fully complied with the FIT Rules in respect of this criteria point, and Reply \u00a7107, where the Claimant submits that Mr. Edey and Mr. Ward satisfied the \"Similar Facility\" requirements, but does not make a similar representation for Mr. Case.\n\n527.\n\nTo be awarded the Financial Capacity Point, the Claimant was required to provide audited financial statements and to show that a \"Designated Equity Provider\" (a person or group of persons holding an Interest in the Applicant) had a \"Tangible Net Worth\" of \"$500 or more per kW of proposed Contract Capacity at the end of the most recent fiscal year.\"263 The FIT Rules contained detailed definitions of who could be considered a \"Designated Equity Provider\" and how \"Tangible Net Worth\" was to be calculated.264\n\nExh. R-003, FIT Program Rules, v. 1.2, s. 13.4(a)(iv).\n\nExh. R-003, FIT Program Rules, v. 1.2, s. 13.1(e) and (m).\n\n528.\n\nIn its applications, the Claimant did not provide the required audited financial statements.265 Neither did it describe the calculations used to determine the Tangible Net Worth. As Mr. Duffy explained, this failure did not allow the OPA to assess the applicant\u2019s Tangible Net Worth:\n\n\"[The Claimant] equated its financial net worth with the alleged value of its turbine agreement with GE. However, there was no information on the aggregate book value of all of Mesa Power Group's assets or liabilities, nor any information on amounts with respect to the components listed in sub-section (c) of the definition of Tangible Net Worth. Without this information, we could not consider that an appropriate summary of the Tangible Net Worth calculation had been provided.\"266\n\nSee the testimony of Mr. Robertson, Tr. (27 October 2014) 69:24-84:15 (\"Q. So the FIT Rules required the audited financial statements for 2008, but Mesa was unable to provide those; correct? A. The time period between when the rules were released and when we had to submit applications did not provide sufficient time for us to get audited financials.\").\n\nDuffy WS II \u00a720.\n\n529.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tangible Net Worth could be \"derived from the information listed on page 52 of GE's 2008 audited financial statements\".267 in response, Mr. Duffy acknowledges that this is correct, but explains that it was not feasible in practice, which is the reason why the FIT Rules required summaries of the calculations:\n\n\"Of course it is true that a company's \u2018Tangible Net Worth\u2019, as defined in the FIT Rules, can be derived from its financial statements - that would be true of every application that we received in the FIT Program. However, the OPA's role was not to derive anything from the financial statements -if we had to do so for every application, we simply would have been unable to process them all. This is why the onus was on the applicants and that is why the FIT Rules clearly required applicants to attach a summary outlining and describing the calculation used to determine the Tangible Net Worth of Designated Equity.\"268\n\nReply \u00a7110.\n\nDuffy WS II \u00a721.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondent has thus furnished reasonable explanations as to why the Claimant\u2019s applications were not awarded the three criteria points. In these circumstances, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s complaint that its TTD and Arran projects were evaluated and ranked in an unfair and arbitrary manner.269\n\nThe Tribunal arrives at this conclusion without referring to the audit conducted by LEI, and therefore does not consider the Claimant\u2019s objections to the same.\n\n(ii) The OPA\u2019s decision not to run the ECT\n------------------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nThe Tribunal has described below (\u00a7\u00a7616 et. seq.) the circumstances in which and the reasons why the ECT was not carried out in August 2010. The Tribunal refers to that discussion. For the reasons set out there, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s submission that the OPA\u2019s decision not to run the ECT in August 2010 breached Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA.\n\n(iii) The allegedly better treatment offered by the OPA to other FIT applicants and the OPA\u2019s meetings with other FIT applicants which led to benefits not available to the Claimants being granted to these applicants\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the OPA treated other applicants better than itself, and met with these other applicants and granted them benefits which were not available to the Claimant.270 The Tribunal has addressed the Claimant\u2019s objections that particular FIT applicants received better treatment below (\u00a7\u00a7671 et. seq.).271 The Tribunal refers to that discussion and for the reasons mentioned there rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7412(d), 798(d), 878(b)(iv), 878(d)(iv).\n\nAlthough that section refers to acts of the Ministry, the Tribunal considers that its conclusions equally apply here.\n\n(iv) The release of the FIT Program rankings on 21 December 2010\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nOn 21 December 2010, the OPA published the priority rankings for applications that had not received a FIT Contract in the first round of FIT Contract offers. The Claimant alleges that these rankings were \"capricious and arbitrary\", but has given no reason to support this allegation.272 As a result, the Tribunal considers that this complaint is insufficiently pled and without any established foundation. Accordingly it dismisses it.\n\nReply \u00a7833(a).\n\n(v) The OPA\u2019s alleged misadministration of the FIT Program\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the OPA\u2019s refusal to disclose the scores for the Claimant\u2019s TTD and Arran wind projects, as well as the reasons for those scores, constitutes an \"arbitrary abuse of authority\" and violates \"Mesa\u2019s right to a fair, good faith and transparent process as protected by Article 1105\".273 it further alleges that the failure of the OPA (and the Ministry of Energy) to meet with the Claimant and explain the ranking also violates Article 1105.274\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7772-782.\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7783-792.\n\n535.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that the OPA\u2019s ranking of the Claimant\u2019s TTD and Arran projects complied with the FIT Rules. It is thus Irrelevant whether the OPA disclosed the details of the rankings to the Claimant, especially in circumstances where the Claimant does not allege to have suffered a loss as a result of the non-disclosure. In any event, the Tribunal notes that it is the OPA\u2019s usual practice not to disclose the results of a procurement process.275 Moreover, the Claimant has not established that the OPA gave access to the Information at stake to other applicants. For all these reasons, the Claimant\u2019s arguments cannot be accepted.\n\nWitness Statement of Shawn Cronkwright dated 28 February 2014 **(\"Cronkwright WS** I\") \u00a726.\n\n536.\n\nThe Claimant also complains that other projects were given higher rankings than its own, although they did not have better qualifications.276 This argument too can be dismissed for the reasons just mentioned.\n\nMem. \u00a7802.\n\n(vi) The OPA\u2019s decision on the Information to be Included in the TAT tables and (vii)The OPA\u2019s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the OPA\u2019s decision to Include certain Information in the TAT tables concerning connection point capability (specifically the L7S connection point) violated Article 1105.277 it also contends that the OPA granted special privileges to NextEra by allowing it to connect to the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line.278\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7765-776.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7661-674.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Claimant bears the burden of establishing a violation of Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA. It further recalls that these arguments were made in the Claimant\u2019s Reply and were fully addressed in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. Thereafter, the Claimant did not refute the substance of Canada\u2019s arguments, be it at the hearing, or in its post-hearing brief. The Respondent\u2019s arguments thus stand unrebutted.\n\n539.\n\nIn respect of the TAT Tables, the Respondent submits that the relevant Information was available to all FIT applicants, Including the Claimant. In addition, the Claimant could have approached the IESO for more Information, if it wished.279 With regard to the OPA\u2019s decision to offer NextEra a FIT Contract with connection points on the 500 kV Bruce to Longwood Line, the Respondent points out that the Claimant\u2019s own documents acknowledge that it was not prohibited from connecting to the 500 kV Line.280 As the Claimant has not submitted any cogent evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal cannot but dismiss the Claimant\u2019s arguments on these matters. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not alleged how it incurred any loss on account of these alleged breaches of Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA.\n\nRejoinder Witness Statement of Bob Chow dated 2 July 2014 **(\"Chow WS II\")** \u00a719.\n\nRej. \u00a7211 relying on Exh. R-181.\n\n(viii)The award of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe OPA awarded the third round of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011. None of the Claimant\u2019s projects received a FIT Contract. The 4 July award of FIT Contracts was largely the result of the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium and of the Bruce to Milton line allocation process. For the reasons mentioned in sub-section (b) and (c) below, neither of these events has been held to constitute a breach of Article 1105(1). it follows that the same outcome must prevail in connection with the award of FIT Contracts on 4 July 2011, which was effectively the result of these events. The Claimant\u2019s complaint must thus be dismissed.\n\n541.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mesa has challenged many actions, these acts are essentially steps in the implementation of Ontario policy and the Tribunal finds the policy unobjectionable. And where the challenged acts involve an allegation of collusion or unfair preference, there is simply insufficient evidence to establish the same.281\n\nThese findings equally apply to the Claimant\u2019s allegations concerning breaches of Canadian administrative law (Reply \u00a7680).\n\n**b. The GEIA**\n---------------\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimant contends that through the GEIA, Ontario unjustifiably gave the Korean Consortium preferential treatment at the expense of FIT Applicants including itself, who consequently invested in Ontario \"under false pretenses.\" Specifically, Mesa makes the following submission:\n\n\"The implementation of the GEIA was a breach of NAFTA Article 1105 that directly harmed the Investor. Ontario entered into an agreement that unfairly diminished the prospects for investors that were already participating in the renewable energy program, by blocking off capacity for the Korean Consortium that had originally been Intended for FIT applicants was unfair, and caused harm to Mesa [sic]. Further, Ontario failed to act with fairness and candor by providing Inaccurate and Incomplete Information about the GEIA to the public when it was signed. Ontario also failed to disclose key aspects of the GEIA which would be necessary for any of its competitors to fairly understand their position in the Ontario renewable energy market in comparison with the Korean Consortium.\"282\n\nC-PHB \u00a7473.\n\n543.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant contends that by entering Into the GEIA and providing better treatment to the Korean Consortium than to FIT Applicants (I. below);283 and falling to disclose the GEIA terms (ii. below),284 Ontario violated Article 1105. It further contends that the delay in running the ECT due to the Consortium285 also breached the GEIA (III. below). The Tribunal will examine each of these arguments in turn.\n\nReply \u00a7655; Mem. \u00a7776; and C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7404-408.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7655-660.\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7763-775.\n\n(i) Entering Into the GEIA and providing better treatment to the Korean Consortium\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position\n---------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Ontario entered Into the GEIA in 2010 although it knew that the FIT Program would be a success and that it would be sufficient to meet Ontario\u2019s renewable energy goals. By entering Into the GEIA in these circumstances when it was not bound to do so under the terms of the MOU with the Korean Consortium,286 the Respondent has breached Article 1105.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7298. See also Claimant\u2019s Submission on *Bilcon* \u00a799(d) (\"creating one competitive renewable energy program and then giving one proponent a significantly better deal to access contracts in that program is fundamentally unfair.\").\n\n545.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s further submission that the Respondent breached Article 1105, because it provided \"more favorable transmission treatment\"287 to the Investments under the GEIA than to those under the FIT Program.288 it notes that the members of the Korean Consortium are in the same circumstances as the FIT Applicants: a power purchase agreement under the GEIA is like a power purchase agreement under the FIT Program. Power purchase agreements under the GEIA had to meet the very same conditions Imposed under the FIT Program concerning minimum domestic content, land access, documentation, quarterly status reports, and waiver forms.289 in spite of this likeness, the Government conferred additional benefits on the Korean Consortium under the GEIA to the detriment of applicants under the FIT Program including the Claimant.\n\nMem. \u00a717(d).\n\nReply \u00a740.\n\nReply \u00a741.\n\n546.\n\nThe Claimant refutes the Respondent\u2019s contention that benefits were conferred on the Korean Consortium in exchange for extra investments in Ontario.290 For instance, so says Mesa, to be entitled to the Economic Development Adder **(\"EDA\"),** the Korean Consortium only had to designate a manufacturing partner, without having to actually engage in manufacturing.291\n\nReply \u00a7313.\n\nReply \u00a7313.\n\n547.\n\nOn a similar basis, the Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Korean Consortium was needed as an \"anchor tenant\". For Mesa, \"[t]he fact that the [GEIA] was kept a secret until the stakeholders already were preparing their FIT Applications contradicts the suggestion that the Korean consortium was needed as an \u2018anchor tenant\u2019\".292\n\nC-PHB \u00a770.\n\n548.\n\nFinally, the Claimant stresses that \"[f]rom the very beginning, the Korean Consortium\u2019s \u2018sweetheart deal\u2019 was attacked by the press, the Opposition Party, and even the Government\u2019s own party. The Cabinet did not want to (and did not) approve this deal, and the entire operation was later criticized by the Auditor General.\"293\n\nC-PHB \u00a76.\n\n(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n549.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"[t]here is nothing manifestly arbitrary, grossly unjust, egregious or shocking about a government entering into an investment agreement in which it accords certain advantages to a particular investor in exchange for certain investment commitments by that investor.\"294\n\nC-Mem. \u00a7406.\n\n550.\n\nIt notes that, at the time of the conclusion of the GEIA in January 2010, the OPA had received several applications, but that these were not \"good applications\", and that the FIT Program was at the risk of becoming a massive failure.295\n\nTr. (31 October 2014) 228:25-229:5.\n\n551.\n\nReplying to the Claimant\u2019s argument that better treatment was provided to the Korean Consortium over FIT Applicants, Canada argues that undertakings with respect to large-scale manufacturing and job creation were Imposed on the Korean Consortium through the GEIA, which justified such treatment. The Korean Consortium had agreed to Investments valued at CAD$ 7 billion, which distinguished it from FIT Applicants such as the Claimant.\n\n(c) Analysis\n------------\n\n552.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s submission under this head focuses on the decision by Ontario to enter Into the GEIA (which is said to have afforded the Korean Consortium preferential treatment). According to the Claimant, this decision, in and of Itself, breached Article 1105.\n\n553.\n\nIn reviewing this alleged breach, the Tribunal must bear in mind the deference which NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals owe a state when it comes to assessing how to regulate and manage its affairs. This deference notably applies to the decision to enter Into Investment agreements.296 As noted by the *S.D. Myers* tribunal, \"[w]hen Interpreting and applying the \u2018minimum standard\u2019, a Chapter Eleven tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making.\"297 The tribunal in *Bilcon,* a case which the Claimant has cited with approval, also held that \"[t]he Imprudent exercise of discretion or even outright mistakes do not, as a rule, lead to a breach of the International minimum standard.\"298\n\nThe Claimant agrees with this position. See C-PHB \u00a7201 (\"a tribunal\u2019s role is not to weigh the wisdom of the decision to enter an agreement, but to determine whether a government provided preferential treatment when it did so.\").\n\n*SD Myers,* \u00a7261.\n\n*Bilcon* \u00a7\u00a7437, 440. See also *SD Myers* \u00a7263; *International* *Thunderbird* \u00a7127 (a State \"has a wide discretion with respect to how it carries out such policies by regulation and administrative conduct.\")\n\n554.\n\nIn August 2008, Samsung approached the Government of Ontario for a special deal on renewable energy.299 The parties subsequently entered into negotiations, which culminated in the signing of the GEIA in January 2010.\n\nTr. (27 October 2014) 251:17-23; Rejoinder Witness Statement of Rick Jennings dated 2 July 2014 **(\"Jennings WS II\")** \u00a74.\n\n555.\n\nUnder the terms of the GEIA, the Korean Consortium was to develop 2,500 MW of renewable energy in Ontario and, importantly, to attract into the Province facilities for manufacturing wind and solar generation equipment and components.300 in exchange, the Korean Consortium was guaranteed priority access to 2,500 MW of transmission capacity in Ontario.301 The capacity was to be allocated in five phases over five years, each of approximately 500 MW.302 in consideration for its commitments, the Consortium was entitled to a price for its electricity that was higher than that of the FIT producers. This price would be an aggregate of (i) the price payable to renewable energy producers under the FIT Rules plus (ii) an additional EDA calculated in accordance with the terms of the GEIA.\n\nJennings WS II \u00a74.\n\nExh. C-0322, GEIA, ss. 3.1 and 3.2.\n\n*Id.*\n\n556.\n\nIt is critical to note, at the outset, that the arrangement encapsulated in the GEIA was not at all comparable with or equivalent to the FIT Program. Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s characterization, these were not two competing, interchangeable tracks. Unlike the FIT Program, the GEIA was designed to secure a major \"anchor\" operator in Ontario, in order to give momentum to its province-wide green energy initiative. But more importantly than this, the GEIA was concerned with local economic development, at a time of economic difficulty. The GEIA entailed a CAD$ 7 billion investment, and the creation of substantial manufacturing facilities over multiple phases; thousands of jobs in the renewable energy sector; and further indirect employment in finance and other service industries, as well as related manufacturing industries. As such, the generation of electricity from renewable sources was only one element of this initiative.\n\n557.\n\nPut another way, even if sufficient megawattage was achievable from the FIT participants alone, the other, broader objectives of the GEIA would remain and formed no part of the FIT Program.\n\n558.\n\nIt follows - again contrary to the Claimant\u2019s characterization - that the position of the Korean Consortium cannot be compared with the position of FIT Applicants. It was agreeing to a different set of undertakings, on a different scale. And hence, necessarily, the Korean Consortium secured an entitlement to different treatment. It follows that there is no basis to deem this difference in treatment discrimination, or the product of arbitrariness.\n\n559.\n\nThe fact that other entitles (such as Pattern Energy Group LP) could seek to work within the Korean Consortium project, Instead of proceeding alone with Individual FIT applications, is of no relevance. Any advantage they thereby achieved does not change the fundamental point that the GEIA (of which such entitles would form part) was a different project, which would necessarily proceed on different terms.\n\n560.\n\nFurther, there is no basis to conclude that the GEIA was designed to undermine the FIT Program, and nor would there have been any reason for so doing.\n\n561.\n\nThe reason for Ontario\u2019s entry Into the GEIA can be ascertained from the \"Backgrounder\"303 which was Issued by the Government at the time, and which reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n\"The agreement stems from opportunities created for developers and Investors through Ontario's Green Energy Act, and is expected to be among the first of many major Investments to result from the leadership position Ontario has taken in green energy.\n\n[The Korean Consortium] will be an anchor tenant in growing a new, vibrant green economy in Ontario. [...]\n\nThe agreement will lead to more than 16,000 green energy jobs over six years and bring $7 billion of renewable generation Investment to Ontario.\n\n[...]\n\nIn addition, the Increased renewable energy development and manufacturing activities will support Indirect job creation in areas such as finance, consulting and other manufacturing, service and development Industries. [...]\n\nThese manufacturing facilities will produce wind turbine towers, wind blades, solar Inverters and solar assembly in Ontario, creating more than 1,440 manufacturing and related jobs in the renewable energy Industry. [...]\n\nThe local availability of these manufactured components will also help other renewable energy developers meet the Feed-ln Tariff (FIT) domestic content requirements. An additional 700 manufacturing jobs are also anticipated to supply components not manufactured by the Consortium. [...]\n\nThe Consortium\u2019s renewable energy projects will deliver an estimated 110 million megawatt-hours of emissions-free electricity over the 25-year lifetime of the project. That's enough power to supply the electricity needs of all Ontario homes for nearly three years. Over the lifetime of these contracts, the wind and solar projects will displace 40 Megatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2, the leading greenhouse gas) compared to what would be emitted by equivalent gas-fired generation. [...]\n\nThe 2,500 MW of wind and solar power capacity to be built by the Consortium will triple Ontario\u2019s renewable wind and solar energy generation.\n\n[...]\n\nThe renewable energy projects committed to under this agreement will take advantage of the more than 20 transmission projects announced last fall.\n\nThe transmission projects will unlock significant opportunities for green energy projects across the province. [...]\n\nAll projects under the agreement would be subject to the Consortium entering into required agreements as well as obtaining required licences and approvals. [...]\n\nTo ensure value for Ontarians, the consortium and the government have agreed to market rate lease of government lands.\"\n\nExh. R-076.\n\n562.\n\nThe \"Backgrounder\" effectively followed up on an earlier announcement which Ontario had issued on 15 December 2009 and in which it justified its deal with the Korean Consortium as follows:\n\n\"What does this mean for Samsung? [...]\n\nWe are in discussions with Samsung which hopes to cultivate a green manufacturing sector in Ontario in light of our recently launched FIT program, which has generated significant interest.\n\nNegotiations are progressing and we\u2019re taking the time to ensure we get it right.\n\nThe Samsung proposal is about more than just renewable generation, it would help kick-start Ontario\u2019s green economy thr[o]u[gh] $7 billion in direct investment, create approximately 16,000 direct and indirect positions and cultivate manufacturing plants as well renewable generation.\n\n[...]\n\nHow can the government justify the Samsung when there are so many others willing to develop renewable energy without extra monetary incentives?\n\nSamsung has proposed something no one else has; the construction of manufacturing plants to produce wind turbine and solar components in Ontario. These manufacturing plants\u2019 orders will provide a foundation for the green manufacturing sector in Ontario.\"304\n\nExh. C-0669.\n\n563.\n\nSusan Lo, the Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for the Implementation of the GEIA at the Ministry of Energy, testified that Ontario entered Into the GEIA because the Government was uncertain how much Interest the FIT Program would generate and because the Korean Consortium would function as an \"anchor tenant\":\n\n\"[Ontario] was uncertain of how much Interest the FIT Program would generate because of the economic conditions at the time. Entering Into a separate framework agreement with the Korean Consortium was seen by Ontario as a prudent means of establishing a foundation for renewable energy generation in the province. The Korean Consortium would provide an \u2018anchor tenant\u2019 for Ontario\u2019s renewable energy sector. Thus, even if the FIT Program failed to generate considerable Interest, there would still be a significant Increase in the amount of renewable electricity being generated for the province.\"305\n\nSue Lo WS I \u00a727.\n\n564.\n\nMs. Lo further testified that the GEIA was expected to develop the manufacturing Industry necessary to support FIT applicants:\n\n\"[T]he GEIA ensured the establishment of a green energy manufacturing sector in Ontario [...] the FIT Program contained requirements that developers source goods and services from Ontario in order to stimulate economic development and job growth. However, at the time, there was almost no local manufacturing available to meet these requirements. The manufacturing facilities required by the GEIA would assist the other renewable energy developers in the FIT Program to meet their domestic content requirements.\"306\n\nSue Lo WS I \u00a728.\n\n565.\n\nThe rationale for the conclusion of the GEIA was thus fourfold. It Included (i) a commitment of an anchor tenant (in circumstances where there were concerns as to the ability of the Ontario Government to achieve its renewable energy goals); (ii) the generation in substantial quantities of green electricity; (III) the attraction of manufacturing plants to Ontario (and in turn the facilitation of domestic content requirements in the FIT Program); and (iv) the creation of jobs (at a time of economic difficulty). These objectives were met - or at least were believed to have been met - by the terms of the GEIA. As will be seen below, the Korean Consortium undertook substantial generation and manufacturing obligations, and its entitlement to transmission capacity was contingent on meeting its commitments to establish and operate manufacturing plants in accordance with the agreed schedule.307\n\nExh. C-0322, GEIA, ss. 7.4 and 8.1.\n\n566.\n\nThe Government\u2019s decision to enter into the GEIA, in spite of the effect that it would have on the FIT Program applicants, was well-explained by the Government:\n\n\"[The Korean Consortium] has proposed the construction of manufacturing plants to produce both wind turbine and solar components in Ontario. No one else has offered something on this scale. Orders for these products will provide a foundation for the green manufacturing sector in Ontario. This kind of economic development is a key objective of both FIT and the Green Energy Act.\"308\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot find that the conclusion of the GEIA was \"arbitrary\", \"grossly unfair\" or \"unreasonable\".\n\nExh. C-0110, Feed-in Tariff Program, Key Messages and Questions & Answers, 6 April 2010.\n\n567.\n\nThe Claimant objects that \"[t]he [GEIA] did not require any special investment on the part of the Korean Consortium\",309 calling the consortium\u2019s commitments under the GEIA \"fictitious\". It argues that the GEIA\u2019s manufacturing commitments were nothing more than the domestic content requirements of the FIT Program. It further asserts that the \"real\" obligation of the Korean Consortium under the GEIA was not to create jobs, but merely to identify the jobs which its suppliers would have created, a job growth equally accomplished through the FIT Program\u2019s domestic content requirement. Mesa further observes that Ontario did not distinguish between the FIT Program and the Korean Consortium\u2019s project when ascertaining the number of jobs created.310\n\nReply \u00a737.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7187(g).\n\n568.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Mesa\u2019s arguments. It notes in particular that the Korean Consortium entered into manufacturing partnership agreements with four partners to establish manufacturing plants in Ontario: SMA (solar inverters); Canadian Solar (solar panels); Siemens (wind turbine blades); and CS Wind (turbine towers).311 in December 2010, i.e. 11 months after the GEIA, Siemens issued a press release stating that it would establish a manufacturing plant in Ontario to help Samsung, a member of the Korean Consortium, to meet its \"contractual\" commitments:\n\n\"Siemens selects Tlllsonburg, Ontario, as new home for Canadian wind turbine blade manufacturing facility\n\nSiemens announced today that it has selected Tillsonburg, Ontario, for its Canadian wind turbine blade manufacturing site. The blade factory will be established in an existing 253,000-square-foot facility, located on 40 acres, that was originally opened in 1975. It\u2019s the company\u2019s first manufacturing plant for wind turbine components in Canada and represents an Investment in excess of $20 million CAD. The manufacturing, service operations and associated back-office activities are expected to create up to 300 jobs. An additional 600 related jobs for the construction and commissioning is expected to be created during the build-out of the wind farms under agreement with Samsung and Pattern.\n\nThis new manufacturing facility in Tillsonburg is Intended to allow Siemens to help Samsung and Pattern Energy meet their contractual requirements to supply 600 MW of renewable energy to the province of Ontario. The factory is expected to produce all of the wind turbine blades for Siemens projects in the province.\"312\n\nSue Lo WS II \u00a78. See also Expert Report of Seabron Adamson dated 27 April 2014 \u00a740 (noting that Samsung has announced four manufacturing partners in Ontario under the GEIA).\n\nExh. C-0594.\n\n569.\n\nFurthermore, the GEIA Imposed substantial generation and manufacturing obligations on the Korean Consortium. Pursuant to Articles 8.1, 8.4 and 9.3 of the GEIA, the Government agreed to an approach for calculating the EDA that was based on the Korean Consortium\u2019s ability to bring manufacturing plants to Ontario. More Importantly, the Korean Consortium had to provide evidence that the manufacturing plants of its partners were established and operational in accordance with the Operational Time Frame set out in Article 8.1 of the GEIA.313 While the Korean Consortium was guaranteed priority access to 2,500 MW of transmission capacity in Ontario in five phases, such guarantee was conditional upon the Consortium complying with commitments to establish and operate four manufacturing plants in accordance with the schedule set out in the GEIA.314 Thus, while benefits were given to the Korean Consortium, they were contingent on the Consortium meeting specific conditions (conditions which were different in both nature and scale to those Imposed on FIT participants).\n\nExh. C-0322, GEIA, ss. 8.6 and 9.3.1.\n\n*Id.* ss. 3.1.3.2, 7.4 and 8.1.\n\n570.\n\nThe GEIA was amended in 2011. Under the terms of the Amended GEIA, to be eligible for the full EDA, the Korean Consortium was required to demonstrate a minimum average of 765 jobs at the plants of its manufacturing partners over a period of at least three years.315 Additionally, the EDA was subject to reduction in the event that a manufacturing plant ceased commercial operation prior to 31 December 2016.316 Both the GEIA and the amended GEIA thus linked the advantages offered to the Korean Consortium under the GEIA to the creation of jobs and the continued commercial operation of the Consortium\u2019s manufacturing plants.\n\nExh. C-0282, Amended Green Energy Investment Agreement (29 July 2011) **(\"Amended GEIA\"),** s. 15.\n\nExh. C-0282, Amended GEIA, s. 13.\n\n571.\n\nIn her testimony at the hearing, Ms. Lo confirmed that, as opposed to the FIT Program, the GEIA would result in job growth in the manufacturing sector:\n\n\"Q. And so for purposes of the GEIA and this renewable energy project, at least you were getting the - the statement, you said you were getting these jobs, you were getting that through the FIT Program, as well; correct?\n\nA. Well, definitely through the FIT Program we would get jobs and many of them were in construction. They weren't necessarily in the manufacturing sector, and the government was very concerned with building a green tech sector.\"317\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 49:24-50:9.\n\n572.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal does not agree that the generation and manufacturing obligations imposed on the Korean Consortium were \"fictitious.\" in fact, it appears that the Korean Consortium had some success in attracting green energy manufacturing jobs to Ontario.318\n\nExh. R-192.\n\n573.\n\nFurther, and in any event, whether or not the GEIA actually succeeded in its objectives is not a relevant consideration, as long as the conclusion of the GEIA was pursuant to a *bona fide* policy decision by the Ontario government, at the time.\n\n574.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal does not regard the conclusion of the GEIA as inconsistent with Article 1105. The Government provided benefits to the Korean Consortium under the GEIA over and above those provided under the FIT Program, but it did so in the context of a program that was not comparable to the FIT Program. On the contrary, the benefits were in return for specific, time-bound and substantial commitments undertaken by the Korean Consortium, different in scale and nature to those imposed on FIT participants, and designed to achieve policy goals beyond the scope of the FIT Program.\n\n575.\n\nIt is true that, at the time when the GEIA was signed, the FIT Program was already in place. It is also true that whilst in some quarters concerns were expressed as to the likely success of the FIT Program, others were confident on this.319 Indeed, in May 2009, the OPA had recognized that there was a \"[h]igh level of developer Interest and expectation\" and \"[h]igh level of Investor *I* financial sector Interest\" in the FIT Program.320 Equally, however, the Respondent contends that the FIT Applications received at the time of the conclusion of the GEIA in January 2010 were not \"good applications\" and that (viewed at that time) there was a risk that the FIT Program might be a failure. The Tribunal notes in this regard that in the FIT/MicroFIT announcement of 15 December 2009, the Ministry of Energy acknowledged that it was \"seeing a tremendous response to the FIT and micro FIT programs\".321 On the other hand, as Richard Duffy, Manager of Generation Procurement at the OPA, testified, additional Information had been required from the FIT Applicants (albeit he did not consider that the Program would be a failure).\n\nSee Testimony of Rick Jennings, Tr. (27 October 2014) 270:1-20; Testimony of Sue Lo, Tr. (28 October 2014) 64:4-16 (FIT program was very successful with applications for 10,000 MW).\n\nExh. R-060, OPA Presentation, \"Feed-in Tariff Program Design Update\", p.4. [CONFIDENTIAL]\n\nExh. C-669, FIT/Micro FIT Announcement, p.1.\n\n576.\n\nIt must also be noted that Jim MacDougall, the Manager of the OPA, admitted that when he learned about the GEIA, he was \"not terribly pleased by the competing development opportunities that were running in parallel\".322 He added that in the final months leading up to the GEIA he had realized that the deal with the Korean Consortium would negatively Impact FIT Applicants.323\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 275:10-14.\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 276:16-20 (\"[C]ertainly the existence of the Korean Consortium commitment through the framework agreement created greater pressure on the FIT Program and less capacity availability through the FIT program to offer contracts.\").\n\n577.\n\nFurther, according to the evidence of Canada\u2019s witnesses, Ontario had no obligation under the MOU of December 2008 to enter Into the GEIA.324 it could have chosen not to sign the formal agreement in January 2010. And, on one view, this might have seemed to make sense considering that it was known in 2009 that the GEIA would Impact the limited available transmission capacity.325\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 59:2-6; Tr. (27 October 2014)199:17-25.\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 275:21-276:9 (\"So I knew that there would be more demand for FIT contracts than there would be supply of contract capacity. So my professional reaction was this just creates less supply of FIT contracts availability, because a portion of the available grid capacity will necessarily need to be allocated to the Korean Consortium.\"); Tr. (28 October 2014) 276:10-20 (\"But certainly the existence of the Korean Consortium commitment through the framework agreement created greater pressure on the FIT program and less capacity available through the FIT program to offer contracts.\").\n\n578.\n\nEqually, the actual need for an \"anchor tenant\" could be questioned. By the time the GEIA was signed in January 2010 (as opposed to its precursor MOU signed in December 2008), it was known that the applications under the FIT Program far exceeded the available capacity. Therefore, it could be argued that no anchor tenant was needed. Moreover, Samsung arguably had no experience with developing wind or solar power and did not then operate renewable energy projects elsewhere. The Claimant also contends that there were procedural irregularities in the GEIA (that it was not approved by the Cabinet,326 and that Ontario\u2019s opposition leader\u2019s request to have the deal be examined by the Auditor General before proceeding was ignored327).\n\nC-PHB \u00a772.\n\nC-PHB \u00a777.\n\n579.\n\nBe that as it may, these are all policy considerations and questions that were for the government of Ontario alone. It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to act as an appellate body in this regard, or second guess or weigh the wisdom of Ontario\u2019s decision to enter into the GEIA at the time - even if sufficient renewable energy would possibly have been available through the FIT Program.328 Rather, it is for the Tribunal to examine whether, as the Claimant alleges, the beneficial treatment was granted to the Korean Consortium arbitrarily, or in any other way that contravened Article 1105. In particular, the Tribunal must determine whether Canada\u2019s conclusion of the GEIA lacked a justification, and whether there was a reasonable relationship between the justification supplied and the terms of the GEIA.329 For the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that such justification and reasonable relationship did exist. It is a different question, on which the Tribunal does not express a view, whether entering into the GEIA was a wise move under the circumstances. As a result, the Tribunal rejects the claim that by entering into the GEIA, Canada breached Article 1105 of the NAFTA.\n\nSee Exh. RL-065, *Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of Mongolia* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 28 April 2011, \u00a7316 (\"it is not the role of the Tribunal to weigh the wisdom of legislation, but merely to assess whether such legislation breaches the Treaty. Claimants have not succeeded in demonstrating that this was an abusive or irrational decision\").\n\nThe Claimant agrees, although it adopts a different formulation. See Tr. (26 October 2014) 61:19-62:2 (\"And with respect to the protection against arbitrariness, the state breaches its customary international law obligation when it acts arbitrarily for instance, on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact. Arbitrariness also occurs when discretionary decisions by governments are based on irrelevant considerations and when relevant considerations are ignored.\").\n\n580.\n\nIn the same context, the Claimant protests about the detrimental effect which the GEIA produced on FIT Applicants including itself. In particular, it criticizes the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium in the Bruce Region.330 According to the Claimant, the \"secret\"331 reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium was politically motivated332 and in disregard of the FIT process.333 Indeed, so it is argued, it effectively undermined the FIT process.334 Although the OPA had estimated that 1,200 MW of transmission capacity would be available in the Bruce Region because of the Bruce to Milton Line, it turned out that only 750 MW were available to FIT Applicants, as the remainder was set aside for the Korean Consortium.335\n\nC-PHB \u00a714.\n\nMem. \u00a7767.\n\nMem. \u00a7713.\n\nMem. \u00a7714.\n\nMem. \u00a7763.\n\nExh.

C-0292, Ontario Power Authority, \"FIT Contract Offers for the Bruce-Milton Capacity Allocation Process,\" 4 July 2011.\n\n581.\n\nAs was mentioned above, in exchange for the commitments of the Korean Consortium, the GEIA granted the Korean Consortium a guarantee of access to priority transmission.336 The Consortium could reserve this capacity anywhere in Ontario by Indicating connection points of its choice.337 On 30 September 2010, the Consortium Indicated provisional connection points in the Bruce Region.338 As a result, on 17 September 2010, the Minister of Energy directed the OPA to reserve 500 MW of transmission capacity in the Bruce area.339 The Korean Consortium then formally asked for capacity in the Bruce Region in November of that year.340\n\nExh.

Final confirmation of its connection points was provided on 7 January 2011.\n\n*Id.*\n\nTr. (31 October 2014) 25:17-26:13.\n\n582.\n\nThe Claimant first alleges that the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium was done in \"secret.\" The record does not substantiate this allegation. As will be seen below (\u00a7\u00a7596 et. seq.), the Claimant was aware that the Korean Consortium had the right to reserve transmission capacity in Ontario even before its Investment in Canada. Although it could not have known then that the Korean Consortium would actually reserve capacity in the Bruce Region, the Claimant should have known that this was a serious possibility. Indeed, the Claimant\u2019s expert Seabron Adamson testified that participants in the wind industry would have been aware that transmission capacity would become available on the Bruce to Milton Line since the time of its proposed development. In the same vein, Bob Chow, Director of Transmission Integration at the OPA, testified that the Bruce Region was a \"recipe for success\" as the wind regime was the strongest in the province. Further, the fact that the Government was reserving transmission capacity as a priority for the Korean Consortium was officially announced on 21 January 2010, i.e. one and a half years before capacity was allocated in the Bruce Region,341 and the fact that 500 MW were reserved in the Bruce Region for the Korean Consortium was publicly announced on 17 September 2010, i.e. months before the Bruce to Milton allocation process was developed.342 Thus, the Tribunal cannot agree that the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium was done in \"secret.\"\n\nExh. R-076.\n\nExh. C-0119.\n\n583.\n\nThe Claimant next argues that the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium was in and of itself incompatible with Article 1105. For reasons it has already mentioned above, the Tribunal cannot accept this argument. While the benefit of priority access to transmission conferred on the Korean Consortium reduced the available capacity in the Bruce Region, this was merely the result of the limited capacity present in Ontario, a fact that was well known to all at the time. To meet its stated goals for renewable energy generation, economic development and job growth, the Government chose to reserve capacity for the Korean Consortium. It did so in the context of a policy initiative that was not comparable to the FIT Program, and in the exercise of its discretion as to how best to achieve its objectives. This was an exercise of discretion which the Tribunal cannot fault under the circumstances, and has no basis to second-guess.\n\n584.\n\nAn internal document evinces the Government\u2019s reasons for the reservation of capacity for the Korean Consortium in spite of the FIT Program, in the following terms:\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t the set aside for the Korean consortium undermine the whole intent of the FIT program?\n\nNot at all. The Korean Consortium has proposed something no one else has; the construction of manufacturing plants to produce wind turbine and solar components in Ontario. Orders for these products will provide a foundation for the green manufacturing sector in Ontario. This kind of economic development is a key objective of both FIT and the Green Energy Act.\"343\n\nExh. C-0110.\n\n585.\n\nThe Claimant also complains that, in addition to the reservation of transmission capacity, the Korean Consortium was given better governmental assistance; \"received better pricing for renewable power sold in PPAs and automatic rights to increase power project size\"; was allowed to engage in a \"wait-and-see\" approach to acquire low ranked FIT projects that were unlikely to get contracts and then convert them into GEIA projects; and received exclusivity as the Ministry agreed that it would not enter into similar transactions with third parties upon terms identical to the GEIA. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, assuming that these benefits were effectively granted, they would not rise to the level of a breach of Article 1105. If granted, they may or may not have been the best, or even just a good exercise, of judgment and discretion for purposes of reaching the stated objectives. But even if this were so, the facts in the record do not evidence conduct meeting the stringent requirements of Article 1105.\n\n586.\n\nThe Claimant further refers to the Korean Consortium\u2019s breaches of the GEIA and challenges the Government\u2019s choice not to terminate the GEIA as a consequence of those breaches. It claims that this choice resulted in a breach of Article 1105.344 it is true that the Korean Consortium may not have met the deadlines provided in the 2010 GEIA and that the agreement was amended on two occasions.345 Under the first amendment, the EDA was reduced in exchange for an extension of the time limits stipulated in the agreement346 and the time for specifying Phase 2 connection points was eliminated.347 Under the second amendment, the priority transmission capacity of the Korean Consortium was reduced from 2,500 MW to 1,369 MW.348 These amendments thus linked the level of the EDA to the creation of jobs and the continued operation of manufacturing plants.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant first fully expanded this argument in its post-hearing submission and thus the Respondent had no opportunity to address it.\n\nExh. C-0282, Amended GEIA; Exh. R-133, Amended and Restated GEIA, s. 3.4 (20 June 2013).\n\nExh. C-0282, Amended GEIA, s. 15.\n\n*Id.* at ss. 9, 17, 19-20.\n\nExh. R-133, s. 3.\n\n587.\n\nWhile it may be that all the original intentions of the Ministry in entering into the GEIA were not fully met, it remains that the principal contractual obligations of the Korean Consortium were retained. As the Claimant itself recognizes,349 a government cannot be faulted for being unable to meet each and every one of its stated policy goals, a recognition that is particularly apposite in the context of an Article 1105 assessment. In the circumstances, Mesa\u2019s claim that the Government\u2019s failure to terminate the GEIA was \"grossly unfair\" or \"Inequitable\" cannot be sustained.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7250 (\"[G]overnments cannot be held to the unreasonably high standard of successfully implementing all policy goals, they must be accountable for the stated policies and the implementation of those policies.\").\n\n(ii) Non-Disclosure of the GEIA Terms\n-------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position\n---------------------------\n\n588.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s case that the customary International law standard is breached when a party acts without transparency and that \"[f]rom the first time Mesa engaged with Ontario\u2019s FIT Program in 2009, there was a complete lack of transparency and candor on Ontario\u2019s part with respect to its dealings with the Korean Consortium.\"350 it points out that the OPA was not informed until the summer of 2009 of the secret deal with the Korean Consortium and the public was only made aware of it on 26 September 2009. The Claimant adds that the public was not told of the MOU of December 2008 nor of the Framework Agreement which was allegedly signed in October 2009 until after the FIT Program was announced.351\n\nC-PHB \u00a74.\n\nReply \u00a774.\n\n589.\n\nMesa also claims that in 2010 the Minister of Economic Development and Trade encouraged it to Invest in Canada. However neither the Minister nor her officials advised Mesa that there was another possibility of accessing the Ontario market than the FIT Program. In other words, it was not Invited to engage in negotiations with the Ontario Government to Invest in renewable energy outside the FIT Program.352\n\nReply \u00a721.\n\n590.\n\nTo counter the Respondent\u2019s Invocation of reports published in the Toronto Star, the Claimant contends that these reports \"were vague and misleading and did not disclose the main contours of the deal, such as priority transmission access.\"353\n\nC-PHB \u00a7295.\n\n591.\n\nTo the extent that the GEIA was publicly discussed, the Claimant submits that \"the government of Ontario made material misrepresentations at the highest levels as to the content and terms of the GEIA. These representations were fundamentally misleading as to the opportunities available to access the renewable energy market in Ontario, as well as to the conditions that access could be obtained.\"354\n\nReply \u00a7657. See also C-PHB \u00a712(d).\n\n(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n592.\n\nCanada disputes the Claimant\u2019s submission that Article 1105 Imposes an obligation on the NAFTA Parties to act with complete transparency in all their operations. It states that no authority supports the Claimant\u2019s argument that NAFTA Parties must be transparent about their commercial negotiations. Such negotiations, given their nature, must be allowed to be conducted in confidence in order to succeed.355\n\nRej. \u00a7154.\n\n593.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent states that the Government publicized its dealings with the Korean Consortium \"as much as possible.\"356 The Toronto Star article, which was published prior to the Claimant\u2019s Investment in Canada, discussed the main terms of the forthcoming GEIA, Including the manufacturing commitments, the creation of jobs, and the EDA. Further, through its September direction to the OPA requiring the reservation of transmission capacity, the Government publicly disclosed that it was negotiating a province-wide framework agreement for the generation of renewable energy. Therefore, so says Canada, Mesa was fully aware of the fact that the GEIA was being negotiated and of its key terms. As a result, the Claimant\u2019s complaints about the secret nature of the deal must be dismissed.\n\nRej. \u00a7155.\n\n594.\n\nIn answer to the Claimant\u2019s reliance on statements of the Minister of Economic Development and Trade, the Respondent observes that Mesa merely alleges that the Minister had encouraged it to Invest in Ontario. Encouragements of this nature are Insufficient to create expectations that could be pertinent for purposes of a breach of Article 1105. Finally, the statements of the Minister are in any event Irrelevant, because the Claimant had already made its Investment when it spoke with the Minister.\n\n(c) Analysis\n------------\n\n595.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that transparency forms part of the customary International law standard enshrined in Article 1105, which the Respondent disputes. The existence of an obligation of transparency under international law and under Article 1105 of the NAFTA in particular is a controversial issue. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to enter into the merits of this debate in the context of this dispute. For the reasons discussed below, the Tribunal finds that sufficient information about the Ministry\u2019s dealings with the Korean Consortium was in the public domain prior to the Claimant\u2019s investment in Ontario. Thus, even if an obligation of transparency of the kind suggested by the Claimant existed - an issue on which the Tribunal expresses no opinion - that obligation would be satisfied here.\n\n596.\n\nOn 24 September 2009, the Ministry of Energy directed the OPA to develop the FIT Program. Two days later, on 26 September, the Toronto Star reported for the first time that Ontario was in negotiations with Samsung for a special deal on renewable energy:357\n\n\"Ontario eyes green job bonanza [...]\n\nThe Ontario government is in advanced negotiations with South Korean industrial and electronics powerhouse Samsung Group about manufacturing wind turbines and other green-energy gear - including solar panels - in the province.\n\nSamsung is considering a multibillion-dollar investment that would stimulate the creation of several hundred direct jobs and, indirectly, potentially thousands more. The province, led by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, has been in talks with Samsung subsidiary Samsung C&T Corp, for the past year, the Star has learned.\n\nEnergy Minister George Smitherman confirmed in an interview with the Star that serious discussions are ongoing and proceeding well toward the signing of what he called a \u2018historic framework agreement.\u2019\n\n\u2018They\u2019re looking to get into the renewable-energy business in a big way, and Ontario seems suited to their ambitions,\u2019 said Smitherman.\n\n\u2018If it comes to fruition, it would see them invest several billions of dollars and have the prospect of creating hundreds and hundreds of jobs in manufacturing at the same time.\u2019\n\nThat would be a coup for a province that has suffered a steep decline in manufacturing, particularly in the hard-hit auto sector, and the loss of thousands of jobs.\n\nIt also represents an early sign that Ontario\u2019s new Green Energy and Economy Act, designed to stimulate the development of renewable-energy projects, is attracting the foreign investment and \u2018green-collar\u2019jobs promised by Premier Dalton McGuinty.\n\n[...]\n\nSmitherman said Samsung, as a developer, will get the same rate as every other developer taking part in the [FIT] program. But if the company commits to manufacturing its equipment in Ontario, it will get what he called an \u2018economic adder\u2019 on top of the 13.5 cents rate. He wouldn\u2019t say how much that benefit might be.\"\n\nExh. R-177, Toronto Star, \"Ontario eyes green job bonanza\".\n\n597.\n\nOn the day on which the news article appeared, the Ministry of Energy and Samsung C&T Corporation Issued a joint statement regretting that Information about the negotiations had been prematurely released to the public:358\n\n\"Statement from the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Samsung C & T Corporation\n\nRecently Information concerning negotiations between Samsung C and T Corporation and the Government of Ontario has prematurely entered the public domain.\n\nBoth parties regret that months of extraordinarily cooperative effort have become known even while serious discussions are ongoing.\n\nHowever, both Samsung C and T Corporation and the Government of Ontario are pleased to confirm that efforts are progressing well toward the signing of a historic framework agreement.\n\nWhile the contents of the proposed agreement remain commercially sensitive, both parties can confirm that Samsung, one of the world\u2019s leading companies, proposes to establish a new renewable energy business in Ontario where the Feed in Tariff was recently launched as part of the Green Energy Act.\n\nThe substantial scale of the proposed Investment would be a very early sign of success of the Green Energy Act and would lead to the establishment of new manufacturing capacity in Ontario.\n\nBoth parties are committed to a more formal public presentation once a framework agreement has been completed.\"\n\nExh. R-068, News Release, \"Statement from the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Samsung C&T Corporation\", p.2.\n\n598.\n\nA few days later, on 30 September 2009, the Minister of Energy publicly directed the OPA to reserve capacity for the Korean Consortium as follows:\n\n\"The Government is exploring opportunities to further enable new green Industries through new Investment and job creation and provide Incentives for Investment in renewable energy technologies.\n\n[...]\n\nI now further direct the OPA [...] to hold in reserve 240 MW of transmission capacity in Haldimand County and a total of 260 MW of transmission capacity in Essex County and the Municipality of Chatham-Kent jointly for renewable energy generating facilities whose proponents have signed a province-wide framework agreement with the Province.\"\n\n599.\n\nOn 31 October 2009, the Korean Consortium\u2019s priority access to transmission capacity was addressed in the press in the following terms:359\n\n\"Samsung\u2019s turbine deal in jeopardy [...]\n\nSmitherman touted it as a \u2018historic framework agreement\u2019 that would see Samsung develop green energy projects and manufacture equipment to support them. In return, the province would reward Samsung with incentives above what other wind and solar developers can get.\n\n[...]\n\nAt issue is what some Liberals believe is a sweetheart deal with a foreign firm, which would also get priority access to Ontario grid space.\"\n\nExh. R-178.\n\n600.\n\nAbout a week later, on 8 November 2009, the transaction with the Korean Consortium was once again mentioned in the press.360\n\nExh. C-0660.\n\n601.\n\nCole Robertson, who was responsible for the day to day operations of Mesa at the time, admitted that Mesa was aware of the press reports about the Ministry\u2019s deal with the Korean Consortium:\n\n\"Q. [P]ut yourself back into this position at the time, can you just explain: Did you see these reports at the time?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir, did we see them at the time? We did see them at the time and what was our reaction to them? We were concerned, I think as any prudent developer would be.\n\n[...]\n\nI knew the minute these releases were made, maybe not the minute but within a few hours, that they were made, I was notified and reviewed.\"361\n\nTr. (27 October 2014) 143:19-146:20.\n\n602.\n\nMr. Robertson also conceded that he did not approach the Ministry for further information on the Toronto Star article or the Ministry\u2019s press release:\n\n\"Q. Did you contact the Ministry to confirm whether these stories were accurate, of the GEIA?\n\nA. The Toronto Star story?\n\nQ. Yeah, the Toronto Star story or the Initial - the press release of the same day from the Ministry?\n\nA. [...] no, we did not contact the Ministry of Energy or the Ontario Government about the story, no.\"\n\n603.\n\nMesa did not even approach the Ministry after the conclusion of the GEIA was publicly disclosed, as the oral evidence of Mr. Robertson showed:\n\n\"Q. Did you contact the Ministry after [the conclusion of the GEIA was made public]?\n\nA. We did not.\"362\n\nAnd further:\n\n\"THE WITNESS: On the publications by both the Toronto Star and the OPA or, I believe, it's Ministry - Minister of Energy release as it relates to this. On those articles we did not contact the government.\"363\n\nTr. (27 October 2014) 140:24-141:1.\n\nTr. (27 October 2014) 143:24-141:1.\n\n604.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert Mr. Adamson accepted that the Claimant could have known about the Ministry\u2019s agreement with the Korean Consortium and its key terms as early as September 2009, prior to applying for the FIT Program.364 He also admitted that the Claimant could have been aware that the Korean Consortium would have priority access to Ontario\u2019s grid space before filing its FIT Applications.365\n\nTr. (29 October 2014) 211:10-218:7.\n\nTr. (29 October 2014) 211:10-218:7.\n\n605.\n\nIt is true that the OPA was not made aware of the agreement with the Korean Consortium until the summer of 2009. In fact, Jim MacDougall, the manager of the OPA, testified that the OPA was never informed of nor consulted about the GEIA negotiations and that, when he heard about the agreement, he was \"not terribly pleased.\"366 Yet, pursuant to Ms. Lo\u2019s plausible explanation, the need to consult with the OPA arose only when the GEIA had to be put in operation.367\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 275:10-14.\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 16:11-17:13 (\"Q. Okay. Well, in fact the Ministry of Energy did not consult with the OPA [...] regarding the memorandum of understanding with the Korean Consortium, did it? A. I understand that that\u2019s the case, but it wouldn't be a normal course of action to consult with the OPA [...] The OPA receives policy direction, and then carries it out, but there wouldn\u2019t be any need to consult with either body. If say they needed to be consulted with, well, that\u2019s their opinion, but working in government for 30 years, they wouldn't be a normal body that one would consult with. Q. Well, frequently during the implementation of the FIT program the Minister of Energy did consult with the OPA? A. The FIT program is very different, because it is operationalizing a renewable energy program that was already created in a higher level policy. So, for instance, the Green Energy and Green Economy Act, would the Ministry of Energy consult with the OPA [...]? No. Not necessarily, no.\").\n\n606.\n\nIt is equally true that on 13 November 2009, the Ministry asked the Korean Consortium to postpone publicizing the \"various elements of the deal\" for a \"few weeks\":\n\n\"[Y]ou should not be going ahead with any public announcement on this or any other piece of the deal until we have resolved the issue of the signing of the Framework Agreement. This will simply elicit more questions from the media that we are not in a position to answer publicly yet and will put us in a difficult position. Once the FA is signed, and the terms are public, you will be free to execute the various elements of the deal. Until then, you need to put this on hold for the time being - hopefully only a couple of weeks.368\n\nExh. C-0683, Email from Jennifer Morris (MOE) to Hagen Lee (Samsung), 13 November 2009. See also Tr. (27 October 2014) 310:20-311:1; Tr. (28 October 2014) 74:2-6 [CONFIDENTIAL],\n\n607.\n\nThese facts appear to indicate that the Ministry worked towards two parallel renewable energy programs - the GEIA and the FIT Program - without fully informing the public and other stakeholders of one of them, namely the GEIA. Be that as it may, prior to the Claimant\u2019s investment in November 2009, the following information was publicly available and known to the Claimant: (i) the negotiations with the Korean Consortium were at an \"advanced stage\"369; (ii) pursuant to those negotiations, the Korean Consortium would get an \"economic adder\" or EDA in addition to the regular rate \"if [it] committed] to manufacturing its equipment in Ontario\"370; (iii) the OPA had been instructed to hold in reserve transmission capacity for \"generating facilities whose proponents have signed a province-wide framework agreement\"371; and (iv) the agreement with the Korean Consortium \"would give them priority access to Ontario[\u2019s] grid space\".372\n\nExh. R-177.\n\n*Id.*\n\nExh. C-105, George Smitherman\u2019s (MOE) Direction of 30 September 2009 to the OPA. The Claimant argues that the use of the past tense in the Direction (\"have signed\") misled the public by suggesting that a province-wide investment agreement had already been signed, which was not the case. However, the Tribunal believes that this language is sufficiently broad to encompass investment agreements that had, already been or were about to be concluded in a near future. As is discussed elsewhere, the Claimant admitted that it did not request additional information about the GEIA from the Ministry, which it reasonably should have done had there been an ambiguity.\n\nExh. R-178.\n\n608.\n\nOn the basis of these facts, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the Ministry\u2019s dealings with the Korean Consortium were secret. Even if the details of the agreement between the Ministry and the Korean Consortium were not disclosed, sufficient information about the main terms of the transaction was in the public domain before the Claimant made its investment in Ontario.373 What is more, the record shows that the Claimant was well aware of this Information.374\n\nThe Claimant has alleged that Mesa decided to invest in Ontario in the summer of 2009. If that were the case, then the Claimant\u2019s investment would precede the first Toronto Star Article. However, for the reasons mentioned above (\u00a7\u00a7324 et. seq.), the Tribunal considers the date of the Claimant\u2019s investment to be the date of incorporation of its projects i.e. 17 November 2009 for TTD and Arran.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that because Canada\u2019s deal with the Korean Consortium was not public, the Korean Consortium \"went so far as to require a \u2018comfort letter\u2019 explaining the arrangement and its contours\" (C-PHB \u00a730(c)).The Tribunal cannot draw this conclusion on the basis of the evidence supplied by the Claimant. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant\u2019s argument, it would not alter the outcome.\n\n609.\n\nOn a related aspect, the Claimant alleges that it was not given an opportunity to enter Into a similar deal with the Ministry and that it would have done so if it had been given the opportunity.375 in this context, it stresses that the agreement with the Korean Consortium prohibited Ontario from entering Into a similar contract376 unless the latter agreement was comparable in value and scope to the former.377\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7296-297; C-PHB \u00a712(a).\n\nSee C-PHB \u00a712 (\"e. Effectively agreeing in the GEIA to not provide a similar deal to anyone else\").\n\nC-PHB \u00a785 citing GEIA, s. 8.7.\n\n610.\n\nAs was just discussed, before Investing in Canada, Mesa knew about the Ministry\u2019s agreement with the Korean Consortium and could have Inquired with the competent officials about a similar Investment opportunity in addition to or *in lieu* of its participation in the FIT Program. Mr. Adamson, the Claimant\u2019s expert, admitted that Mesa could have approached the Ministry with a proposal for an Investment agreement providing for priority transmission.378 Yet, Mesa did not do so, as Mr. Robertson explained. Despite its knowledge of the Ministry\u2019s agreement with the Korean Consortium, Mesa never asked for additional Information about the agreement or the possibility of entering Into its own Investment agreement with the province.379 As the Claimant did not approach the Ministry with a view to obtaining more Information or entering Into a GEIA-like agreement, its submission that it was deprived of an opportunity to enter Into such an agreement can hardly be sustained.\n\nTr. (29 October 2014) 212:22-214:21.\n\nTr. (27 October 2014) 134:1-15, 142:6-144:21, 146:2-7.\n\n611.\n\nFurthermore, besides Mr. Robertson\u2019s statement that Mesa \"would have tried\", the Claimant has provided no plausible indications that it would actually have approached the Ministry.380 As it happens, as the Claimant itself acknowledged in its later submissions, the Ministry could not have entertained a request for a GEIA-like agreement, due to the lack of transmission capacity resulting from the success of the FIT Program and the GEIA. Hence, the Ministry rejected all the offers which it received from investors for a GEIA-like agreement.381 But this is beside the point. What ultimately matters is that the Claimant had knowledge of the existence and key terms of the conclusion of the GEIA before it invested into the FIT Program and that it did not seek another investment opportunity, but proceeded with its investment notwithstanding.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7\u00a782-83.\n\n*See* Testimony of Rick Jennings, Tr. (27 October 2014) 327:5-337:3 (discussing the Ministry of Energy\u2019s rejection of proposals from Recurrent, NTS and NextEra); Exhs. C-710-713. See also Exh. C-714, Letter from Minister Brad Duguid to Anthony Caputo, ATS Automation Systems, Undated (stating that Ontario was not in a position to enter into a \"special\" deal with competitors of the Korean Consortium, and refusing to enter into a GEIA-like agreement with ATS), and Exh. C-696, Email from Samira Viswanathan (MOE) to Mirrun Zaveri (MOE), 20 December 2010 (stating that Ontario was not in a position to offer other proponents a deal similar to that offered to the Korean Consortium).\n\n612.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant also complained of another \"secret\" deal between Ontario and the Korean Consortium, to which it refers as the \"Framework Agreement\". Rick Jennings, Assistant Deputy Minister of Energy Supply at the Ministry of Energy gave evidence that no such additional agreement existed; the framework agreement of October 2009 was merely an earlier draft of the GEIA. It was not signed in October as originally planned, but rather in January 2010, at which time it became known as the GEIA.382 in light of these explanations, which appear credible, the Tribunal will not further address this complaint.\n\nJennings WS II \u00a7\u00a79-11. See also Respondent\u2019s letter of 28 April 2014.\n\n(iii) Delay of the ECT\n----------------------\n\n613.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in addition to removing transmission capacity that could have been awarded to FIT Applicants, the Korean Consortium also delayed the award of the FIT Contracts.383 it emphasizes that, before the third round of FIT Contracts could be awarded, the OPA had to conduct an ECT. This ECT was not run as scheduled in August 2010 because the Korean Consortium had not finalized the connection points for its projects under the GEIA.384 For Mesa, this delay prevented the TTD and Arran projects from receiving FIT Contracts.385\n\nReply \u00a7123.\n\nReply \u00a7125.\n\nReply \u00a7799(b).\n\n614.\n\nIt is true that the ECT was never carried out, a topic further addressed below. It is also true that the third round of FIT Contracts was delayed. However, as will be discussed in greater detail in the context of the allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region, Article 1105 provides no guarantee against regulatory change. This is all the more so in the present case where the FIT Rules expressly state that they may be reviewed and amended, particularly in response to \"significant changes in market conditions or other circumstances as required.\" The Claimant was fully aware of and accepted these provisions when it filed its FIT Applications with the OPA.\n\n615.\n\nIn any event, the sole fact that the ECT was not carried out when it should have been cannot constitute a breach of Article 1105, especially where the Claimant has not shown that it was prejudiced by the delay.\n\n**c. Allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n616.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it reasonably expected the Ministry and the OPA to \"fairly administer the FIT Rules without acting in a capricious and abusive manner.\"386 However, the Minister\u2019s direction of 3 June 2011 (the **\"3 June Direction\")** led to \"arbitrary and unexpected\" changes to the FIT Rules.387 For the Claimant, the 3 June Direction was Issued without advance notice388 and departed significantly from the procedure previously established.389\n\nReply \u00a723.\n\nMem. \u00a7688.\n\nReply \u00a7114.\n\nMem. \u00a7722.\n\n617.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent denies that the 3 June Direction was an unexpected or arbitrary change of the FIT Program. According to it, the process used to allocate the capacity available in the Bruce Region was not materially different from the one publicly discussed by the OPA ever since the Initiation of the FIT Program. In any event, even if the FIT Program did change in a way that ultimately affected the Claimant, Canada submits that this change would not violate Article 1105, because that provision does not prevent a government from changing its regulatory regime in response to new policies and needs.\n\n618.\n\nThe Claimant has raised a litany of objections in respect of the allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region. In the discussion below, the Tribunal will start by setting forth its understanding of the allocation process (a), before reviewing the Claimant\u2019s objections (b).\n\n619.\n\nAt the outset, however, the Tribunal wishes to recall that Article 1105 does not provide a guarantee against regulatory change. A State may amend its laws and regulations as it deems appropriate in light of changing circumstances. The absence of protection against changes in the legal regime is particularly relevant here in a situation where the FIT Program had undergone several amendments.390 in fact, the Claimant itself recognized that \"prospective FIT Applicants [had] to navigate a changing landscape of FIT Rules and requirements\", and that \"Ontario\u2019s regulators were continuously updating and modifying the program\".391\n\nFrom the time the program was announced in September2009 through 2012, the FIT Rules changed 10 times. See Reply fn. 109.\n\nReply \u00a7113.\n\n620.\n\nFurther, as mentioned above, the FIT Rules expressly stipulate that they may be reviewed and amended, particularly in response to \"significant changes in market conditions or other circumstances as required.\"392 As was already noted, in respect of the ECT delay, the Claimant was fully aware of and accepted these provisions when it submitted its FIT Applications.\n\nExh. R-003, FIT Program Rules, v. 1.2 s. 10.1(1).\n\n(i) Allocation process\n----------------------\n\n621.\n\nThe framework of the FIT Program has been outlined earlier in this Award (\u00a7\u00a712 et. seq.). As mentioned there, the OPA was to conduct an ECT to determine whether the existing transmission system should be upgraded to accommodate those projects for which no capacity was available, i.e. projects that had failed the TAT.\n\n622.\n\nWhile the ECT was to be carried out only for projects that had failed the TAT, additional capacity on the existing transmission system could have become available following the TAT run as a result of the addition of new transmission facilities or of the cancellation of projects.393 Therefore, the first step in the ECT was to conduct an individual project assessment **(\"IPA\")** so as to determine whether a project could be connected to the existing grid.394 As part of the IPA, the OPA would provide TAT Tables to FIT Applicants to Inform them where capacity was available.395 As a next step of the ECT, FIT Applicants could change their connection point during an allotted time so as to make use of additional capacity in the existing system.396 Information on how to request a change of connection point was posted on the OPA\u2019s FIT website.397\n\nExh.

These constraints were resolved by the construction of the Bruce to Milton Line in May 2011. The additional capacity created by this line in the Bruce and West of London regions was originally planned to be allocated through an ECT.398\n\nExh.

If all the capacity was awarded, the Impact on electricity prices would have been significant.400 The Ministry thus needed to slow down the rate of procurement of renewable energy. Second, the Ministry also needed to address the decreasing demand of electricity because of the effect of the economic recession. Third, through the LTEP, Ontario had Introduced a new renewable energy target of 10,700 MW to be met by 2018.401 Out of this target amount, the 2011 Supply Mix Directive required that 10-15% be met with renewables. Ms. Lo testified about the circumstances that led to the LTEP in the following terms:402\n\n\"[T]he number of [FIT] applications was growing at a rate that far exceeded the ability of the physical electricity system [...] to accommodate new renewables projects. If all of the companies which applied for FIT contracts were awarded such contracts, a far greater proportion of Ontario\u2019s supply mix would be made up of renewable energy than had been recommended by experts, which in turn, would make the operation of the electricity system difficult to manage.\n\n[...]\n\nMoreover, if all of the applications for FIT projects were awarded contracts under the program the impacts on ratepayers would be significant.\n\n[...]\n\nThe culmination of these supply and demand factors confirmed [that] Ontario would need to slow down the rate of its procurement of renewable energy. Accordingly, the 2010 LTEP introduced a target amount for Ontario to procure a total of 10,700 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2018.\"\n\nSue Lo WS I \u00a7\u00a734-40.\n\nJennings WS I \u00a7\u00a717-18.\n\nExh.

Under the regional ECT, FIT Applicants in the Bruce and West of London regions would have the opportunity to apply for a change of connection points during a five-day window and to select connection points for which generator paid upgrades would be required.406 This decision was conveyed to the OPA through the 3 June Direction. On the same day, the OPA released version 1.5 of the FIT Rules Implementing this direction.407\n\nExh. R-011, Letter (Direction) from Minister Brad Duguid to Colin Andersen, Ontario Power Authority (3 June 2011).\n\nExh.

It will then focus on whether the process was designed to benefit particular FIT Applicants to the detriment of others (ii).\n\ni. Allocation of capacity in the Bruce Region\n---------------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the following acts of the Ministry violated Article 1105: the decision not to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a \"full\" ECT process (a. below); and the decision to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a \"regional\" ECT process rather than a special TAT (b. below). It also argues that the process ultimately used to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line violated Article 1105 (c. below).\n\na. The decision not to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a \"full\" ECT\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nThe Claimant challenges the Ministry\u2019s decision not to run a full ECT.408 it complains that despite its repeated assurances, the ECT was never conducted.\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7735-762 (\"Part 4, IV(iv) - Failing to conduct and Economic Connection Test as required by the FIT Rules\"; \"Part 4, IV(v) - Mesa Power expected its projects to participate in the ECT in 2010, and not conducting the ECT deprived Mesa of the opportunity to compete for a FIT Contract\"; \"Part 4, IV(vi) - The Failure to conduct an ECT prior to the Bruce to Milton capacity allocation process caused Mesa Power to lose contract awards\").\n\n630.\n\nIt is true that the FIT Program originally contemplated an ECT in order to determine whether and where to build up further transmission capacity for the FIT Program. However, as has been noted earlier, much had changed in the Ontario electricity market since the conception of the FIT Program. It is in these changed circumstances as they were identified in a foregoing section that the Ministry decided not to carry out an ECT. This being so, it sought, however, to design a regional ECT-like process that would be as close as possible to the province-wide allocation initially envisaged.409 The Tribunal does not deem this decision incompatible with the guarantee of Article 1105. Indeed, the Ministry took its decision in light of the prevailing circumstances based on reasonable and rational considerations.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Exh. R-182, Draft Ontario Power Authority Presentation, \"Economic Connection Test (ECT) Moving Forward\" (1 March 2011) (reflecting the various policy considerations and decisions needing to be made, and the extensive discussions that took place, with respect to allocating capacity on the Bruce-to-Milton Line); Exh. C-438, OPA Presentation, Economic Connection Test (ECT) & Program Evolution (21 March 2011) and Exh. R-183, Ontario Ministry of Energy Presentation, \"DRAFT KC and Future FIT Accommodation on Near-Term Transmission Projects\" (21 March 2011) (both reflecting the various policy considerations and decisions needing to be made, and the extensive discussions that took place, with respect to allocating capacity on the Bruce-to-Milton Line).\n\nb. The decision to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a \"regional\" ECT process rather than a special TAT\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nThe Claimant next argues that the Ministry\u2019s decision to allocate the Bruce to Milton capacity through a regional ECT process rather than through the special TAT process proposed by the OPA violated Article 1105.410\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7137-163, 645-654, 682-711.\n\n632.\n\nFrom its submissions, it is clear that Mesa would have preferred the Government to adopt the special TAT approach over the regional ECT that eventually prevailed. But as already emphasized on several occasions in this Award, it is not for this Tribunal to second-guess a government\u2019s policy choices, or to ascertain whether the policy goals of the government would have been better served by resorting to other means. The Tribunal\u2019s task is only to determine whether the Government has breached Article 1105 by following the policy in question.\n\n633.\n\nin the present case, the Tribunal can see nothing arbitrary or otherwise in breach of the Article 1105 standard about the Ministry\u2019s decision to adopt a regional ECT rather than a special TAT process.\n\n634.\n\nOnce capacity became available in the Bruce Region because of the Bruce to Milton Line, the question before the Ministry was how to allocate this capacity. Three options were under consideration: (1) continuing with the ECT as originally designed; or (2) adopting the proposal drawn up by the Ministry; or (3) resorting to a proposal prepared by the OPA.411 The proposals of the Ministry and of the OPA were similar in most respects.412\n\nExh. C-0438, OPA Presentation, Economic Connection Test (ECT) & Program Evolution (21 March 2011); Cronkwright WS II \u00a716.\n\nCronkwright WS I \u00a74.\n\n635.\n\nAs time progressed, the OPA became concerned about its ability to complete the process which it had proposed.413 As a result, it proposed a new \"special TAT/DAT\" process under which contracts would be awarded on the basis of the connection points Identified in their original applications. The OPA would re-run the TAT process but only for the Bruce and West of London regions. The process would not Involve changes in connection points or generator paid upgrades, and would be fast and straightforward from an Implementation perspective.414 This, however, required amendments to the FIT Rules.415 As an additional drawback, it did not conform to the expectations of FIT Applicants on how the Bruce to Milton capacity would be awarded.416\n\nExh. C-0439, p. 2; Exh. C-0440; Cronkwright WS II \u00a7\u00a717-18.\n\nChow WS II, \u00a77; Cronkwright WS II \u00a7\u00a717-18.\n\nCronkwright WS II \u00a718.\n\nCronkwright WS II \u00a720; Chow WS II \u00a76.\n\n636.\n\nUltimately, the Ministry found it preferable to respect the expectations of FIT Applicants by allocating the available capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line through a process as close as possible to the ECT process originally provided in the FIT Rules.417 The Ministry thus chose to adopt a regional ECT process which would Include connection point changes and generator paid upgrades. In so doing, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Ministry did not act in a manner that could be deemed contrary to Article 1105.\n\nSue Lo WS II \u00a719; Cronkwright WS II \u00a7\u00a720-21; Chow WS II \u00a78.\n\nc. The process ultimately used to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n637.\n\nThe Claimant also claims that the actual allocation process was \"materially different from the ECT process established in the FIT Rules\" and violated Article 1105.418 in particular, the Claimant\u2019s objections target the following features of the process eventually chosen by the Ministry: the process allowed connection point changes in a wide range of circumstances (1);419 allowed connection point changes between regions (2);420 it allowed enabler requested projects to select a connection point (3);421 it allowed generator paid upgrades (4); it did not include a step to assess the feasibility of expansions to the transmission system (5);422 it established a cap on the capacity that would be procured (6);423 and it allowed for a five day connection point change window (7).424 The Claimant also submits that the 3 June Direction was issued without sufficient advance notice and without consultation (8). Each of these objections is considered in turn.\n\nReply \u00a7685.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7699-703.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7704-707.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7708-711.\n\nReply \u00a7685(b).\n\nReply \u00a7685(a).\n\nReply \u00a7685(c).\n\n1. Connection point changes in a wide range of circumstances\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n638.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the FIT Rules only allowed distribution projects to change connection points prior to an ECT.425 Through the 3 June 2011 Direction, however, this possibility was extended to transmission projects.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7699-703.\n\n639.\n\nIt is correct that the FIT Rules expressly provided that distribution connected projects could change their connection points prior to an ECT.426 However, the FIT Applicants and the OPA did not understand this to exclude transmission projects from the change of connection points. Indeed, in numerous presentations, the OPA conveyed to the FIT Applicants that *all* applicants would be given an opportunity to change their connection points prior to an ECT.427 As an illustration, the OPA presentation of 23 March 2010 provided so in the following language:\n\n\"After an applicant receives a TAT result, they [sic] may request a change of connection point for their project.\"428\n\nExh. C-0258, FIT Rules Version 1.1, ss. 5.3(d), 5.5(b), 5.5(d) and 5.6(b).\n\nExhs. C-0034; C-0088, p. 46 (\"An applicant who has not passed the TAT is able to change their connection point to requiring an enabler\"). See also Exh. C-0405, Ontario Power Authority website excerpt, \"Priority ranking for first-round FIT Contracts posted\" (21 December 2010) (\"FIT applicants will have the opportunity to request a change of connection point prior to the ECT. Connection point changes could impact the ECT outcome for other applicants requesting a nearby connection point.\").\n\nExh. C-0034.\n\n640.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant\u2019s argument that the 3 June Direction Introduced a new process not contemplated in the existing FIT framework by allowing transmission connected projects to change their connection points.\n\n2. Connection point changes between regions\n-------------------------------------------\n\n641.\n\nIn this context, the Claimant contends that the 3 June Direction allowed connection point changes from West of London to Bruce, as a result of lobbying efforts by NextEra.429 According to Mesa, connection point changes should have been allowed from all nearby regions and the fact that changes were limited to the Bruce and West of London region was for NextEra\u2019s benefit.430\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7698, 700 and 722.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7336.\n\n642.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept this line of argument. As was seen above, the FIT Rules always contemplated that applicants could change their connection points431 without regional limitations.432 As Mr. Chow testified, it would make no sense electrically to limit changes to one region only:433\n\n\"At no time did we ever say [that connection point changes during the ECT were to be limited by region] electrically it would have made no sense whatsoever. If an applicant was close to the border of two regions, it would make no sense to prohibit it from changing its connection point to go one way merely because of a line drawn by the OPA solely for planning purposes.\"\n\nChow WS I \u00a7\u00a727, 29; Exh.

(28 October 2014) 151:4-11, 157:11-158:23, 160:1-161:8 (Susan Lo testifying that it would not make sense to limit where a FIT applicant could select a connection point and that connection point changes were always contemplated as part of the ECT); Tr. (28 October 2014) 252:25-255:17, 289:7-11 (Jim MacDougall testifying that the ECT always contemplated connection point changes and that this was the expectation of FIT applicants); Tr. (28 October 2014) 302:22 - 303:11, 307:17-309:1-9 (Bob Chow testifying that the ECT always contemplated connection point changes and this was never limited to within regions; limiting within regions would not make sense from an electrical point of view); Tr. (28 October 2014) 43:14-18, 79:22-80:4, 85:17-21 (Shaun Cronkwright testifying that the Bruce and West of London regions were similar electrically, and that connection point changes were envisioned as part of the original ECT).\n\n643.\n\nIn support of its argument, the Claimant refers to an OPA presentation dated 19 May 2010, which, so it says, provides that connection point changes would only be \"allowed within a region, not between regions.\"434 The presentation makes no such statement.435 in fact, the word \"region\" does not even appear in the presentation.\n\nMem. \u00a7700.\n\nExh. C-0138, OPA Presentation, \"The Economic Connection Test - Approach, Metrics and Process\". See slides 39, 46, 48, and 97 which refer to the option to change connection points but never limiting such change to a transmission region.\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on the word \"region\" as it appears in section 5.1(b) and 5.4(a) of the FIT Rules.436 However, as Mr. Chow testified, those provisions relate to the OPA\u2019s division of the province of Ontario into separate regions for planning and communication purposes. They do not contemplate the division of the province into electrical regions for the purposes of an ECT.437\n\nReply \u00a7704.\n\nChow WS II \u00a7\u00a712-13.\n\n645.\n\nFinally, the Claimant has in any event not established how it was prejudiced by the 3 June Direction limiting connection point changes to projects in the Bruce and West of London regions. Indeed, if projects located outside these two regions had been permitted to connect to these two regions, then the Claimant\u2019s projects would have faced even greater competition.\n\n3. Connection point changes for enabler requested projects\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nThe next objection raised by the Claimant is that the 3 June Direction allowed a proponent who previously asked to be \"enabler requested\"438 to choose a specific connection point, which was not provided in the FIT Rules.439\n\nin their applications, applicants could either indicate a specific connection point, or indicate that they were \"enabler requested\" i.e. that the applicants would pool together with other nearby projects to form an \"enabler\" facility that would itself connect to the grid. See Chow WS I \u00a723; Exh. R-002, FIT Program Overview, v. 1.1, pp. 18-19.\n\nMem. \u00a7722.\n\n647.\n\nThis objection is not well-founded either. While the FIT Rules did not expressly provide for connection point changes for enabler requested projects, there was nothing in the FIT Rules that prohibited them.440 As Jim MacDougall, manager of the FIT Program at the OPA from July 2009 to June 2011 stated in his oral testimony, \"if it is not prohibited then people can do it.\"441 Further, as Canada pointed out, not every aspect of the FIT Program was detailed in the Rules. For Instance, the method of carrying out the ECT Itself was not prescribed in the Rules.442 Moreover, the OPA\u2019s presentations highlighted the possibility for all projects to change their connection points. This was reiterated in the TAT priority rankings of 21 December 2010, which Indicated that all projects listed there would be able to change their connection points without distinguishing between enabler requested projects and others.\n\nMr. Chow\u2019s testimony was to the same effect. See Chow WS I \u00a727; Chow WS II \u00a711.\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 301:16-22 (\"[T]here was no explicit restriction on how connection point changes could be permitted or prohibited or limited. But, in general, with the FIT rules and the FIT contract, if its - if it is not prohibited, then people can do it.\").\n\nExh. C-0258, FIT Program Rules, v. 1.1, s. 5.4 (describing the original FIT Program framework, without providing any details for the running of the ECT).\n\n4. Generator paid upgrades\n--------------------------\n\n648.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that allowing generator paid upgrades as part of the allocation of capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line violated Canada\u2019s obligations under NAFTA.443 The Tribunal notes that generator paid upgrades had always been part of the ECT process.444 Hence, the 3 June Direction Introduced nothing new in this respect. The Claimant\u2019s objection must accordingly be dismissed.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7150, 774-775.\n\nExh. C-0088, Ontario Power Authority Presentation, \"The Economic Connection Test - Approach, Metrics and Process\" (19 May 2010), p. 72; Exh. C-0444, Email from Sue Lo (12 May 2011), p. 2 (stating that including generator paid upgrades in the Bruce-to-Milton allocation would be consistent with the ECT process as it had always been described); Chow WS I \u00a727 (generator paid upgrades were always part of the ECT); Tr. (29 October 2014) 86:3-8 (Shawn Cronkwright testifying that generator paid upgrades were contemplated as part of the original ECT).\n\n5. Feasibility of expansion to the transmission system\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nThe Claimant sees another violation of Article 1105 in the fact that, unlike an ECT, the Bruce to Milton allocation \"did not Include a phase for proposing and assessing new expansions to the transmission system to accommodate additional FIT projects.\"445 it has, however, provided no factual basis or legal arguments in support of this claim. It follows that the Tribunal cannot but dismiss this objection as Insufficiently pled.\n\nReply \u00a7685(b).\n\n650.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal nevertheless notes that the purpose of the second phase of the ECT was to Identify any transmission construction projects that would be worthwhile from an economic perspective.446 The LTEP had already identified the transmission projects which the Government considered to be economically suitable.447 None of these projects were located in the Bruce Region. Indeed, once the Bruce to Milton Line would be in operation, no other transmission project would be economically justified in the region - a fact that was known.448 As a result, the second phase of the ECT would have been unnecessary.\n\nChow WS I \u00a735.\n\nSue Lo WS I, \u00a7\u00a737-40; Chow WS I \u00a737.\n\nChow WS I \u00a747 and Sue Lo WS I \u00a740; Exh.C-0414, Ontario\u2019s Long-Term Energy Plan, p. 31.\n\n6. Cap on the amount of capacity\n--------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nThe Claimant also challenges the Government\u2019s decision to place a cap on the amount of electricity to be procured from the Bruce Region. It contends that the cap was contrary to the expectations of FIT Applicants to whom the Ministry had promised that all available capacity would be awarded.449\n\nC-PHB \u00a7\u00a7172, 338.\n\n652.\n\nThe Tribunal has already explained the changed circumstances which gave rise to the LTEP and the 2011 Supply Mix Directive. These texts required Ontario to procure no more than 10,700 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2018. This target was based on the planned transmission expansion, the overall demand for electricity, and the ability to integrate renewables into the system.450\n\nSue Lo WS I \u00a7\u00a734-36.\n\n653.\n\nOn this basis, on 17 February 2011, the Ministry directed the OPA to plan for a generating capacity of renewable energy amounting to 10,700 MW. Further, in the 3 June Direction, the Government directed the OPA to reserve 750 MW of transmission capacity in the Bruce Region. The figure of 750 MW was based *inter alia* on the renewable energy target laid down in the LTEP, which itself reflected the province\u2019s needs in terms of supply and demand of renewable energy.\n\n654.\n\nThe Claimant also challenges the fact that Ontario only awarded 300 MW of capacity in the West of London region, although 550 MW capacity was available there. For Mesa, if more capacity had been awarded in West of London, \"some high-ranked projects that displaced Bruce region projects would not have switched regions.\" The Claimant, however, has furnished the Tribunal with no evidence in support of this allegation.\n\n655.\n\nTherefore, and in all the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant\u2019s submission that the Ministry\u2019s decision to cap the amount of electricity to be procured from the Bruce Region was in breach of Article 1105.\n\n7. Five day connection point change window\n------------------------------------------\n\n656.\n\nMesa further objects that the connection point change window adopted by the 3 June Direction was a \"sudden, significant, and arbitrary\"451 departure from the established FIT process, a departure that violated Article 1105.452 For the following reasons, the Tribunal has a different assessment of the facts at Issue.\n\nReply \u00a7645.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7645-654, 682-711.\n\n657.\n\nFirst, in respect of the connection point change window process Itself, the FIT Rules specifically provided that projects would have the opportunity to change their connection point prior to an ECT. This was also the understanding of the FIT Applicants at the time, Including the Claimant. In a press release of 23 December 2010, the Claimant acknowledged that it expected that the transmission capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line would be made available to \"all wind projects in the western region of Ontario.\"453 in other words, Mesa was Itself aware that the Bruce to Milton capacity would be available to applicants outside the Bruce Region through a process that would allow applicants to change their connection points. Hence, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant that Ontario\u2019s decision to allocate the Bruce to Milton Line capacity through a regional ECT-llke process was \"arbitrary and unfair.\"454\n\nExh. R-100 (\"All wind projects in the Western region of Ontario are now being considered for ranking because 1,200 MW of additional capacity that will be made available by the Bruce to Milton transmission line will be allocated during the next step, AWA\u2019s Wind Energy Projects Rank High on Canadian Priority List which is the Economic Connection Test (ECT)\").\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7137-163, 645-654, 682-711.\n\n658.\n\nSecond, in respect to the length of the window to change connection points, the Tribunal recalls that, under the original FIT framework, the ECT was to be conducted in August 2010. This process would have Involved a period of three weeks for FIT Applicants to change their connection points. Applicants thus were preparing for this opportunity at least since August 2010.\n\n659.\n\nHowever, for the reasons mentioned above (\u00a7\u00a7621 et. seq.), the Government decided not to conduct an ECT. Applicants nevertheless had an expectation that the Government would permit them to change their connection points prior to allocating capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line. The Canadian Wind Energy Association **(\"CanWEA\")** for instance wrote to the Minister of Energy expressing this expectation in the following terms:\n\n\"CanWEA is writing to express the view of a majority of our members that the Government of Ontario and the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) should follow through with the established Feed in Tariff (FIT) process by immediately opening the window for point of interconnection changes to enable the next round of FIT contracts to be issued in June of this year.\n\nAs you know, developers were told by the OPA on numerous occasions that the opportunity would exist to change their point of interconnections before the running of the Economic Connection Test (ECT) and the awarding of contracts. We are asking that the OPA follow the process and provide this opportunity.\"455\n\nExh. R-113, Letter from Robert Homung, President of CanWEA to the Brad Duguid, Minister of Energy (27 May 2011).\n\n660.\n\nCanWEA further advised the Government that, because the necessary background work had been done, a short window for connection changes would be sufficient:\n\n\"Over the past several months, our members have collectively invested significant time and money to prepare their respective interconnection strategies. Once the updated Transmission Availability Tables are made available our members can be ready to act quickly and respond within the window of time communicated to our members by the OPA. For these reasons, a majority of our members believe the window only needs to be open for a short period of time.\"456\n\n*Id.*\n\n661.\n\nIn line with CanWEA\u2019s representation, the 3 June Direction provided for a short period of five days to change connection points. The Government\u2019s decision to limit the connection point change window appears thus in conformity with the needs of the industry. While the Claimant submits that the CANWEA letter is \"unavailing\",457 CANWEA does represent the interests of several FIT applicants.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7165.\n\n662.\n\nIn fact, while the Claimant objected to the connection point change Itself,458 it did not object to the five-day window at the time. On 2 June 2011, Brian Case, the Director of the TTD and Arran projects, learned about the five-day connection point window through an email message received from an Industry colleague:\n\n\"Connection point change - which the gov\u2019t was contemplating not moving forward with two weeks ago, has made a comeback. The window shall be open for 5 business days beginning next week or the week after as opposed to the 30 days originally outlined.\"459\n\nExh. R-114, Letter from Charles Edey, Leader Resources, to Brad Duguid, Minister of Energy (30 May 2011).\n\nExh. R-186, E-mail from Hari Suthan Subramaniam (GE, Corporate) to Rembrandt Niessen (GE Power & Water), Brian Case (GE Power & Water), Marc A. Rousseau (GE Power & Water), Benjamin Kennedy (GE Power & Water), Simon Olivier (GE Infra, Energy) and Mandar Pandit (GE Power & Water) (3 June 2011). See also Exh. R-184, where on 26 May 2011, Chuck Edey of Leader Resources (an outside consultant who submitted the TTD and Arran FIT applications) wrote to Mr. Robertson, indicating that an \"announcement [was] imminent\" with respect to a change window.\n\n663.\n\nThere is no Indication on record that Mr. Case reacted negatively to this Information.\n\n664.\n\nIn reality, it is not surprising that Mesa did not protest against the shortness of the window at the time. Indeed, a short window reduced the potential for projects outside the Bruce Region to connect Into the region. Hence, rather than being detrimental, if anything this change was beneficial to Mesa\u2019s project.\n\n665.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that, by allowing a five-day connection point change window, the Government did not breach Article 1105.\n\n8. Advance Notice and Prior Consultation\n----------------------------------------\n\n666.\n\nFinally, Mesa contends that the 3 June Direction was Issued with \"Inadequate\" advance notice and without prior consultation, which was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and \"contrary to expectations\",460 thereby breaching Article 1105.461 if the Ministry had followed OPA\u2019s practice of consulting with FIT Applicants, so says the Claimant, \"there may not have been a rule change.\"462 On its part, the Respondent counters that the lack of consultation did not cause any harm to Mesa.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7487.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7311.\n\nC-PHB \u00a7486.\n\n667.\n\nIt is true that the 3 June Direction was issued on a Friday. It notified FIT Applicants that the connection point change window would open for five days from the following Monday, i.e. 6 June. The Respondent\u2019s witness, Mr. MacDougall admitted that this was inadequate463 and Ms. Lo explained that the Ministry was in a hurry to award contracts because of political considerations.464\n\nSee the testimony of Jim MacDougall (Tr. (28 October 2014) 238:18-20 [CONFIDENTIAL]).\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 164-165, 185-186.\n\n668.\n\nBe that as it may, the Tribunal recalls that FIT Applicants were expecting a connection point change window since at least August 2010. The Respondent\u2019s witness Ms. Lo accepted that the connection point change could have been anticipated.465 Moreover, although the decision to allocate capacity in the manner specified in the 3 June Direction appears to have been taken nearly three weeks earlier on 12 May 2011,466 subsequent correspondence between the Ministry and the OPA shows that discussions on the connection point change window were still ongoing on 20 May 2011,467 On 27 May 2011, i.e. just one week before the 3 June Direction, CanWEA informed the Ministry that its members were expecting a connection point amendment window.468 39 applicants actually changed their connection points during the window.469 Furthermore, it is not the Claimant\u2019s case that it was unable to change its own connection points because of the short notice. In other words, the Claimant does not allege that it was prejudiced by the short notice.\n\nTr. (28 October 2014) 164-167.\n\nTestimony of Shawn Cronkwright, Tr. (29 October 2014) 65:5-66:11 (the decision to change connection points was made on 12 May 2011); C-604, Email from Sue Lo (MEI) to JoAnne Butler, 12 May 2011. See also Rej. \u00a7195 (\"it is undisputed that [on 12 May 2011], the decision was taken to go with the modified ECT process following a meeting between the Minister\u2019s Office and the Premier\u2019s Office.\").\n\nExh.

(31 October 2014) 256:21-25.\n\n669.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal finds that the acts complained of here do not rise to the level required for a breach of Article 1105.\n\n670.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant\u2019s various objections in respect of the process adopted by the Ministry to allocate capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line. The Tribunal will now proceed to examine whether the Ministry developed this process in the interest of particular FIT Applicants.\n\nii. Benefit to particular FIT Applicants\n----------------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nThe Claimant submits that because of \"Irrelevant considerations arising from electioneering, politicization, or favoritism\", other applicants to the FIT Program Including NextEra Energy and International Power Canada received better treatment than Mesa,470 thereby depriving the Claimant of a FIT Contract which otherwise it would have been awarded.471 For the Claimant, on the basis of advance Information, its competitors caused the Ministry to modify the FIT framework in their favor and to Mesa\u2019s detriment. The Information at Issue was not available generally; in supplying it to certain of its competitors, the Claimant submits that the Respondent acted \"profoundly unfairly.\"472 it summarizes its objections as follows:\n\n\"The Ministry had access to confidential rankings of FIT applicants to see how contracts would be given and how changes would affect applicants.\n\nWith Ontario knowing this Information, one applicant, NextEra, was given access to high level government officials and succeeded in lobbying for a FIT rule change while at the same time receiving prior knowledge of the change. Perhaps most disturbingly, as was revealed at the hearing, blatant protection was afforded to International Power Canada, a Canadian company whose executive leadership at the time was a well-known political backer of the Ontario Liberal government. The result was a capriciously misapplied process contaminated by selective and Improper Investor protection, a lack of minimal due process, and a complete lack of transparency and candor. This culminated in a significant rule change that was decided without any consultation with stakeholders, and literally was given a weekend\u2019s advance notice.\"473\n\nReply \u00a724.\n\nMem. \u00a7916.\n\nReply \u00a758; Claimant\u2019s Submission on *Bilcon* \u00a799(f).\n\nC-PHB \u00a7\u00a715-17.\n\n672.\n\nThe Tribunal has already reviewed the circumstances in which the 3 June Direction was Issued. It has found that the direction was based on rational considerations responding to the situation prevailing at the time in Ontario. The Tribunal cannot discern in this factual matrix the \"patent abuse of governmental and regulatory authority\" alleged by the Claimant. The 3 June Direction may have favored a few applicants, but that was the outcome of the rational policy adopted by the Government, a policy and an outcome that the Tribunal does not fault.\n\n673.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence presented by the Claimant in support of its allegations that the 3 June Direction and the accompanying changes in the FIT Rules \"systematically benefited\" NextEra, and were \"specifically designed with NextEra in mind\".474 it comes to the conclusion that the Claimant has not been able to establish its case, which relies largely on conjecture. In the following paragraph, the Tribunal will address the most relevant evidence cited by Mesa in support of its case and explain why such evidence does not substantiate the Claimant\u2019s allegations.\n\nSee, for example, Mem. \u00a7\u00a7688, 697, 719, and 721.\n\n674.\n\nThe Claimant first points to a \"dry run\" which the OPA conducted, in the course of deciding which of the three proposals to follow for allocating capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line.475 As this test showed that only one NextEra project would receive a FIT Contract under this approach, so argues the Claimant, the Ministry chose a different approach, i.e. the regional ECT eventually followed, to ensure that specific proponents, including NextEra, would be favored.476\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7152-155.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7156-163, 645-654, 682-711.\n\n675.\n\nIt is correct that the OPA conducted a dry run to determine the capacity that would be awarded as part of the Bruce to Milton allocation if the preferred approach were that of a special TAT. The reason why the Government eventually chose the regional ECT has already been explained above. The choice was dictated by the fact that the special TAT required an amendment of the FIT Rules and would have been contrary to the expectations of the FIT Applicants.\n\n676.\n\nThe Claimant has not established that the decision not to follow the special TAT process was motivated by an intention to benefit NextEra. The Claimant has not established either that the results of the dry run were known to NextEra. Nor are there indications on record allowing the Tribunal to reasonably infer that NextEra exerted influence on Ministry officials to induce them to adopt a specific process. Indeed, it appears that the results of the dry run were shared only with certain Ministry officials, and not with any of the individuals who allegedly influenced Ministry officials.477\n\nExh. C-0448; Bruce Scenario Analysis, Table of Results (13 April 2011); Cronkwright WS II \u00a719.\n\n677.\n\nIn support its arguments, the Claimant also refers to several alleged meetings between Ministry representatives and NextEra, explaining particularly that NextEra had advance notice of the Ministry\u2019s decision to alter the process for allocating capacity on the Bruce to Milton Line and of the 3 June Direction.478 Specifically, it cites a meeting held on 11 May 2011 between NextEra\u2019s Senior Vice President Al Wiley and Andrew Mitchell, Director of Policy at the Ministry of Energy. It alleges that after that meeting a decision was taken to amend the capacity allocation process on the Bruce to Milton Line in a manner that would favor NextEra.479 It is correct that on the day following the meeting with NextEra, the Ministry appears to have decided to adopt the regional ECT approach Instead of the special TAT process. However, as mentioned earlier, subsequent correspondence between the Ministry and the OPA shows that discussions on the connection point change window were still ongoing on 20 May 2011.480\n\nMem. \u00a7\u00a7721,725, and 726.\n\nReply \u00a7\u00a7781, 147, 318.\n\nExh. R-112 (correspondence between Ms. Lo at the Ministry and Mr. Cronkwright at the OPA).\n\n678.\n\nThe fact that NextEra representatives met with Ministry officials does not in and of Itself lead to the conclusion that the Ministry\u2019s decision and the 3 June Direction were the product of that meeting. As several witnesses confirmed, officials from the Ministry and the OPA regularly met with numerous FIT Applicants throughout the relevant period.481 Indeed, the email relied upon by the Claimant in support of its argument merely demonstrates that no decision had been made yet on the connection point change window.482 While the Claimant has certainly proven that meetings were held between NextEra and the Ministry, it has not established that the content of these meetings differed in any relevant manner from the many meetings which the Ministry conducted in the normal course with Investors in the FIT Program.\n\nSue Lo WS I \u00a7\u00a753-54; Chow WS I \u00a7\u00a749-59; MacDougall WS I \u00a7\u00a730-49. See also WS Lo I \u00a753 (\"if someone requested a meeting, it was part of my job to meet with them\").\n\nSee PHB fn. 412 relying on an email exchange between Ministry of Energy and NextEra (Exh. C-0090) and stating that the facts contained therein were not notified to other FIT applicants. However, that exchange merely notes the discussions at the Ministry at the time \"a decision has not been made yet on whether or not to open the POI [point of interconnection] amendment window, and whether, if so, to do so province-wide or just for Bruce-to-Milton and West of London.\"\n\n679.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that because NextEra made significant changes to its connection points within the five-day window, the Tribunal should assume that it had prior knowledge of the 3 June Direction. As was established earlier, the FIT Applicants were expecting a connection point change since at least August 2010. They knew their FIT provincial priority ranking as well as the connection points of every project since 21 December 2010.483 Thus, applicants had all the Information needed to determine whether to change their connection point484 and do the necessary preparatory work. In November 2010, Ortech, a consulting firm in Ontario, advised FIT Applicants that the connection point change window would be limited and that projects in need of assistance on such change should initiate the process early.485 Moreover, in the absence of any convincing evidence, the Tribunal cannot simply assume that NextEra had advance notice of the 3 June Direction because it changed its connection points during the five-day change window.\n\nExh. C-0405, Ontario Power Authority website excerpt, \"Priority ranking for first-round FIT Contracts posted\", (21 December 2010).\n\nChow WS I \u00a7\u00a729-33.\n\nExh. R-098, Ortech Newsletter \"Heads Up For Ontario ECT Projects\" (November 2010).\n\n680.\n\nThe Claimant has made several other unsupported allegations. For instance, it submits that the 3 June Direction was intended to favor NextEra because \"around the time of the June 3, 2011 rule changes\", NextEra made \"the maximum donation amount permitted under Ontario law\" to the governing Liberal Party.486 it also argues that NextEra \"gained assistance through the Ontario Premier\u2019s office\" and that \"the Minister of Energy\u2019s Office took explicit steps to ensure the process was being executed to the benefit of NextEra\", citing to an irrelevant meeting note. None of these allegations is supported by cogent evidence. In the circumstances, the facts so alleged have simply not been established.\n\nReply \u00a7778.\n\n681.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mesa also claims that the Respondent breached the full protection and security component of Article 1105. It pleads that \"the obligation of full protection and security, which is an integral part of NAFTA 1105, requires Canada to exercise due diligence that the treatment of the investor by the OPA does not undermine the protection of a stable, transparent, non-arbitrary regulatory framework.\"487 The facts invoked for this claim are the same as those considered above. As a result, the Tribunal cannot but dismiss this claim as well.\n\nMem. \u00a780.\n\n682.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Canada\u2019s conduct has not breached Article 1105. While reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal nevertheless notes that at least some criticism may be levelled at Ontario\u2019s decision to run two renewable energy programs in parallel without clearly articulating the relationship of the two and without spelling out their interaction in the event of shifts in demand and supply and other changes in the energy market. In the event, this choice and the manner in which it was implemented created certain problems, and might well have been handled differently. But judged in all the circumstances, this is not criticism that reaches the threshold of a violation of Canada\u2019s international obligations.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A.** Background\n-----------------\n\n683.\n\nAs mentioned above (\u00a7\u00a7189-190), the Parties filed cost submissions on 3 March 2015 **(\"Claimant\u2019s Costs Submission \", \"Respondent\u2019s Costs Submission\")** and replies on 26 **March** 2015 **(\"Claimant\u2019s Reply on Costs\"** and **\"Respondent\u2019s Reply on Costs \").**\n\n**B.** Positions of the Parties\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n684.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"Canada\u2019s conduct has caused unjustifiable inefficiencies in these proceedings resulting in longer delays and increased workloads for both the Investor and the Tribunal. In these instances, costs should be assessed against Canada to address actions that imposed unnecessary burden on the Tribunal and the Investor.\"488 The Claimant therefore requests the Tribunal to order the Respondent to bear the costs of this arbitration, as well its costs of legal representation and assistance, which together amount to US$ 9,306,156.02.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on Costs \u00a74.\n\n685.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that even if it were not to prevail on any claim, it should still be awarded the costs it has incurred on account of \"Canada\u2019s conduct and vexatious argumentation\".489 in particular it points to Canada\u2019s failure to produce documents in a timely manner and to the \"meritless\" subsidy defense advanced by Canada. It quantifies these costs as 30% of its overall legal fees, i.e. US$ 2,791,847.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Submission on Costs \u00a757.\n\n686.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that there are several reasons why, even if it is eventually unsuccessful, it should still not have to bear Canada\u2019s arbitration or representation costs. it stresses that several aspects of its claim were novel and that there was no unreasonable or wasteful conduct on its part.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n687.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Mesa\u2019s claims were speculative, unreasonable and based on a \"meritless interpretation of the NAFTA\".490 For these reasons and to provide reparation to Canada and dissuade similarly frivolous and meritless claims, the Respondent should be granted all of its costs in this arbitration.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs \u00a79.\n\n688.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant pursued the arbitration in an \"Inefficient and needlessly complex way that [...] wasted time and money\".491 in particular, it points out that the Claimant \"(1) failed to respect NAFTA\u2019s 6-month cooling-off period, (2) engaged in unauthorized and excessively burdensome fishing expeditions for documents, (3) Ignored the Tribunal\u2019s rulings and procedures on confidentiality, (4) filed unnecessary and duplicative procedural requests, (5) consistently disrespected the Tribunal\u2019s rules on the number of submissions permitted on procedural requests, (6) sought to prejudice Canada with untimely, last-minute submissions of exhibits, (7) failed to clarify whether it was continuing to pursue certain claims based on measures of the [OPA], (8) presented circular arguments on the nature of the FIT Program that led to unnecessary disputes, and (9) conducted unnecessary cross-examinations on Irrelevant Issues at the hearing.\"492\n\n*Id.* \u00a710.\n\n*Id.*\n\n689.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Tribunal should award the Respondent all of its costs in this arbitration. These Include its arbitration costs and its costs for legal representation and assistance, the latter of which amount to CAD 6,109,001.95.\n\n**C.** Analysis\n---------------\n\n690.\n\nThe Tribunal will first detail the arbitration costs and the costs Incurred by the Parties (1). it will then set out the applicable legal framework (2) and determine the apportionment of costs (3).\n\n**1. Costs**\n------------\n\n691.\n\nThe Claimant has made advances towards costs in the amount of CAD 1,116,000 and the Respondent in the amount of CAD 1,116,000, which gives a total advance of CAD 2,232,000 (equivalent to EUR 1,551,343.80 as converted to Euros upon receipt by the PCA).\n\n692.\n\nThe rates for time spent by the Tribunal and Secretary on this case were set in \u00a723.1 of PO 1 (USD 550 per hour for the Arbitrators and USD 280 per hour for the Secretary, all exclusive of VAT). Computed at these rates, and as converted to Euros for payment by the PCA, the fees of the members of the Tribunal amount to: The Honorable Charles N. Brower EUR 317,369.32; Toby Landau, QC EUR 221,758.57; and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler EUR 508,153.14. The fees of the Secretary of the Tribunal amount to EUR 211,899.78. Accordingly, the total fees accrued for the Tribunal and the Secretary (which are hereby fixed pursuant to Article 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules) amount to EUR 1,259,180.81. Compared to the time actually spent, these fees were reduced in order not to exceed the advance available after the last call. The PCA will shortly provide the Parties with a final statement of account.\n\n693.\n\nThe PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 37,455 for the administration of the case and its registry services. Other costs amount to EUR 254,707.99.\n\n694.\n\nThe total costs of the proceedings are thus EUR 1,551,343.80.\n\n695.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance amount to US$8,518,585.47493 while the Respondent\u2019s costs amount to CAD 6,109,001.95. Considering the complexity of these proceedings, both these amounts appear reasonable.494\n\nThis is the total amount of costs claimed by the Claimant (US$ 9,306,156.02) less the \"fees paid to the Tribunal\" (US$ 787,570.55).\n\nThe Claimant agrees that the Respondent\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance are reasonable. See Claimant\u2019s Reply on Costs \u00a711 (\"The number of hours of legal work provided by both parties is relatively similar and reasonable given the complexity of these proceedings. Similarly, the costs for expert witnesses are similar and reasonable in the circumstances\".).\n\n**2. Applicable Legal Framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n696.\n\nArticle 1135(1) of the NAFTA provides that a NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal may award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. As mentioned above, the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules apply in the present proceeding.\n\n697.\n\nArticle 38 of these Rules provides that the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. It also provides a list of Items that may be claimed which Include the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the reasonable costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party.\n\n698.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules contains rules for the allocation of costs:\n\n\"1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking Into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking Into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\"\n\n**3. Allocation of Costs**\n--------------------------\n\n(a) Arbitration Costs\n---------------------\n\n699.\n\nArticle 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall \"in principle\" bear all of the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant too agrees that, in general, costs should follow the outcome of the case.495\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on Costs \u00a73.\n\n700.\n\nThe Respondent has prevailed in the present proceedings and the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the general rule set in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Indeed, it finds it fair and appropriate that the Claimant bear the entire costs of the arbitration, i.e. EUR 1,551,343.80.\n\n(b) Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance\n------------------------------------------------\n\n701.\n\nUnlike the position on arbitration costs, the UNCITRAL Rules do not contain a presumption for awarding costs of legal representation and other party costs to the successful party. Rather, they provide that in apportioning these costs, the arbitral tribunal should consider \"the circumstances of the case\". Doing so, NAFTA tribunals have taken several factors Into account Including an overall view of the case, the novelty of the case, and the parties\u2019 conduct throughout the case.496\n\nSee, for instance, *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Award in Respect of Costs, 26 November 2002, \u00a717 (Investor\u2019s Reply Statement of Costs Schedule of Documents at Tab-01); *S.D. Myers v. Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Final Award (concerning the apportionment of the costs between the Disputing Parties), 30 December 2002, \u00a749 (Investor\u2019s Statement of Costs Schedule of Documents at Tab-01); *Azinian* \u00a7\u00a7125-126.\n\n702.\n\nHere, each Party complains of the conduct of the other which, so each says, led to an Increase in costs. Each of them also provides explanations to justify its own conduct complained of by the other.\n\n703.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Claimant advanced a large number of procedural requests in the course of this arbitration. While it was its right to do so, many of these requests unnecessarily burdened the arbitral process and were decided against the Claimant.497 Further, many \"confidential\" and \"restricted access\" designations applied by the Claimant and contested by the Respondent were later voluntarily withdrawn.498 The Claimant also filed proceedings under Section 1782 of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in various U.S. courts before the constitution of the Tribunal (but after the filing of its Notice of Arbitration). It also sought to make additional Section 1782 requests while the arbitration was ongoing. All of this created a number of procedural difficulties that might have been avoided.\n\nSee, for instance PO 4 in which the Tribunal rejected the Claimant\u2019s request to amend the procedural calendar on the basis that the Claimant had failed to make our any compelling reason to revisit the calendar that had been previously adopted; PO 6, PO 11 in which other procedural requests made by the Claimant were rejected.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it challenged 458 confidentiality designations made by the Claimant, of which 210 designations were voluntarily withdrawn by the Claimant (Respondent\u2019s Statement of Costs \u00a718). The Claimant has not denied this submission.\n\n704.\n\nAt the same time, it is true that the matters in controversy were genuinely complex and that Mesa\u2019s claims raised in part difficult factual and legal issues, the outcome of which was uncertain. In other words, this was a legitimate dispute.\n\n705.\n\nTaking all of these aspects into account, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant should bear all of its own costs, and 30% of Canada\u2019s costs in an amount of CAD 1,832,701.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n706.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\ni. Decides that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought in the present proceedings, excluding the claims for breaches that occurred prior to the Claimant\u2019s investment in Canada;\n\nii. Decides that these claims are admissible;\n\niii. Decides that, by reason of Articles 1108(7)(a) and 1108(8)(b) of the NAFTA, the Claimant\u2019s claims under Articles 1102, 1103 and 1104 of the NAFTA must be dismissed;\n\niv. Decides that the Respondent has not acted in breach of Article 1105 of NAFTA;\n\nv. Fixes the costs of the arbitration at EUR 1,551,343.80;\n\nvi. Decides that the Claimant shall bear 100% of the arbitration costs fixed in the preceding paragraph and thus orders the Claimant to pay CAD 1,116,000 to the Respondent within 30 days of notification of this award;\n\nvii. Decides that the Claimant shall bear 30% of the Respondent\u2019s costs and thus orders the Claimant to pay CAD 1,832,701 to the Respondent within 30 days of notification of this award;\n\nviii.
