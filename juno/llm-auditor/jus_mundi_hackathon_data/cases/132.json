INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty, which entered into force on April 16, 1998 (the \"**ECT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Eskosol S.p.A. *in liquidazione* (\"**Eskosol**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), a company incorporated in the Italian Republic. The respondent is the Italian Republic (\"**Italy**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). Eskosol and Italy are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\"; their respective representatives are identified above on page (i).\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute arises from a series of measures adopted by Italy that allegedly affected Eskosol's investments in a 120 megawatt photovoltaic energy project in Italy. At the time Eskosol started its project, photovoltaic plants in Italy were subject to a regulatory framework that guaranteed fixed payments (feed-in tariffs or \"**FITs**\") for a duration of 20 years for qualifying projects. According to Eskosol, in spite of the guarantees offered to attract investments, Italy \"abruptly and drastically\" altered the terms under which investors could benefit from FITs, depriving Eskosol of such incentives and destroying its investment in violation of Italy's obligations under Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.1\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 and 70 *et seq*.\n\n4.\n\nThe merits of such allegations are not the subject for today. This decision concerns a preliminary matter, namely Italy's application - submitted on November 18, 2016 - for dismissal of all of Eskosol's claims on the grounds that they are \"manifestly without legal merit,\" pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn December 9, 2015, ICSID received Eskosol's Request for Arbitration of the same date (the \"**Request**\"), and on December 22, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n6.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the Tribunal, by letter of March 14, 2016, Eskosol requested that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Prof. Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil (Argentine) accepted his appointment as arbitrator by Eskosol, and on April 6, 2016, Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy (French) accepted his corresponding appointment as arbitrator by Italy. By letter of June 1, 2016, Eskosol requested that the President be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. On June 21, 2016, ICSID circulated a ballot for President. Prof. Dupuy subsequently withdrew his acceptance of his appointment, effective June 25, 2016, and the ballot for the President was duly suspended. Prof. Brigitte Stern (French) thereafter accepted her appointment as arbitrator by Italy on August 1, 2016.\n\n8.\n\nBy email of August 2, 2016, Eskosol informed ICSID that it was in communication with Italy about a new method of constitution and asked that the ballot for appointment of the presiding arbitrator not be resumed. By email of August 10, 2016, Eskosol informed ICSID that the Parties expected to reach an agreement on the method by August 16, 2016, and by email of August 12, 2016, Eskosol further reported that the Parties had so agreed. Pursuant to the agreed method, the co-arbitrators were to select a candidate by September 12, 2016; should they be unable to reach a decision or should no candidate be confirmed within two weeks of that date, either Party could opt to renew the request for appointment under Article 38.\n\n9.\n\nOn September 13, 2016, Professors Tawil and Stern informed ICSID that on September 12, 2016, they notified the Parties of their selection of Mr. Neil Kaplan to serve as President in the proceedings. On September 15, 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Kaplan was unavailable to serve as presiding arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn September 20, 2016, Eskosol invoked Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and requested that ICSID initiate a new ballot procedure for appointment of the Tribunal President. On October 1, 2016, ICSID circulated a ballot to the Parties and invited them to submit their completed ballot forms by October 7, 2016. By letter of October 7, 2016, ICSID confirmed its receipt of Eskosol's ballot and requested that Italy return its ballot as soon as possible. By email of October 10, 2016, Italy informed the Centre that it intended to return its ballot by October 12, 2016. By letter of October 12, 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that the ballot had been successful, and that it would proceed to seek the acceptance of Ms. Jean Kalicki (U.S.) to serve as President. Ms. Kalicki accepted her appointment as President on October 19, 2016.\n\n11.\n\nOn October 19, 2016, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal therefore was deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nFollowing certain correspondence with the Parties regarding their availability, on November 2, 2016, ICSID confirmed that the first session with the Parties would be held by teleconference on December 2, 2016.\n\n13.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, Italy filed an \"Objection for Manifest Lack of Legal Merits\" pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules (the \" **Objection** \"). The Parties thereafter filed certain proposals with regard to the briefing schedule for the Objection, with the common principle that written submissions would not be completed until after the first session, and a one-day hearing for oral argument was requested.\n\n14.\n\nOn December 2, 2016, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by teleconference in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), during which *inter alia* certain agreements were reached regarding the briefing schedule for the Objection. Pursuant to such agreements, on December 23, 2016, Eskosol filed its \"Response to Respondent's Article 41(5) Objection\" (the \"**Response**\").\n\n15.\n\nOn January 4, 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the agreed schedule for the jurisdictional and merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Italy filed its \"Reply on Rule 41(5) Objection\" (the \"**Reply**\"). On February 1, 2017, Eskosol submitted its \"Rejoinder to Respondent's Rule 41(5) Objections\" (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn February 8, 2017, the Tribunal held a hearing at the World Bank in Paris regarding the Objection. Attending the hearing were:\n\nTribunal Members\n\n\u2022 Ms. Jean Kalicki, President of the Tribunal  \n\u2022 Prof. Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, Arbitrator  \n\u2022 Prof. Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator\n\nICISD Secretariat\n\n\u2022 Mr. Francisco Abriani, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nOn behalf of the Claimant\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ricardo E. Ugarte, Winston & Strawn  \n\u2022 Mr. Marco Pocci, Winston & Strawn  \n\u2022 Mr. Alejandro I. Garcia, Winston & Strawn  \n\u2022 Mr. Stefano Scotti, Winston & Strawn  \n\u2022 Ms. Janet Hyun Jeong Kim, Winston & Strawn  \n\u2022 Mr. Giuseppe Spagnolo, Spagnolo & Partners\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent\n\n\u2022 Mr. Giacomo Aiello, Avvocatura Generale dello Stato  \n\u2022 Ms. Maria Chiara Malaguti, Ministerio degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale (Consultant)\n\nCourt reporter\n\n\u2022 Ms. Claire Hill\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the Parties' respective submissions carefully and in their entirety.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n19.\n\nFor purposes of the pending Rule 41(5) application, it is neither necessary nor appropriate for the Tribunal to make findings of fact. However, for relevant background, the Tribunal notes the following allegations of fact presented by the Parties.\n\n**A. The Underlying Dispute**\n-----------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Eskosol S.r.l. was established on December 21, 2009, by its shareholders, including a Belgian company Blusun S.A. (\"**Blusun**\") (which at the time held a 50% equity stake) and four Italian nationals, Messrs. Vittorio Sisto, Roberto Scognamiglio, Luigi Dante and Gilberto Brana (each of whom at the time held a 12.5% equity stake). Blusun in turn was owned by two individuals, Messrs. Jean-Pierre Lecorcier, a French citizen, and Michael Stein, a German citizen. Eskosol was established as a limited liability partnership (in Italian, \"*Societ\u00e0 a responsabilit\u00e0 limitada*\" or \"*S.r.l.*\") with a corporate capital of \u20ac10,000.2\n\nRequest, \u00b6 38.\n\n21.\n\nOn December 17, 2010, the partners in Eskosol S.r.l. increased the company's capital to \u20ac7,500,000. Blusun increased its equity in the company to 80%, with Messrs. Sisto and Scognamiglio each retaining a 10% equity.3 On December 29, 2010, Eskosol S.r.l. was transformed into an Italian joint stock company (in Italian, \"*Societ\u00e0 per Azioni*\" or \"*S.p.A.*\") and registered with the Italian Business Register - Company Registration Office.4 From December 2010 to the present, Blusun has remained the owner of 80% of Eskosol's shares.5\n\nIbid., \u00b6 47; Exhibit C-2, pp. 3-4.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 48; Exhibit C-2.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 6; Exhibit C-2, p. 3.\n\n22.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Eskosol was intended to be the company under whose umbrella a number of solar photovoltaic (\"**PV**\") power plants were to be planned, developed, built and connected to the national grid. It argues that, as the project company, Eskosol was to channel monies into any companies under its umbrella, enter into agreements with third parties, hire personnel and be a point of contact with Italian authorities.6\n\nRequest, \u00b6 39.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it made a number of investments in relation to the development of a solar energy generation project in Italy comprising 120 solar PV power plants.7 Eskosol allegedly devoted approximately \u20ac38.5 million to the planning, construction and operation of the plants.8 Between May 18, 2010 and July 26, 2010, Eskosol acquired 100% shareholding in 12 special purpose vehicle companies (collectively, the \"**SPVs**\"), which resulted in the availability to Eskosol of all permits, rights, entitlements and infrastructure necessary for it to bring the plants into operation within a time frame of less than one-and-a-half year.9\n\nIbid., \u00b6 40.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 40.\n\n24.\n\nAfter the acquisition of the SPVs, Eskosol started work on the installation of a 150 to 180 kilometer private network of medium voltage electrical cables that was to connect each of the Eskosol plants to two dedicated medium to high-voltage substations.10 The substations were built by an entity named Societ\u00e0 Interconnessioni Brindisi S.r.l. (\"**SIB**\").11 On December 29, 2010, Eskosol entered into an engineering, construction and procurement agreement (the \"**EPC Contract**\") with Siemens S.p.A. (\"**Siemens**\") for the construction and commissioning of the plants.12\n\nIbid., \u00b6 44.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 46.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 52.\n\n25.\n\nOn March 3, 2011, the Italian government issued Legislative Decree No. 28 (the \"**Romani Decree**\").13 The Romani Decree limited the scope of the FITs then in force to those plants that entered into operation within roughly two months from its date of publication, while establishing that those plants that entered into operation after that date but before March 28, 2012, would receive a reduced FIT under then unknown terms and conditions.14 According to the Claimant, this measure resulted in the decision of financial investors to withdraw their support to the Eskosol project. The adoption of the Romani Decree also allegedly led to the suspension of work on the plants, thus making completion in accordance with the timing set out in the EPC Contract unfeasible.15\n\nIbid., \u00b6 56.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 57(1) and 57(2).\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 59-61 and 64.\n\n26.\n\nOn May 5, 2011, Italy's Ministry of Economic Development approved \"**Conto Energia IV**\" (or the \"**Fourth Energy Account**\")16 which reduced the FITs then in force.17 According to the Claimant, due to these various developments, there was a risk that Eskosol would receive no FITs at all.18\n\nPublished in the Italian Official Gazette on May 12, 2011. See Request, \u00b6 63.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 63.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 64.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Eskosol Project became economically unviable as a result of these measures, and Eskosol had no alternative but to abandon its project. It was unable to pay its debts and was declared insolvent and placed under receivership on November 12, 2013.19 Eskosol's bankruptcy receiver is Mr. Teodoro Contardi,20 who has the power to institute proceedings on behalf of Eskosol, as a matter of Italian law.21\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 9, 65-69; Exhibit C-2, p. 3.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 9; Exhibit C-2, p. 4.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 9; Exhibit C-5.\n\n**B. The** ***Blusun*** **Case**\n--------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn February 21, 2014, ICSID registered an arbitration against Italy brought by Blusun and Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein (the \"***Blusun*** **case**\" and the \"***Blusun*** **claimants**,\" respectively).22 The pleadings in the *Blusun* case have not been made available for this Tribunal's review, but it appears undisputed that the case involved the *Blusun* claimants' investments in Italy through Eskosol, and challenged various measures including the two that are at issue in this case, the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account.23\n\nRequest, \u00b6 112; *Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3.\n\n*Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Award of December 27, 2016 (excerpts), Exhibit RL-021, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 321, 331-343 (***Blusun award***).\n\n29.\n\nEskosol asserts that the *Blusun* claimants initiated and litigated that case without consulting with Eskosol itself or with its bankruptcy receiver.24 Eskosol further asserts that the *Blusun* claimants have not cooperated with Eskosol's insolvency proceedings.25\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 122.\n\n*Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Application Under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) of June 21, 2016, Exhibit R-003, \u00b6 9.\n\n30.\n\nWhen Eskosol filed its Request in this case on December 9, 2015, it acknowledged the pendency of the *Blusun* case, but stated that \"[t]he present claim is distinct and separate from that being pursued\" by the *Blusun* claimants.26 Eskosol asserts that it asked ICSID to consolidate this case with the *Blusun* case, but the request was denied.27\n\nRequest, \u00b6 112.\n\nHearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, at 107:12-20.\n\n31.\n\nSubsequently, on June 21, 2016, Eskosol filed an application in the *Blusun* case under Arbitration Rule 37(2) for leave to file a written submission as a non-party. Eskosol explained that it had initiated this case against Italy on its own behalf, that this case \"arise[s] from the same factual matrix and adverse measures that are at issue in the *Blusun* arbitration,\" and that the claims advanced by the *Blusun* claimants were of an \"abusive nature.\"28 Eskosol asserted that \"the *Blusun* Claimants appear to be attempting to abuse these proceedings by seeking damages to which only Eskosol is entitled,\" which would cause prejudice to Eskosol, its creditors and its minority shareholders.29 It affirmed that the *Blusun* claimants \"have no authority to represent Eskosol's interests\" in the *Blusun* case, but nonetheless were attempting to obtain compensation \"for all of Eskosol's losses... without the intent to channel these moneys into Eskosol so Eskosol can reimburse any such payments to the Eskosol Creditors.\"30\n\n*Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Application Under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) of June 21, 2016, Exhibit R-003, \u00b6 1.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 5.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 17, 36.\n\n32.\n\nBy the time Eskosol's Rule 37(2) application was filed in the *Blusun* case, the written phase of that case apparently had concluded, as had the evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction and the merits except for closing arguments.31 On June 30 and July 1, 2016, Italy and the *Blusun* claimants apparently each filed observations on Eskosol's request.32 On July 8, 2016, the arbitral tribunal in that case, composed of Judge James Crawford AC (President), Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov (appointed by the *Blusun* claimants) and Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy (appointed by Italy) (the \"***Blusun*** **tribunal**\"), apparently denied Eskosol's Rule 37(2) application.33 This Tribunal has not been provided with a copy of the procedural order explaining that decision, nor with the observations on the application filed by either Italy or the *Blusun* claimants.\n\nICSID website, https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/cases/casedetail.aspx?CaseNo=ARB/14/3 (describing procedural steps in the *Blusun* case).\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid. (referencing Procedural Order No. 5).\n\n33.\n\nThe *Blusun* tribunal thereafter proceeded to issue its final award on December 27, 2016 (the \"***Blusun*** **award**\").34 From the limited excerpts of the *Blusun* award that have been made available for this Tribunal's review,35 it appears that the *Blusun* tribunal denied the claims on the merits, finding *inter alia* that the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account (a) did not violate various provisions of the ECT, and (b) in any event were not the operative cause of the failure of the underlying project in Italy.36\n\nReply, \u00b6 15; Blusun award, Exhibit RL-021.\n\nItaly contends that it is restricted by confidentiality obligations agreed in the *Blusun* case from submitting the full Award to this Tribunal. During the hearing, Italy stated that its confidentiality obligations contained exceptions permitting use of material if necessary for Italy's defense, on which basis it selected excerpts as \"narrowly as needed\" for submission at this stage of this case. Hearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, 134:16-21. Italy also stated that it would be permitted to submit the full award if this Tribunal ordered it to do so. Hearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, 134:5-6.\n\nBlusun award, Exhibit RL-021, \u00b6\u00b6 343, 394.\n\n**IV. THE RULE 41(5) STANDARD**\n-------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nAlthough the Parties disagree on application of the Rule 41(5) standard to the circumstances of this case, they largely agree on the basic elements of a Rule 41(5) inquiry (\"manifestly without legal merit\"). This precludes the need for the Tribunal to engage in extensive analysis of that standard.\n\n35.\n\nFirst, the Parties agree that Rule 41(5) pertains only to legal defects, including those involving either jurisdiction or the merits, but not to factual defects.37 This does not mean that factual *premises* of claims may not be acknowledged in order to understand the essence of the legal claim asserted. Italy emphasizes that \"the fact that a legal impediment is raised does not mean that no discussion of facts could be required,\"38 and relies on the decision in *Trans-Global v. Jordan* for the proposition that \"it is rarely possible to assess the legal merits of any claim without also examining the factual premise upon which that claim is advanced.\"39 Eskosol agrees that some discussion of facts may take place, but emphasizes that it should not be necessary to conduct an \"in-depth inquiry into the facts of a case\" in order to appreciate the legal defect,40 and that \"a significant factual inquiry is inappropriate under Rule 41(5).\"41\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b615-16; Response, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11; Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\nReply, \u00b6 10.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 11 (quoting *Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25, Decision on the Respondent's Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008, Exhibit CL-003, \u00b6 97 (***Trans-Global v. Jordan***)).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 8 (quoting the *Practice Notes for Respondents in ICSID Arbitration*, ICSID (2015)).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 12.\n\n36.\n\nIn any event, the Parties agree that the Tribunal at this stage should not engage in any assessment of *disputed* facts. Eskosol contends that for Rule 41(5) purposes, \"the facts as alleged by the claimant are taken at face value unless they are frivolous,\"42 and that \"preliminary objections that require the tribunal to determine the contested factual issues, fall outside of the scope of this provision.\"43 Italy appears to accept this proposition, as it asserts that \"[a]ll impediments raised by Italy are legal in nature, not factual,\"44 and that the factual predicates for its objections are all either undisputed,45 or \"come from the exhibits submitted by the Claimant with the Request for Arbitration\"46 or from excerpts provided from the *Blusun* award.47 In its view, therefore, its Rule 41(5) objections \"do[] not require any in-depth inquiry into the facts of the case.\"48\n\nIbid., \u00b6 15 (citing *Trans-Global v. Jordan*, Exhibit CL-003, \u00b6 105).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 11. Eskosol relies on the drafting history of Rule 41(5) as well as decisions rendered with respect to Rule 41(5) in several ICSID cases. *See* Response, \u00b6 11 (citing Lars Markert, \"Summary Dismissal of ICSID Proceedings,\" (2016) 31 ICSID Review 690, 702, Exhibit CL-22, and ICSID, Suggested Changes to the ICSID Rules and Regulations (2005), Exhibit CL-21), and Response, \u00b6 13 (citing *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd v.

See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 13.\n\n38.\n\nThe Parties do present different visions of the extent of analysis that may be appropriate for a tribunal to reach its decision that claims are manifestly without legal merit.\n\n39.\n\nItaly contends that \"although... the respondent must establish its objection clearly and obviously, the exercise to decide upon the matter might require some level of sophistication, as it is often the case in investment proceedings.\"53 In making this statement relating to the meaning of \"manifestly,\" Italy relies on the following passage from the decision in *Trans-Global v. Jordan* :\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these legal materials confirm that the ordinary meaning of the word requires the respondent to establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch. The standard is thus set high. Given the nature of investment disputes generally, the Tribunal nonetheless recognises that this exercise may not always be simple, requiring (as in this case) successive rounds of written and oral submissions by the parties, together with questions addressed by the tribunal to those parties. The exercise may thus be complicated; but it should never be difficult.54\n\nItaly further relies on the decision rendered in *Global Trading v. Ukraine*, in which it claims the tribunal \"discussed both factual evidence and complex legal issues\" to reach a conclusion on the legal merits of the claim.55\n\nReply, \u00b6 20.\n\n*Trans-Global v.

Ukraine***).\n\n40.\n\nBy contrast, Eskosol emphasizes that precisely because the legal defect must be \"obvious or plain *on its face*,\" the tribunal \"should not need to undertake a significant effort to conclude that such a defect exists.\"56 It argues that \"a number of tribunals have concluded that a Rule 41(5) objection should be dismissed if deciding the challenge would require resolving novel, complex or difficult legal issues.\"57 Eskosol relies on the following passage from *PNG v. Papua New Guinea* :\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, a case is not clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious if the Claimant has a tenable arguable case. Rule 41(5) is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts.58\n\nResponse, \u00b6 17 (emphasis added). Eskosol relies, in particular, on the following decisions: *Trans-Global v. Jordan*, Exhibit CL-003, \u00b6 84 and 88; *Global Trading v. Ukraine*, Exhibit RL-003, \u00b6 35; *Brandes v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-002, \u00b6\u00b6 62 and 63; *Elsamex, S.A. v.

Eskosol contends that this standard explains why very few Rule 41(5) applications have succeeded. It argues that it is appropriate and necessary to apply a high standard at this juncture, because an unsuccessful Rule 41(5) applicant will have the opportunity to renew its objections as a later stage of the proceeding, while a successful Rule 41(5) application would deprive a claimant of its claim without a full hearing and opportunity to be heard. Response, \u00b6 10.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts both propositions, which it does not believe are in tension with one another. Investment proceedings do involve a level of sophistication and the fact that the parties may consider it appropriate to brief legal objections at some length, in order to ensure an appropriate context for assessment, does not in and of itself render the objections too complex for resolution under the \"manifest\" standard. At the same time, the Rule 41(5) procedure is not intended, nor should it be used, as the mechanism to address complicated, difficult or unsettled issues of law.\n\n**V. ITALY'S FOUR RULE 41(5) OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nWith this (largely shared) understanding of standards applicable to a Rule 41(5) analysis, the Tribunal turns below to Italy's objections.\n\n43.\n\nItaly presents four separate grounds for its application that the Tribunal dismiss Eskosol's claims for manifest lack of legal merit:\n\na. Eskosol cannot be considered \"a national of another Contracting State\" under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, because on the date it submitted its request for arbitration, it no longer was under \"foreign control\" by virtue of Blusun's majority shareholding, but rather was under the control of a bankruptcy receiver in Italy and an Italian bankruptcy court;59\n\nb. Eskosol does not qualify as an \"investor\" under either the ECT or the ICSID Convention, because in terms of its \"material qualities,\" it was no more than the instrumentality in Italy for Blusun and Blusun's own shareholders;60\n\nc. Under Article 26(3)(b)(i) and Annex 1D of the ECT, Italy declined to consent to arbitration of a dispute previously submitted to another forum, and this limitation on consent bars jurisdiction here in light of the prior initiation of *Blusun* case, which Italy describes as a \"parallel proceeding[] with perfect identity of object and cause\";61 and\n\nd. Public international law principles prohibit the prosecution of multiple claims in relation to the same prejudice, and preclude the opening of a new proceeding on a dispute that previously was submitted to another international arbitration tribunal (*lis pendens*),62 or actually was decided by such a tribunal (*res judicata* or collateral estoppel).63\n\nObjection, \u00b6 9.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 10.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 11.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 13.\n\nReply, \u00b6 53.\n\n44.\n\nEskosol argues that none of Italy's objections satisfy the requirements of Rule 41(5), because they \"demand a significant factual inquiry\" and \"raise novel or complex legal issues.\" Eskosol also asserts that more fundamentally, the application should fail because the objections \"lack merit under any standard,\" not only the \"extremely onerous\" standard set forth in Rule 41(5).64\n\nResponse, \u00b6 4.\n\n**A. Eskosol's Nationality and the Notion of \"Foreign Control\" Under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Italy's position***\n-------------------------\n\n45.\n\nItaly starts from the proposition that pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, access to ICSID arbitration is available for investors that are a \"national of another Contracting State,\" meaning a State *other* than the host State.65 Italy also notes that Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention expressly forbids individual investors from bringing a claim against their own State.66\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 26.\n\n46.\n\nItaly acknowledges that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention extends access to arbitration, in certain circumstances, to local companies established in the host State. Article 25(2)(b) provides that for purposes of Article 25(1), a \"[n]ational of another Contracting State\" means:\n\nany juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\nItaly construes this provision as allowing \"a foreign investor and the host State to agree that the local company, established in the host state by a foreign investor in order to make the investment, may be considered, because of foreign control, as a national of another Contracting State, so that the local entity may have recourse to available ICSID arbitration.\"67 In Italy's view, Article 25(2)(b) constitutes an exception that allows a departure from the principle of incorporation or *si\u00e8ge social* in favor of one based on foreign control.68\n\nIbid., \u00b6 28. See also \u00b6 27.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 28.\n\n47.\n\nRelying on the decision on jurisdiction rendered in *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela,* *C.A. v. Republic of Venezuela*, Italy asserts that Article 25(2)(b) imposes two conditions, both of which must be satisfied autonomously:\n\ni. that \"[t]he parties have agreed to treat the said company as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of [the] Convention\"; and\n\nii. that \"[t]he said company is subject to foreign control\".69\n\nIbid., \u00b6 31. *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5), Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104 (\"***Autopista v. Venezuela***\").\n\n48.\n\nAccording to Italy, both conditions must be assessed at the date of consent to arbitration.70\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 62 *et seq*.\n\n*a. The agreement of the parties*\n---------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nItaly notes that in this case, the only agreement relevant to Eskosol's nationality is the ECT, as \"Italy did not sign any agreement, neither with Eskosol nor with Blusun,\" to treat Eskosol as a national of another Contracting State.71 Italy emphasizes that there is no obligation under Italian law to establish a domestic company to benefit from the incentives for photovoltaic energy production, and that Blusun and Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein \"decided to proceed that way for business reasons\" rather than from any requirements imposed by Italy.72\n\nIbid., \u00b6 33.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 33.\n\n50.\n\nItaly argues that like the ICSID Convention, the ECT was intended solely for the protection of foreign investors, not nationals of the host State,73 and accordingly \"a domestic company is protected under the ECT only as far as its protection amounts in fact to that of the foreign investor.\"74 Italy suggests that Article 26(7) of the ECT should be read in this context.75 Article 26(7) provides as follows:\n\nAn Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State.\"\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, citing ECT Article 26(1).\n\nIbid., \u00b6 38.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 39.\n\n51.\n\nItaly contends that by virtue of this passage, it \"only agreed to accept that a locally incorporated company be admitted to an ICSID arbitration as a means to protect the interests of a foreign investor, not to protect those of national investors.\"76 In particular, it argues, Article 26(7) cannot be construed as agreeing to allow a locally incorporated company the right to access ICSID arbitration after it has entered into receivership, because from that date forward, the local entity effectively is under the control of its receiver and the Italian bankruptcy courts, not of its shareholders.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 41. Italy adds that \"Article 26(7) of the ECT establishes an exception for those cases where a foreign investor cannot otherwise receive protection, and to avoid that changes in legal status (for instance because the company has been nationalized or expropriated by the State, and the investor contest[s] the very same measure) jeopardize a consistent application of Article 26.\"\n\n*b. The requirement of \"foreign control\"*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nItaly argues that even if Article 26(7) of the ECT were sufficient to establish an agreement by Italy with respect to foreign control, it still remains necessary to verify independently that foreign control exists, because an agreement between the parties cannot be used to contravene the purpose for which the ICSID Convention was intended.77 With respect to the requirement of an objective inquiry into foreign control,78 Italy relies on *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*79 and *National Gas v. Egypt*.80 As the *National Gas* tribunal explained:\n\nThe objective test is raised by the words \"because of foreign control\"; and it is not met simply by meeting the subjective test: these two tests are not the same. As was decided in *Vacuum Salt*, \"[...] the parties' agreement to treat Claimant as a foreign national \u2018because of foreign control' does not *ipso jure* confer jurisdiction. The reference in Article 25(2)(b) to 'foreign control' necessarily sets an objective Convention limit beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist and parties therefore lack power to invoke same no matter how devoutly they may have desired to do so [...]\"[\u00a7 36].... Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that this objective test is not satisfied by mere agreement of the Parties in this case: \"foreign control\" must be established objectively.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 45.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 42-43 (quoting *Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. V. Government of the Republic of Ghana* (ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1), Award, 16 February 1994, RL-010, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 (***Vacuum Salt v. Ghana***) for the proposition that \"in addressing the present claim of jurisdiction grounded on the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) it is the task of the Tribunal thus to determine whether or not the Convention limit has been exceeded. In undertaking this task the Tribunal first must ascertain where that Convention limit lies.\").\n\nObjection, \u00b6 45 (quoting *National Gas S.A.E. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/7, Award, 3 April 2014, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6 133 (***National Gas v. Egypt***).\n\n53.\n\nItaly acknowledges that the ICSID Convention itself contains no definition of \"foreign control,\" and that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Convention suggest an intent to provide considerable discretion in this respect to the agreement of the parties. However, Italy quotes this passage from *Vacuum Salt* for the proposition that such an agreement applies only if it is based on reasonable criteria:\n\nAs the consent of the parties is in broad principle the \"cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\"... it is accorded considerable respect and is not lightly to be found to have been ineffective. Thus the acknowledged authority on the Convention states in specific regard to Article 25(2)(b) that \"any stipulation... based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted\" and that jurisdiction should be declined \"only if... to do so would permit parties to use the Convention for purposes for which it was clearly not intended\" [\u2026] Then it is \"only... where such foreign control cannot be postulated on the facts on the basis of the application of any reasonable criterion that a tribunal... would not [accept jurisdiction], because in such a case the parties would purport to use the Convention for purposes for which it was not intended.\"81\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43 (quoting *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* RL-010, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37) (citations omitted).\n\n54.\n\nItaly observes that \"Article 26(7) ECT refers to '*foreign control*', and not to '*majority of shares*' or '*majority of capital*',\" as do certain Italian BITs that Eskosol invokes as guidance.82 Moreover, while Article 26 itself contains no definition of \"control,\" Italy observes that the ECT parties agreed to the following \"Understanding\" regarding the meaning of \"control\" for purposes of the definition of \"Investment\" under Article 1:\n\nUNDERSTANDING with respect to Article 1(6)\n\nFor greater clarity as to whether an Investment made in the Area of one Contracting Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Investor of any other Contracting Party, control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. In any such examination, all relevant factors should be considered, including the Investor's\n\n(a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment;\n\n(b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment; and\n\n(c) ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or any other managing body.83\n\nReply, \u00b6 32.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 46 (quoting Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, Section IV (\"Understandings\"), \u00b6 3 (\"With respect to Article 1(6)\")); Reply, \u00b6 31.\n\n55.\n\nIn Italy's view, this Understanding clearly states that \"what matters is control *in fact*, to be determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation,\" and that \"substantial influence over the management or operation of the entity is of essence.\"84 Italy suggests that the same type of focus on *actual* control, and not simply control presumed from shareholder status, should govern the objective assessment of foreign control required by the ICSID Convention.85 In Italy's view, \"whereas majority shareholding might be a significant indicator of control, this is precisely because management control in that case is presumed, unless other elements lead to a different conclusion.\"86 Here, as discussed further below, Italy contends that Eskosol's bankruptcy filing is they key element that dictates the result of an \"actual control\" analysis.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 47.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 48 (quoting *National Gas v. Egypt*, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6\u00b6 135-136, regarding the advantages of a \"realistic look at the true controllers\" and a determination where control is \"actually\" exercised).\n\nReply, \u00b6 31.\n\n*c. The date on which foreign control must be established*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nItaly appears to acknowledge that the language of Article 26(7) of the ECT distinguishes, for purposes of access to arbitration by locally incorporated companies, between the date on which the nationality of the company must be established (\"on the date of the consent in writing\") and that on which foreign control must be shown (\"before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises\"). It contends, however, that only *one* date is relevant for purposes of the separate (objective) inquiry into foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention: \"[i]rrespective of the language of the agreement between the parties, the objective conditions of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) ICSID must exist *at the time of consent*.\"87 Italy relies on the following statement by Professor Schreuer:\n\n[F]oreign control must have existed at the time of the agreement. Since the agreement to treat the local company as a national of another Contracting State is closely linked to consent between the parties... the foreign control must have existed at the time of consent.88\n\nObjection, \u00b6 65 (emphasis added).\n\nIbid., \u00b6 66 (quoting C. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009), Exhibit RL-017, p. 329); Response, \u00b6 4.\n\n57.\n\nItaly's position is that \"ICSID lacks competence\" over claims brought by companies that, on the date of consent, are effectively controlled by nationals of the State against which the claim is brought.89 In making this argument, Italy relies on the decisions and awards rendered in *SOABI v. Senegal*,90*Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*,91 and *National Gas v. Egypt*.92\n\nObjection, \u00b6 63.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 63 (quoting *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels (SOABI) v.

Senegal***): \"The Tribunal observes that status as a 'national of another Contracting State' is to be established, in the case of a juridical person, *with reference to the date on which the parties agreed to submit the dispute to the Centre*\") (emphasis added by Italy).\n\nObjection, \u00b6 64 (quoting *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, Exhibit RL-010, \u00b6 35: \"the Tribunal's decision on the matter before it ultimately must turn on *whether or not 'foreign control' as contemplated by the second clause of Article* *25(2) (b) existed as a matter of fact on the date of consent*\") (emphasis added by Italy).\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 67-69 (quoting *National Gas v. Egypt*, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6\u00b6 132-133).\n\n58.\n\nItaly contends that the date on which the Parties consented to ICSID arbitration is the date on which Eskosol submitted the Request, *i.e.* December 9, 2015.93 As discussed below, it argues that on this date Eskosol already was under receivership, and consequently no longer was subject to foreign control.94\n\nObjection, \u00b6 62.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 70.\n\n*d. The facts of foreign control in this case*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nItaly contends that Eskosol has not been controlled by Blusun \"since at least November 2013,\" when it was declared bankrupt,95 because since that date as a matter of Italian law it has been under the control of an Italian judge and an Italian receiver, both appointed by an Italian bankruptcy court.96 Italy explains that pursuant to Articles 31 and 42 of the Bankruptcy Law, \"[t]he Court order [that starts the bankruptcy proceeding] deprives the debtor of the right to manage his business and to dispose of his assets,\" and therefore from that moment, \"[c]ustody and management of assets become the duty of the receiver, who does it under the supervision of the presiding judge and to the satisfaction of the creditors.\"97 In Italy's view, what matters is that because of bankruptcy, the controlling shareholder is deprived of its management powers (both \"regular\" and \"in relation to existing assets\") and consequently has no actual control of the company.98\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 54-56. Italy quotes the relevant Articles as follows:\n\nArticle 31: The receiver has the administration of the bankruptcy estate and performs all the operations of the procedure under the supervision of the Presiding Judge and the Creditors' Committee, within the functions assigned to it. Article 42: The bankruptcy order from the time it is issued *deprives the bankrupt of the right to administer and dispose of the assets in his possession* at the date of the decree (emphasis added by Italy).\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\n60.\n\nItaly further argues that pursuant to Article 146 of the Bankruptcy Law, shareholders lose the power to bring actions on behalf of the company, which in the event of bankruptcy can be initiated only by the receiver, subject to authorization from the judge and after hearing from the creditors' committee.99 In this case, Italy points out that the filing of the Request was authorized by Mr. Contardi, Eskosol's receiver.100\n\nObjection, \u00b6 57 (referencing Bankruptcy Law, Exhibit RL-15, Article 146).\n\nObjection, \u00b6 57; see also Request, \u00b6 9.\n\n61.\n\nOn this basis, Italy contends that the ECT's control inquiry can lead to only one conclusion, because \"power to manage a company is inherent to the concept of control under the ECT.\"101 Because Eskosol's shareholders no longer exercised actual control of the company by the date of consent to ICSID, Eskosol cannot invoke the foreign nationality of such shareholders to establish jurisdiction pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.102\n\nReply, footnote 24.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 58.\n\n62.\n\nIn Italy's view, this conclusion is appropriate to be drawn at the Rule 41(5) stage, because (a) the date of Eskosol's bankruptcy and the contents of Articles 31 and 42 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are undisputed;103 (b) these are the only facts that are relevant to Eskosol's nationality for jurisdictional purposes, as all other issues are a matter of law regarding interpretation of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 26 of the ECT;104 and (c) its objection requires only \"a straightforward interpretation of treaty provisions and their relationships under the general rules of international law on the law of treaties, as well as of general principles of law,\" and the Tribunal can make a decision with the instruments at its disposal at this stage of the procedure.105\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 13.\n\nReply, \u00b6 23.\n\n***2. Eskosol's position***\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nEskosol argues that it \"has standing *ratione personae* within the terms of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention as a result of the application of Article 26(7) of the ECT.\"106 In its view, under Article 26(7) of the ECT \"an ECT Member State consents to an arbitration filed by its own nationals when the following requirements are met\":\n\n(a) The claimant-investor is a juridical person;\n\n(b) The claimant-investor had the nationality of the respondent State at the time of giving consent in writing to ICSID arbitration; and\n\n(c) Before its dispute with the respondent State arose, the claimant-investor was controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party.107\n\nResponse, \u00b6 23.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 27.\n\n64.\n\nEskosol asserts that there is no dispute that requirements (a) and (b) are met in this case. Regarding the third requirement, it contends that Italy's argument that Eskosol was under Italian control from November 2013 through the time of consent is meritless for a number of reasons.108\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n65.\n\nFirst, Eskosol argues that this objection \"cannot be deemed to be *manifestly* without legal merit, when assessment of [it] requires this Tribunal to delve into complex issues of local and international law.\"109 Indeed, Eskosol argues that Italy's objection invites the Tribunal to evaluate (i) Italian bankruptcy law, and (ii) whether this law \"causes Eskosol to lose its status as a 'foreign controlled' entity\" under Article 26(7) of the ECT.110\n\nIbid., \u00b6 30.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 30; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 69-73.\n\n66.\n\nEskosol further argues as follows:\n\ni. \"the requisite agreement that Eskosol shall be treated as a national of another Contracting State on the basis of foreign control exists by virtue of Article 26(7) of the ECT\";111\n\nii. ownership is a valid criterion to assess the existence of \"foreign control\";112 and\n\niii. the relevant date to establish consent is the date when the dispute arose.113\n\nResponse, \u00b6 25.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 31 and 34-43.\n\n67.\n\nEskosol's arguments are summarized in turn below.\n\n*a. The agreement of the parties*\n---------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nEskosol contends that \"enabling provisions just like Article 26(7) of the ECT have been deemed by a plethora of international tribunals to constitute an 'agreement' as to foreign control within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"114 Eskosol relies on a series of decisions including *Levy v.

The requirement of \"foreign control\"*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nEskosol contends that whatever the date on which foreign control is assessed (as of when the dispute arose or at the time of consent), Eskosol would satisfy the requirement as a straightforward consequence of Blusun's continued majority shareholding,119 because ownership is a valid criterion for demonstrating foreign control.120 It argues that in the absence of a definition of \"foreign control\" in either Article 26(7) of the ECT or Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, \"the determination as to whether foreign control exists depends on the circumstances of each case.\"121 Eskosol notes, however, that \"it is clear from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* that the ICSID Convention does not require a foreign entity to exert 'effective control' for 'foreign control' to be found.\"122\n\nIbid., \u00b6 49.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 44.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 44.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 52 (citing *Autopista v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113).\n\n71.\n\nEskosol rejects Italy's proposal to use \"a test that focuses on the 'management' of the company in the ordinary business sense, when the company is in receivership.\"123 It asserts that the \"management\" of a company's liquidation can hardly equate to the management of a company in regular operation.124 In its view, \"a receiver administers or manages the bankruptcy *estate* rather than the company itself,\" and \"[a]s the company has ceased to trade, there is no management of the company as such.\"125 Eskosol contends that \"[w]hen all is about monetising assets, all that is relevant in the company is represented by the entitlement that the owners of the company have to receive what remains after debts are paid,\" and therefore \"the only relevant criterion to determine control of the bankrupt company can be majority ownership.\"126\n\nResponse, \u00b6 45.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 45; Rejoinder, \u00b6 57.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 57.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 59.\n\n72.\n\nEskosol asserts that \"a bankruptcy order under Italian law does not affect a company's ownership. Blusun remains a majority shareholder of Eskosol, and shareholders in an S.p.A. continue to enjoy significant prerogatives,\" including \"the right to bring an end to Eskosol's bankruptcy proceedings by concluding an agreement with Eskosol's creditors and to oppose Eskosol commencing these proceedings.\"127\n\nResponse, \u00b6 46; see also Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 63-65 (citing Articles 124 and 36 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law).\n\n73.\n\nEskosol also argues that shareholding is a reasonable criterion for assessing foreign control. According to Eskosol, Italy \"widely accepts majority ownership as the sole criterion for determining control of a company for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in its own investment treaty practice,\" including in the BITs concluded with Albania, Barbados, Indonesia, and Jamaica.128 It notes that the tribunal in *Levy v. Peru* also concluded that majority shareholding satisfies the requirement of control under Article 25(2)(b).129\n\nResponse, \u00b6 47; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 39 and 67 (citing Albania-Italy BIT, Exhibit CL-031, Article 8(2)(c); *Burimi v.

Peru*, Exhibit CL-024, \u00b6 171).\n\n74.\n\nMoreover, Eskosol argues, allowing it to have access to ICSID arbitration \"is perfectly consistent with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT.\"130 To the contrary, it asserts, Italy's position regarding the interpretation of foreign control is inconsistent with the purpose of the ICSID Convention for the following reasons:\n\n- the present dispute is not domestic in nature. The claim belongs to Eskosol as a company (and not to the receiver or the bankruptcy judge), Eskosol's cause of action arises precisely because of its foreign ownership and control,131 and it would be \"absurd for Eskosol's standing here to rise or fall depending on the nationality of officers (receiver and supervisory judge) appointed to oversee its bankruptcy\";132\n\n- the purpose of the ICSID Convention would be fulfilled by the Tribunal upholding jurisdiction. Italy already has received a significant investment because of Eskosol's project and should not be permitted to ignore the rights granted under Article 26(7) of the ECT, which according to Eskosol are granted to it as a company, independently from the rights of its shareholders;133 and\n\n- it would be aberrant for Italy to be able to shut the door on Eskosol's claim on the basis of a bankruptcy that Eskosol alleges ultimately was caused by Italy.134 Italy's theory that bankruptcy divests shareholders of control for purposes of ICSID jurisdiction would provide \"a powerful incentive to cause and procure [\u2026] the bankruptcy of every local company that meets the requirements of Article 26(7) of the ECT before it commences an ICSID claim against it.\"135 Moreover, even if certain qualifying shareholders in a local company could seek recovery under their own names for reduction in value of their shareholding, a rule that prohibits the local company from suing in its own name, on account of its bankruptcy, would enable Italy \"to secure a windfall by not having to pay compensation to non-qualifying minority shareholders.\"136\n\nResponse, \u00b6 50.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 43.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 50.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 44.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 45.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 46.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 46.\n\n75.\n\nFinally, Eskosol adds that to the extent Italy's position on the date and content of a foreign control test would result in Eskosol's having no remedy whatsoever under the ECT - \"thus, depriving its *substantive* rights of all content\" - then \"Eskosol would seek to rely on the most-favoured-nation (MFN) clause contained in Article 10(7) of the ECT by reference to the Italy-Barbados BIT, in particular its Article 9(6).\"137 Article 9(6) of that BIT provides consent for ICSID access by local companies \"in which before such a dispute arises the majority of shares [are] owned by nationals\" of the other State.138 Under this provision, Eskosol asserts, \"it is plain that an Italian company under bankruptcy, but majority owned by Barbadian nationals at the time of consent to arbitration will be afforded access to ICSID and, in Italy's (apparent) view, access to the substantive protections in the BIT.\"139\n\nIbid., \u00b6 68.\n\nIbid., note 59 (quoting Barbados-Italy BIT, Art. 9(6), Exhibit CL-032).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 68.\n\n*c. The date on which foreign control must be established*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn any event, Eskosol contends, Italy's Rule 41(5) objection rests on a mistaken view of when foreign control must be established. In Eskosol's view, Italy's claim that this control must exist at the time of consent is meritless.140 Rather, Eskosol asserts, the relevant date for determining whether an investor is under foreign control is the date when the dispute arose, because \"Article 26(7) [of the ECT] expressly provides that the date on which such foreign control must exist is 'before a dispute... arises'.\"141 It notes that there is no dispute that Eskosol was controlled by a Belgian entity, Blusun, before this dispute arose.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 34 *et seq*.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 31.\n\n77.\n\nEskosol disagrees with Italy's contention that jurisdiction would depend on a finding that the ECT's provision on the applicable date somehow supersedes the test under the ICSID Convention, because in fact, \"there is nothing in ICSID Article 25 that needs to be superseded.\"142 Article 25(2)(b) is silent on the meaning and date of \"foreign control,\" and nothing in the ICSID Convention suggests that \"foreign control\" over a local company must exist at the time of consent.143 In other words, according to Eskosol, the critical date to which Italy agreed in the ECT does not violate any mandatory provision providing otherwise in the ICSID Convention.144\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 29.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 29.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n78.\n\nEskosol argues that the authorities on which Italy relies are inapplicable to this case.145 In particular, it states that: \"(1) None of the cases cited by Italy deals with the ECT and the agreement on foreign control in that specific treaty; and more importantly, (2) none of the cases concerned an objection raised by the respondent State based on the timing of foreign control.\"146\n\nResponse, \u00b6 35.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 31.\n\n79.\n\nWith respect to Italy's reliance on *SOABI v. Senegal*, for example, Eskosol asserts that it relates to an agreement that said nothing about the date when foreign control must exist. In Eskosol's view, \"this decision does not state that foreign control must exist at the time of consent to ICSID arbitration\"; it \"merely stands for the proposition that verification of the existence of an agreement on foreign control (which could have been concluded at an earlier time) should be conducted at the time of consent.\"147\n\nResponse, \u00b6 36.\n\n80.\n\nEskosol also rejects Italy's reliance on *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, on the following grounds: (a) the arbitration clause was embedded in a contract between a local company and the host State \"and not a provision that is similar to Article 26(7) of the ECT\";148 (b) in that case there was no separate agreement on foreign control, and the only moment at which the tribunal could assess the existence of foreign control was when the parties concluded their agreement containing an ICSID clause;149 and (c) the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia* \"warned against the use of the tribunal's findings in *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* to thwart the effects of an agreement on foreign control.\"150\n\nIbid., \u00b6 38.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 39; Rejoinder, \u00b6 32.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 40 (quoting *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, Exhibit CL-26, note 237: \"In *Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v. Republic of Ghana*, Award of February 16, 1994... the tribunal noted that '[t]he reference in Article 25(2)(b) to \"foreign control\" necessarily sets an objective Convention limit beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist and parties therefore lack power to invoke same no matter how devoutly they may have desired to do so.'... *Yet, although there is an objective limit, a Tribunal must also remain flexible so as to accommodate the agreement of the parties as to the definition of 'foreign control*.')\" (emphasis added by Eskosol).\n\n81.\n\nRegarding *National Gas v. Egypt*, Eskosol asserts that the award \"does not state that the critical date when foreign control must exist for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) is the date of consent to arbitration.\" Eskosol explains that the issue was never addressed because the local entity was majority owned by an Egyptian national before the dispute arose, which makes this case distinguishable from Eskosol's.151\n\nResponse, \u00b6 43 (citing *National Gas v. Egypt*, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6 7); Rejoinder, \u00b6 32.\n\n82.\n\nAs for Professor Schreuer's work, Eskosol argues that Italy's quotes are \"highly selective\" and that his views do not assist Italy. Eskosol quotes the relevant Schreuer passage in full as follows:\n\n[As compared to the first clause of Article 25(2)(b)] [t]he situation is less clear when it comes to the critical date for the foreign control. During the Convention's drafting, there was some concern about a change of control over the locally established company (History, Vol. II, pp. 287,445) but no definite solution was offered. The Convention's wording is not without ambiguity on this point. The words 'on that date' relate to 'the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute'. But they do not relate to the subsequent words dealing with foreign control. To express this meaning the words 'on that date' would have to be repeated after the words 'because of foreign control'. Therefore, a strictly grammatical interpretation leaves open the question at what time foreign control over the local company must have existed. On the other hand, the agreement to treat the local company as a national of another Contracting State must be 'because of foreign control'. Therefore, foreign control must have existed at the time of the agreement. Since the agreement to treat the local company as a national of another Contracting State is closely linked to consent between the parties [\u2026], the foreign control must have existed at the time of consent.152\n\nResponse, \u00b6 41 (quoting C. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009), Exhibit RL-17, p. 329) (emphasis omitted).\n\n83.\n\nEskosol submits that this quote \"is not on point\" for the following reasons: (a) Prof. Schreuer was discussing the contents of Article 25(2)(b) as applied to arbitrations arising from agreements concluded between investors and host States, not in respect of investment treaties and certainly not the language of Article 26(7) of the ECT; (b) the passages omitted by Italy reveal that Professor Schreuer considered the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) to be far from clear; and (c) and Italy's reading of Professor Schreuer's conclusion is not supported by the text of Article 25(2)(b).153\n\nResponse, \u00b6 42.\n\n84.\n\nIn Eskosol's view, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention \"make plain that States have significant leeway to determine whether to treat a national as a national of another Contracting State under Article 25(2)(b),\" and once that determination is made, such as under Article 26(7) of the ECT, it is entitled to significant deference.154 Eskosol relies for this proposition on analyses of the Convention's drafting history,155 and on the reasoning of the tribunal in *Autopista v. Venezuela*.156\n\nIbid., \u00b6 42.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 23 (citing ICSID, *History of the ICSID Convention* (1968) Vol II-1, Exhibit CL-030, p. 580, \u00b6 109) and \u00b6 24 (quoting ICSID R65-11, \"Memorandum from the General Counsel and Draft Report of the Executive Directors to accompany the Convention,\" in *History of the ICSID Convention* (1968) Vol II-2, Exhibit CL-046, pp. 957-958, \u00b6 29: \"Clause (b) of [Article 25(2)], which deals with juridical persons, is more flexible [than Article 25(2)(a)]. A juridical person which had the nationality of the State party to the dispute would be eligible to be a party to proceedings under the auspices of the [ICSID] Centre if that State had agreed to treat it as a national of another Contracting State because of foreign control.\").\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 25 (quoting *Autopista v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6 97: \"In reliance on the consensual nature of the Convention, they [the drafters of ICSID] preferred giving the parties the greatest latitude to define these terms themselves, provided that the criteria agreed upon by the parties are reasonable and not totally inconsistent with the purposes of the Convention.\").\n\n***3. The Tribunal's analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by observing that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes jurisdiction over \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a *national of another Contracting State,* which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre\" (emphasis added). This principle of diversity of nationality is subject to a specific exception reflected in Article 25(2)(b), which includes within the definition of a foreign national \"any juridical person which had the *nationality of the Contracting State party* to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and which, *because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State* for the purposes of this Convention\" (emphasis added).\n\n86.\n\nFor purposes of the first clause of Article 25(2)(b), it is undisputed that Eskosol is a juridical national of Italy. It is equally undisputed that Eskosol was so \"on the date on which the parties consented to submit\" this dispute to arbitration, namely on December 9, 2015, when Eskosol filed its Request invoking the general offer of arbitration Italy had provided through the ECT. The question presented by Italy's first objection therefore centers on the second clause of Article 25(2)(b), *i.e.,* whether Eskosol is eligible to avail itself of the exception created by that clause in order to proceed in this forum. At this stage of the proceedings, Italy must demonstrate that it is \"manifest\" that Eskosol may not do so, within the meaning of Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n*a. The agreement of the parties*\n---------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe first step in this Article 25(2)(b) inquiry is to assess the nature and scope of the parties' agreement, to determine whether they intended and agreed to treat Eskosol as a national of another Contracting State for purposes of ICSID jurisdiction, and if so, whether such agreement was \"because of foreign control.\" The Tribunal has no difficulty concluding that the requirement of such *subjective* intent and agreement is met in this case. Article 26(7) of the ECT sets forth two requirements, separated by the conjunctive \"and,\" for a host State company to be treated as a qualified foreign national for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Each of these requirements contains an express temporal condition, and those requirements notably differ. First, such company must have the host State nationality \"*on the date of [its] consent in writing*\" to ICSID (emphasis added), which Eskosol - an Italian company - clearly did. Second and independently, the company must be \"controlled by\" investors of another Contracting Party \"*before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises*\" (emphasis added). There is no dispute that prior to and at the time of the two State measures challenged in this case (the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, in March and May 2011 respectively), Eskosol was controlled for all relevant purposes by its 80% shareholder Blusun, a Belgian company. Italy agrees that Eskosol was under foreign control until at least December 2012.157\n\nObjection, \u00b6 49.\n\n88.\n\nNothing in Article 26(7) suggests an additional requirement, namely that the foreign control existing immediately before the dispute arises also must persist through the date of consent. Indeed, the fact that the Article supplies its own express temporal requirement for foreign control, which differs from the date-of-consent requirement for host State nationality, seems to preclude such a reading. Italy does not suggest otherwise.\n\n89.\n\nArticle 26(7) further reflects the clear subjective intention that satisfaction of its two separate requirements would be sufficient also to satisfy the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The provision uses the mandatory word \"shall,\" as in \"[a]n Investor... which has [fulfilled the first requirement] and which [has fulfilled the second requirement], *shall* for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a 'national of another Contracting State'.\" (emphasis added).\n\n*b. The additional objective requirements of Article 25(2)(b)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThis is merely the start of the inquiry, however, because the test for Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention also has an *objective* component that is not necessarily satisfied merely because of the parties' subjective agreement. As other tribunals have found, parties do not have unlimited discretion to define as foreign-controlled an entity that objectively is not, or that objectively is controlled only by nationals of a non-Contracting State.158 An ICSID tribunal therefore must undertake its own review of the facts regarding foreign control, to confirm that control indeed was exercised by a national of the Contracting State.159 Given the importance of the parties' stated intentions as reflected in their agreement, however, a tribunal should not conclude that foreign control objectively is lacking unless there are unusual circumstances that preclude deference to their agreement to \"treat[]\" an entity as so controlled.160 These circumstances would require a finding that the criteria agreed by the parties are simply unreasonable, or that application of such criteria would result in an outcome that contravenes the underlying purposes of the ICSID Convention.161\n\n*Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* RL-010, \u00b6 36 (\"[T]he parties' agreement to treat Claimant as a foreign national 'because of foreign control' does not *ipso jure* confer jurisdiction. The reference in Article 25(2)(b) to 'foreign control' necessarily sets an objective Convention limit beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist and parties therefore lack power to invoke same no matter how devoutly they may have desired to do so\"); *Autopista v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6 104 (describing the existence of foreign control as a \"requirement\" separate from an agreement to treat a company as a national of another Contracting State for purposes of the ICSID Convention); *National Gas v. Egypt*, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6 131 (\"despite its text as one uninterrupted sentence, Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention separately establishes a subjective test and an objective test\"); see also \"Memorandum from the General Counsel and Draft Report of the Executive Directors to accompany the Convention,\" in *History of the ICSID Convention* (1968) Vol II-2, Exhibit CL-046, \u00b6 24 (\"While consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In keeping with the purpose of the Convention the jurisdiction of the Centre is further limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.\").\n\n*Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* RL-010, \u00b6 36 (\"it is the task of the Tribunal to determine whether or not the Convention limit has been exceeded.\"); *National Gas v. Egypt*, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6 133 (\"The objective test... is not met simply by meeting the subjective test: these two tests are not the same.\").\n\n*Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* RL-010, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38 (\"[T]he consent of the parties... is accorded considerable respect and is not lightly to be found to have been ineffective... [T]he existence of consent... raises a rebuttable presumption that the 'foreign control' criterion of the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) has been satisfied\"); *National Gas v. Egypt*, Exhibit RL-009, \u00b6 134 (\"even as an objective test, the requirement of Article 25(2)(b) as to foreign control may take into account the express agreement of both the disputing parties and the Contracting Parties to the ICSID Convention\").\n\n*Autopista v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6 97.\n\n91.\n\nIn this case, such an inquiry has two necessary components. The first is whether it would be inconsistent either with the text of Article 25(2)(b) or with the purposes of the ICSID Convention to accept jurisdiction based on foreign control connected *to the date a dispute arises* (the ECT test), rather than the date of consent to arbitration. The second is how the existence of foreign control should be evaluated for purposes of the ICSID Convention, and whether it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the ICSID Convention to accept jurisdiction over a claim filed by a local company *after its entry into bankruptcy proceedings* in the host State. For both of these inquiries, the Tribunal applies the standards of Rule 41(5), to determine whether Italy has met its burden of showing that Eskosol's invocation of jurisdiction is \"manifestly without legal merit.\"\n\n*c. The date on which foreign control must be established*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nFor purposes of the first inquiry - whether the ICSID Convention mandates that foreign control still exist on the date of consent - it is necessary to begin with a textual analysis of Article 25(2)(b). As with all treaty provisions, this Article is to be interpreted and applied as instructed by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), meaning \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning\" of its terms, \"in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"162 For ease of discussion, the provision is replicated in full below:\n\n\"National of another Contracting State\" means: \u2026\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Exhibit CL-057.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Professor Schreuer that Article 25(2)(b)'s wording \"is not without ambiguity\" regarding the operative date for foreign control.163\n\nC. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009), Exhibit RL-017, p. 329.\n\n94.\n\nUnder what he calls \"a strictly grammatical interpretation,\"164 it could be said that the phrase \"*and which*\" in the middle of the provision completely separates two requirements, the first addressing host State nationality and the second addressing foreign control. Under this approach, while there is a temporal element specified for the first requirement (\"nationality... on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute\"), there is no temporal element specified for the second requirement, simply a reference to the parties' agreement. This would suggest that the words \"on that date\" do not carry over to the second issue of foreign control, because \"[t]o express this meaning the words 'on that date' would have to be repeated\" in the second clause,165 as in a hypothetical alternative phrasing \"and which, because of foreign control *on that date*, the parties have agreed should be treated..\" The absence of the repeated reference could be said to suggest no intention by the Convention's drafters to mandate foreign control as of the date of consent, instead leaving that temporal issue - like the definition of \"foreign control\" itself - to discussion between the parties.\n\nIbid., p. 329.\n\nIbid., p. 329.\n\n95.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal considers that there is also a contrary argument to be made within the confines of a VCLT analysis, taking into account that treaty provisions also must be interpreted \"in their context,\" which includes the words found in surrounding passages. Article 25(2)(b) operates as an exception to the general principle of diverse nationality established in Article 25(1), and it is well established that the time of consent is the critical juncture for assessing nationality, in order to establish a claimant's *bona fides* as a foreign investor. Consent to arbitration is also the critical juncture for precluding resort to \"any other remedy\" pursuant to the immediately following Article 26. The notion that a \"foreign\" element to the claimant must persist as of the date of consent - be it foreign nationality or foreign control, in the case of locally incorporated companies - could be said to be implicit from the context, as well as the overall object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. Recognizing that fact, it could be deemed sufficient from a drafting perspective that the date of consent was specified once in Article 25(2)(b), without the need that it be specified twice, to connote a requirement that foreign control still must exist as of the date of consent. If this interpretation were adopted, then the question would be whether such an implicit requirement is mandatory for purposes of the Convention, thereby precluding the parties from agreeing to any contrary date for demonstrating foreign control, such as appears to have been done in Article 26(7) ECT by its reference to the time before the dispute arises.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that either interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) could have significant implications for cases involving facts different from this one. First, as Italy contends, an approach that permits the parties to agree to jurisdiction so long as there is foreign control \"before a dispute... arises\" (the language in Article 26(7) of the ECT) could be stretched to imply *at any time before* the dispute; this arguably would enable a local company to invoke ICSID arbitration simply on the basis of some *historic* foreign ownership that had ceased to exist, such as by voluntary sale, well before the State measures that gave rise to the parties' dispute. Even if Article 26(7)'s \"before\" language were read implicitly to mean \"*immediately* before\" or \"*as of the moment*\" a dispute arises - a reading that Eskosol urges166 - dispensing with a requirement that foreign control persist at least through the date of consent could have other consequences. Among other things, it could facilitate the buying or selling of ICSID claims, by recognizing that once a local company owned by a foreign investor has been affected by a State measure, that company would retain standing to sue the State at any time in the future, even after being sold to new owners who are host State nationals with no element of foreign control whatsoever.\n\nHearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, at 139:8-12.\n\n97.\n\nAt the same time, as Eskosol contends, an approach that bars a company from ICSID arbitration because it no longer is foreign-controlled on the date of its request for arbitration - even though it indisputably was foreign-controlled when the dispute arose - could be invoked by States to shield them from challenge for wrongdoing that directly precipitated the loss of control, such as nationalization or a forced sale to third parties. In such circumstances some shareholders still might be able to commence suit in their own names for the value of their lost investment in the local company, but others might not, so the loss of foreign control attributable to State action would become the proximate cause of an inability to collect full reparation for the consequences of the wrongful conduct.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that some of the scenarios thus posited potentially could be addressed through other means, such as the abuse of right doctrine or the maxim that no party should be permitted to benefit from its own wrong. But the fact remains that all interpretations of arguably ambiguous treaty language have potential doctrinal consequences for future cases that should not be lightly ignored. This counsels for caution in interpreting arguably ambiguous treaty text, particularly where the issue presented appears (as it does here) to be one of first impression. At minimum, such exercises should not be attempted at the Rule 41(5) stage, where briefing necessarily has been expedited and the parties have not had a full opportunity to present the potential ramifications of all interpretations. If anything is clear from the parties' briefing of the temporal issue regarding foreign control under the ICSID Convention, it is that the outcome of this theoretical debate is not \"manifest,\" but rather is both novel and complex, and therefore is unsuitable for resolution on a Rule 41(5) application.\n\n99.\n\nIn this case, it would be particularly inappropriate for the Tribunal to reach out to resolve the temporal issue at this juncture, because the Tribunal has serious doubt whether Italy could demonstrate, in any event, a loss of foreign control in Eskosol even as of the date of consent. This issue is addressed separately below.\n\n*d. The alleged loss of foreign control through bankruptcy proceedings*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nItaly's Rule 41(5) objection depends not just on the legal proposition that the ICSID Convention requires foreign control to persist through the date of consent, even where the parties clearly agreed in the ECT that foreign control before the dispute should suffice for purposes of ICSID access. Separately, the success of the objection also depends on the proposition that Eskosol's entry into bankruptcy proceedings following the challenged State measures divested it of the uncontroverted foreign control it enjoyed prior to bankruptcy, by virtue of the Belgian nationality of its 80% shareholder Blusun. In other words, even assuming *arguendo* that Italy's interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) Convention were correct, the requirements of that article still would be satisfied *unless* the Tribunal also accepts Italy's proposition regarding the consequences of Eskosol's bankruptcy filing. But the Tribunal has serious doubts about this proposition, particularly (but not exclusively) within the confines of the \"manifest\" legal defect standard of Rule 41(5).\n\n101.\n\nThe term \"foreign control\" is not defined in the ICSID Convention, and tribunals have concluded that the absence of a definition represented a deliberate choice by the drafters. \"In reliance on the consensual nature of the Convention, they preferred giving the parties the greatest latitude to define these terms themselves, provided that the criteria agreed upon by the parties are reasonable and not totally inconsistent with the purposes of the Convention.\"167 In this case, the ECT text does not define control for purposes of determining whether a local company is \"controlled\" by a foreign investors pursuant to Article 26(7), but the term \"controlled\" also was used in the definition of \"Investment\" in Article 1(6), which refers to \"every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor..\" The Tribunal considers it appropriate to construe the term consistently across these two provisions. The Tribunal therefore gives due weight to the \"Understanding\" adopted by the ECT parties with respect to Article 1(6).\n\n*Autopista v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6 97; see also *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana,* RL-010, \u00b6 37 (quoting Aron Broches for the proposition that \"any stipulation... based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted\" and jurisdiction should be declined \"only if... to do so would permit parties to use the Convention for purposes for which it was clearly not intended\").\n\n102.\n\nAccording to this joint Understanding, \"control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation.\" It is significant that in the non-exhaustive list of three \"relevant factors\" identified in the Understanding, the first listed is \"financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment.\" But at the same time, this is not the exclusive criterion for - and therefore not conclusive proof of - control for purposes of the ECT.168 The Understanding also identifies as the second and third \"relevant factors\" the \"ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment\" and the \"ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or any other managing body.\"169\n\nIn that sense the ECT is different from the Concession Agreement at issue in *Autopista v. Venezuela*, which the tribunal found had adopted a majority shareholding test as the criterion to be applied to determine foreign control. The tribunal found no basis to import a different, \"effective control\" requirement into Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, finding that \"direct shareholding is certainly a reasonable test for control.\" *Autopista v. Venezuela*, Exhibit RL-008, \u00b6\u00b6 112, 117-121.\n\nFinal Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, Section IV (\"Understandings\"), \u00b6 3 (\"With respect to Article 1(6)\").\n\n103.\n\nWith respect to the first identified factor (\"financial interest, including equity interest\"), there is no dispute that that even at the time of the Request for Arbitration, Blusun retained ownership of 80% of Eskosol's shares. As such, Blusun presumably retained a \"financial interest\" in any future value of Eskosol. While the bankruptcy filing indicates that Eskosol's liabilities exceeded its assets at that time, Eskosol alleges that the value of its claims in this proceeding exceed the amount of its liabilities, so that if such claims were to succeed, Eskosol could have residual value to distribute to its shareholders.\n\n104.\n\nAs for the other factors identified in the ECT Understanding, Italy presents no argument to suggest that *prior* to the bankruptcy filing, Blusun did not exercise \"substantial influence over the management and operation\" of Eskosol, nor that it lacked the \"ability to exercise substantial influence\" over the selection of Eskosol's Board members or other managers, so as to fully satisfy the relevant ECT test for control. Rather, Italy's sole objection is that the bankruptcy filing itself *displaced* whatever mechanisms of control existed previously, so that from that date on, \"control in fact\" of Eskosol manifestly resided in the hands *only* of its receiver and the supervising bankruptcy court. This is said to follow from Italian law regarding the powers of a bankruptcy receiver and court. Of course, such powers remain in place only so long as the entity remains in bankruptcy; Italy does not appear to contest Eskosol's argument that its shareholders could choose to infuse additional capital into the company, or strike a direct payment deal of some sort with Eskosol's creditors, to enable it to satisfy its debts and return to operations.\n\n105.\n\nBe that as it may, Italy contends that the mere status of *being in* bankruptcy proceedings is sufficient to divest an entity from foreign control for purposes of ICSID jurisdiction to entertain an ECT claim, even when the entity indisputably was both solvent and under foreign control *prior* to the State measures that it seeks to challenge. The ECT alone would not dictate this result, because (as previously noted) the ECT only seeks to confirm foreign control prior to the dispute. The proposition thus depends on a three-step analysis:\n\n(a) importing the ECT's \"control in fact\" test into the ICSID Convention for purposes of satisfying the Convention's objective requirement of foreign control - or alternatively deeming such an actual control test to be mandatory under the ICSID Convention, so that it must be satisfied even if the parties had agreed to a more formalistic test such as majority ownership;\n\n(b) applying that actual control test on a different date than the ECT itself would (the date of consent); and\n\n(c) crediting Italian bankruptcy law as sufficient to override all presumptions of control that otherwise flow from majority shareholding, such that control of an entity in bankruptcy necessarily resides in the local receiver and local bankruptcy court.\n\n106.\n\nThe latter proposition, regarding the power of a bankruptcy filing to dictate the result of any control analysis, is a far-reaching assertion for which Italy provides no support other than by reference to its own domestic bankruptcy law. But foreign control for purposes of the ICSID Convention is an issue of international law, not domestic law. While the Convention's drafters may have been content largely to defer to the parties to reach their own agreements regarding the facts of control, such agreements must be consistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention, including the protection in appropriate cases of foreign investment. It would not be consistent with the underlying purposes of the Convention to render an otherwise qualified foreign-owned entity suddenly ineligible to access its protections, simply because the entity's liabilities eventually overtake its assets enough to justify (at least temporary) supervision of its activities to protect the rights of creditors. Among other things, this would mean that even in demonstrated cases where State conduct is partially or wholly responsible for the financial straits that led to the bankruptcy (as Eskosol alleges in this case), the State could avoid scrutiny of its acts by virtue of their own consequences, simply by invoking the predictable reality that local bankruptcy proceedings always will be supervised by local courts. But even in less dramatic situations, such as where the bankruptcy is attributable largely to factors other than State action, there still is no logic to divesting the entity of its otherwise applicable right to seek redress for grievances against the State - particularly when doing so might enable it to reverse its financial fortunes enough to emerge from bankruptcy. There is certainly nothing in the ICSID Convention to suggest that implementation of the foreign control requirement for jurisdiction was intended to depend on the financial fortunes or misfortunes of the local entity.\n\n107.\n\nNor is such an intent apparent or even implicit in the multi-faceted test in the ECT Understanding. The factors listed in the Understanding are each in a sense *structural*, deriving either from the distribution of company shares or from the distribution of powers regarding management, operation, and selection of board members, which generally are reflected in a company's foundational documents. While the company's economic fortunes may wax and wane, and certain exigencies may require a resort to bankruptcy protection, there is no suggestion in the ECT Understanding that the possibility of financial misfortune was expected to outweigh a more structural analysis of control, and render an entity *ipso facto* locally controlled, simply because of the necessary supervision of a bankruptcy court.\n\n108.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is unconvinced by Italy's assertion regarding the second necessary component of its first Rule 41(5) objection, namely that Eskosol's bankruptcy filing manifestly deprived it of foreign control prior to filing its Request. This is so even if, for the sake of argument, such continuing foreign control were to be deemed objectively necessary to pursue ECT claims under the ICSID Convention. Italy's first Rule 41(5) objection is therefore denied. Italy of course retains the right to try to convince the Tribunal otherwise at a subsequent stage of this proceeding.\n\n**B. The Claimant as an Investor under the ECT and the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Italy's position***\n-------------------------\n\n109.\n\nItaly's second Rule 41(5) objection is that Eskosol \"lacks the material qualities of an investor,\" because it was not the \"actual investor\" that \"ma[de] the investment\" in Italy as that term should be understood under Article 26 of the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Rather, Italy contends, Eskosol was merely the \"*longa manus*\" or instrumentality of the actual investor, which Italy contends was Blusun and its two shareholders, Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein.170\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 71, 75-76.\n\n110.\n\nItaly argues that it is \"undisputed\" that Blusun invested in Italy by establishing two companies, SIB and Eskosol, the first as a vehicle to connect individual photovoltaic plants to the national electricity grid and the second as a holding company for the 12 SPVs.171 Italy also contends that it is undisputed that Blusun was Eskosol's \"sole controlling shareholder,\"172 that its management was left in the hands of a sole director (one of Blusun's two shareholders), and that it had only one employee.173 Moreover, Italy asserts that even though Eskosol signed the EPC contract with Siemens in its own name, the potential beneficiaries of the FITs were the 12 SPVs, not Eskosol.174 According to Italy, all of these facts \"come from the exhibits submitted by the Claimant with the Request for Arbitration.\"175\n\nIbid., \u00b6 72 and Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\nReply, \u00b6 14.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 73 (citing Ex. C-002, p. 16); Reply, \u00b6 43.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 74.\n\nReply, \u00b6 14.\n\n111.\n\nOn this basis, Italy contends that the Request should be dismissed for Eskosol's lack of the material qualities of an investor.176 Italy argues that it is too \"formalistic\" and \"oversimplistic\" for Eskosol to posit that it qualifies as an investor in Italy solely by reference to its incorporation in that country.177 It asserts that \"[w]hereas the definition of 'investor' usually limits itself to address the issue of nationality, an investor is so only if it makes an investment under the terms of the relevant treaty and in line with its aim and purposes.\"178 Italy clarifies that it does not contend that \"since Blusun was a legitimate investor under the ECT and ICSID, then Eskosol could not also be one.\"179 Rather, its position is that \"from the facts as described in the Request for Arbitration, Eskosol appears to be no more than an instrumentality of Blusun (as well as SIB) to realize the investment in Italy.\"180\n\nObjection, \u00b6 76.\n\nReply, \u00b6 40.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 41.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 45.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 45.\n\n***2. Eskosol's position***\n---------------------------\n\n112.\n\nEskosol states that it qualifies as an \"Investor\" under the definition set forth in Article 1(7) of the ECT, which refers to \"a company \u2026 organized in accordance with the law\" of a Contracting Party, and Eskosol is lawfully incorporated in Italy.181 It notes that Italy does not contest that Eskosol satisfies the Article 1(7) definition, but instead appears to be arguing for an additional implicit requirement that an investor \"make\" an investment or be a \"material\" investor to secure ECT protection. According to Eskosol, there are no such requirements under the ECT, under which protection follows simply from direct or indirect ownership or control of \"every kind of asset.\"182 As for the ICSID Convention, Eskosol notes that it does not contain any definition of \"investor,\" and that while Italy contends that Eskosol does not qualify, it \"fails to cite any provisions of ICSID that would support its argument.\"183\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92 (quoting Article 1(6) of the ECT and citing cases for the proposition that formal incorporation suffices for ECT protection).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 53.\n\n113.\n\nIn any event, Eskosol contends that it has made \"numerous investments in Italy,\" as described in its Request. Italy has offered no evidence to demonstrate Eskosol's allegations to this effect are frivolous, and therefore the latter should be accepted for purposes of a Rule 41(5) objection.184\n\nIbid. \u00b6 52 (referencing paragraph 82 of the Request); Rejoinder, \u00b6 90.\n\n114.\n\nMoreover, Eskosol contends, Italy itself \"relies on numerous assertions of fact, all of which are highly contested and incorrect.\"185 For example, Eskosol deems incorrect Italy's contention that Eskosol was managed by a sole director (Mr. Lecorcier), and indicates that it was managed by a board of directors comprised of Messrs. Sisto, Stein, Scognamiglio and Lecorcier.186 Eskosol also challenges Italy's assertion that Eskosol had no entitlement to the FITs received by the SPVs, because Eskosol owned 100% of the 12 local companies and the FITs \"were to be channeled to Eskosol.\"187\n\nResponse, \u00b6 55.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 55; Rejoinder, \u00b6 77.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 55.\n\n115.\n\nEskosol disputes that its rights of direct access to ICSID can be disregarded by labeling it as Blusun's \"*longa manus.*\" It notes that under Italian law, given its incorporation as an S.p.A., Eskosol is a distinct legal entity with personality separate from its shareholders. It also notes that Blusun was not the only shareholder of Eskosol, 20% of which was owned by Messrs. Sisto and Scognamiglio, who contributed money and significant expertise in Italy's banking and renewable energy sectors.188 Eskosol complains that Italy provides no evidence to the effect that Eskosol is not independent from Blusun, but instead tries \"to shift the burden of proof onto Claimant\" by asserting in the Reply that \"there is no ground to establish that only 100% controlled companies would act in full control of their controlling shareholder when bare facts prove to the contrary.\"189\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 57-58; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 77 and 86-92.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 88; Reply, \u00b6 44.\n\n116.\n\nEskosol also rejects what in its view appears to be the underlying premise in Italy's argument, namely that if Blusun is permitted to prosecute ECT claims based on its investment in Eskosol, then Eskosol cannot also bring claims as an investor in Italy.190 In its view, the fact \"[t]hat Eskosol may qualify as both an 'Investment' and an 'Investor' under the ECT, does not deprive Eskosol of its own rights under the ECT.\"191 Indeed, Eskosol asserts that:\n\nArticle 26(7) of the ECT also refers to the locally incorporated company as 'an investor' that has the nationality of the Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of consent, and it emphasizes that the dispute at issue is between the *locally incorporated company* and the Contracting State, and not between a foreign entity and the Contracting State.192\n\nIn Eskosol's view, these references highlight that locally incorporated companies themselves enjoy rights under the ECT, distinct from any rights enjoyed by their shareholders.193\n\nResponse, \u00b6 59.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 59.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 82 (emphasis added by Eskosol).\n\nIbid., \u00b6 83.\n\n117.\n\nEskosol finally contends that this objection would require \"a significant inquiry into factual issues\" regarding Italian law and the circumstances of the *Blusun* case, which are not proper for resolution under Rule 41(5).194\n\nResponse, \u00b6 60.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nItaly's second objection is premised on the notion that even though (a) Eskosol meets the ECT's definition of an \"Investor\" in Article 1(7), and (b) is a local company alleged to be foreign controlled for purposes of Article 26(7) of the ECT (subject to Italy's first objection), the Tribunal nonetheless should decline to recognize Eskosol as a qualified investor under the ECT or the ICSID Convention, because it (c) allegedly lacks certain \"material qualities\" as such an investor. Italy does not attempt to define what those \"material qualities\" are, but its references to the \"actual investor\" that \"ma[de] the investment\" and provided most of the financing suggest it may be advocating for an implicit source-of-capital requirement, in order for a claimant to be considered qualified to invoke investment protection.195 Alternatively, Italy's emphasis on Eskosol's having only a single employee suggests it may be advocating for a requirement that a claimant have some threshold level of substance in operation, beyond mere legal form.196 It is not clear whether Italy urges a \"checklist\" approach to such factors, or a more holistic analysis that takes a variety of issues into account for determining the \"materiality\" of an investor. Regardless of the answer, Italy cites no specific provisions of either the ECT or the ICSID Convention to support such an exercise. Instead, Italy appears to argue that they are implicit in the notion of being an \"investor,\" which must be given some substantive - and not merely \"formalistic\" - content.197\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 72, 75; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 73 (citing Ex. C-002, p. 16); Reply, \u00b6 43.\n\nReply, \u00b6 40.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that in the analogous context of the definition of an \"investment,\" many tribunals have found the ICSID Convention to require some scrutiny of alleged investments to ensure that they actually have certain typical characteristics of such. There is not full consensus regarding the list of such characteristics, nor whether each (or only some) are required to constitute a valid investment. But the general notion that the word \"investment\" must be given *some* substantive content, and not constitute a mere label that can be applied at will to *any* form of economic activity, is broadly accepted.198\n\nSee generally E. Gaillard and Y. Banifatemi, \"The Long March Towards a *Jurisprudence Constante* on the Notion of Investment,\" Chapter 8, in M. Kinnear *et al.* (eds), *Building International Investment Law: The First 50 Years of ICSID* (Kluwer Law International 2016).\n\n120.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Italy's argument may be seen as advocating an extension of this notion from the definition of \"investment\" to the definition of \"investor,\" such that a certain threshold of material characteristics should be deemed implicit and therefore appropriate for tribunal scrutiny. Whether this is so is an interesting question, but it clearly is not one that can or should be resolved at the Rule 41(5) stage of a case. Italy does not even contend that there is settled jurisprudence on the issue, such that a tribunal - even on an undisputed factual record - could find a given entity to \"manifestly\" lack certain required \"qualities\" as a matter of law. Moreover, it appears that the factual record here is not undisputed, making the question even less appropriate for a Rule 41(5) decision. The objection is therefore denied.\n\n**C. Consent Under the ECT to Multiple Related Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Italy's position***\n-------------------------\n\n121.\n\nItaly argues that the consent provided in the ECT did not extend to the initiation of a new arbitration proceeding involving what it describes as \"perfect identity of object and cause\" with the prior *Blusun* case.199 In Italy's view, the consent in Article 26 of the ECT is subject to the limitation established in Article 26(3)(b)(i), which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nThe Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under paragraph (2)(a) or (b).200\n\nParagraph (2)(a) refers to proceedings before \"the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute,\" while paragraph (2)(b) refers to proceedings in accordance with a \"previously agreed dispute settlement procedure.\" As Italy is one of the States listed in Annex 1D, it is entitled to invoke the limitation of consent set forth in Article 26(3)(b).\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 113.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 81-82 (citing ECT, Exhibit C-1, \u00b6 26).\n\n122.\n\nItaly argues that \"the dispute\" as referenced in Article 26(3)(b)(i) already has been submitted to arbitration in the *Blusun* case. In particular, it asserts (as developed further under Italy's fourth Rule 41(5) objection) that this case and the *Blusun* case concern the same measures by Italy taken in the same time span, are both based on Articles 10 and 13 of Part III of the ECT, and are both premised on the allegedly unexpected and unreasonable change of policy by the Italian Government which allegedly impacted the investors' right to benefit from FITs.201\n\nObjection, \u00b6 84.\n\n123.\n\nIn Italy's view,\n\nIf Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID may refuse to consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration where the investor has previously submitted such dispute to another (national or international) dispute resolution forum, this should apply *a fortiori* when the investor has submitted the dispute to another international arbitration under the same dispute resolution forum (ICSID).202\n\nIbid., \u00b6 85.\n\n124.\n\nIn other words, Italy contends that Article 26(3)(b)(i) should be read as excluding consent to arbitration whenever the investor already has chosen a channel to present its dispute, either domestic or international, including prior resort to ICSID.203 According to Italy, its interpretation is consistent with the canons of interpretation established by international law, as Article 26 of the ECT \"needs to be read in the context of the treaty itself and in the light of its object and purpose.\"204 Italy argues that its reading of Article 26 of the ECT is further confirmed by Article 26 of the ICSID Convention,205 which provides that \"consent of the parties\" to ICSID arbitration \"shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\"206\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 86 and 92.\n\nReply, \u00b6 48.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 87.\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 26.\n\n125.\n\nItaly further argues that Blusun and Eskosol must be considered the same investor for the purposes of Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, even though they are two different legal entities. In its view,\n\nthe *rationale* of the provision must be interpreted as meaning that two parallel proceedings cannot be started if their material consequence would be that the same dispute is taken twice under judgment for the same prejudice.207\n\nObjection, \u00b6 90.\n\n126.\n\nItaly relies on the following passage of the *Libananco* award, which in its view demonstrates a rejection of the type of \"strict\" approach to Article 26(3)(b)(i) urged by Eskosol:\n\nThere remains, however, a question as to how far the references in the text of Article 26(3)(b)(ii) to \"the Investor\" and \"the dispute\" themselves require some form of identity between the claims in, say, domestic legal proceedings and in a potential arbitration. The issue is not (as indicated) one which the Tribunal has to decide. The Tribunal is in some doubt, however, as to whether the provisions of a multilateral Treaty of this kind should be construed with the same strict rigour that might be appropriate for the application of a national procedural rule, e.g. of *res judicata*. The justification for a more flexible interpretative approach, informed by the purpose the treaty rule is intended to serve, would be not simply the different nature of the legal instruments involved, but also the difference in the prospective effects: the application of a domestic rule of *res judicata* is there to prevent the re-litigation of an issue that has already been authoritatively determined; a treaty rule may serve the different purpose of preventing forum shopping. An approach as strict as the one the Claimant contends for here would make the operation of Article 26(3)(b) entirely dependent (so far as its relationship with domestic legal proceedings was concerned) on whether the national law in question permitted the litigation of a treaty dispute as such in the local courts or tribunals. But to make the issue turn in that way on the form in which the local legal action had been brought, rather than on the real substance of the underlying rights at issue would clearly run the risk of subverting what may have been the intention behind the treaty provision.208\n\nIbid., \u00b6 92 (citing *Libananco Holdings Co Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, Exhibit RL-018, \u00b6 548 (***Libananco v. Turkey***)).\n\n127.\n\nItaly argues, further, that \"[i]f forum shopping is prohibited in situations where the investor could in fact legitimately benefit of alternative channels of protection of its interests (based on different and equally applicable legal basis) this should *a fortiori* apply in a situation where the same substantial investor utilizes a very formal reading of a treaty to open two parallel proceedings in front of two different tribunals to request satisfaction for the same claimed prejudice.\"209\n\nObjection, \u00b6 93.\n\n128.\n\nFinally, Italy contends that this objection is suitable for resolution under Rule 41(5). It contends that the *Blusun* award - and in particular the excerpts thereof which have been provided to the Tribunal - \"contains all necessary information on the case for the present stage of the procedure\"210 and accordingly that \"the Tribunal disposes of all relevant elements to judge on this objection.\"211 In its view, \"it clearly appears [from the *Blusun* award] that the two proceedings fully coincide to all extents.\"212 Further, this objection \"relate[s] to a legal defect and does not require any in-depth inquiry into the facts of the case,\"213 and therefore can be resolved at the Rule 41(5) stage.\n\nReply, \u00b6 51.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 15.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 15.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 16.\n\n***2. Eskosol's position***\n---------------------------\n\n129.\n\nEskosol contends that \"Italy is forced to argue for an expansive application of Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT,\" because \"[o]n its face, [this provision] does not apply where the two proceedings at issue are both before ICSID pursuant to a clause in an investment treaty.\"214 Eskosol argues that neither of the two categories mentioned in Article 26(2)(a) and (b), and then cross-referenced in Article 26(3)(b)(i), includes arbitration under the ECT.215 It notes that the option to submit the dispute to international arbitration is addressed separately in Article 26(4) of the ECT, and therefore is \"specifically carved out of the ECT's fork-in-the-road provision.\"216\n\nResponse, \u00b6 64.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 96.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 96.\n\n130.\n\nEskosol argues that Italy's argument fails in any event for two reasons. First, the *Blusun* case \"cannot be presumed to be the same dispute\" as this one, because at this juncture neither the Tribunal nor Eskosol has access to the full record of those proceedings,217 but simply to excerpts of the *Blusun* award selected by Italy for submission.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 65.\n\n131.\n\nSecond, Eskosol contends that it has not previously submitted its dispute to another tribunal, and that it cannot be deemed to be the same investor as Blusun. Eskosol argues that Italy itself concedes that Blusun and Eskosol are two distinct legal entities, and that Blusun is not the sole shareholder of Eskosol.218 It further relies on investment law jurisprudence which, in its view, \"recognizes the distinction between related legal entities.\" Specifically, Eskosol invokes the award in *CME v. Czech Republic*, the award on jurisdiction in *Champion Trading v. Egypt*, and the award in *Genin v. Estonia*.219\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 65-67; Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 69-72 (quoting *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 14 March 2003, Exhibit CL-035, \u00b6 432 (***CME v.

The Respondents have not shown any convincing reason why the Treaty should not be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning expressed therein which excludes from ICSID arbitration only those disputes where the ICSID claimant is also the claimant in the national proceedings.

In its view, in order to reach a conclusion as to whether the present dispute and the present investor are the same as those in the *Blusun* case, the Tribunal would need to analyze complex factual and legal issues, as well as significant documentary evidence presented in the *Blusun* case but not available at this juncture in this proceeding.220\n\nResponse, \u00b6 75.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nItaly's third objection would require the Tribunal to find, under the Rule 41(5) standard, that at least three conclusions are each \"manifest.\" *First*, the Tribunal would have to find it manifest as a matter of law that the ECT's \"fork in the road\" clause can be used to bar repeated ECT claims by the same \"Investor\" regarding the same \"dispute,\" and not merely resort to the ECT after resort to local proceedings or \"previously agreed\" procedures other than ECT arbitration. *Second*, the Tribunal would have to find it manifest as a matter of fact - in other words, not capable of reasonable dispute - that Eskosol and Blusun constitute the same \"Investor\" for purposes of Article 26(3)(b)(i). *Finally*, the Tribunal also would have to find it \"manifest\" that the \"dispute\" here submitted is substantively the same one that Blusun submitted in the prior ECT case.\n\n134.\n\nAs to the first proposition, the Tribunal accepts that it could be abusive for a given investor to submit a given dispute over and over again under the ECT, essentially declining to recognize the preclusive effect of one ECT award. It is skeptical, however, that a fork-in-the-road clause is the appropriate doctrine to bar such abusive re-litigation; the appropriate doctrine would appear to be *res judicata*, addressed further below. That conclusion is supported by the very notion of a \"fork\" in a road, which implies the choice between two different paths, rather than repeat travels down the identical path. In the case of the ECT, it is also supported by the structure of Article 26(2), which distinguishes between ECT arbitration - addressed in subsection (c), which cross-references \"the following paragraphs of this Article\" - and alternative mechanisms for dispute resolution, addressed in subsections (a) and (b).\n\n135.\n\nBut even if Article 26(3)(b)(i) somehow could be read as providing a procedural mechanism to address re-litigation of a dispute already litigated under the ECT by the same \"Investor,\" the Tribunal is unable to find that this is the situation here, because Blusun and Eskosol cannot be deemed (much less \"manifestly\") to be the same \"Investor,\" as both Article 26(3)(b)(i) and Annex 1D on their face require.221 The Tribunal incorporates by reference its detailed discussion of this issue below, in the context of Italy's fourth objection. The third objection is hereby denied.\n\nItaly itself acknowledges this requirement, by arguing that Article 26(3)(a) \"should be read to mean that a Contracting Party listed in Annex 1D does not give its unconditional consent anytime *the specific investor* requesting an arbitration has already undertaken another channel\") (emphasis added) (Objection, \u00b6 86).\n\n**D.** ***Lis Pendens*****,** ***Res Judicata*** **and Collateral Estoppel**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. Italy's position***\n-------------------------\n\n136.\n\nItaly's final Rule 41(5) objection is that public international law principles prohibit the prosecution of multiple claims in relation to the same prejudice, and preclude the opening of a new proceeding on a dispute that previously was submitted to another international arbitration tribunal (*lis pendens*)222 or actually was decided by such a tribunal (*res judicata* or collateral estoppel).223 According to Italy, these doctrines recognize that multiplicity of claims with respect to the same prejudice may lead to a number of shortcomings, including the risk of conflicting decisions and double recovery.224 In its view, *lis pendens* has a close relationship with the *res judicata* effect of a judgment, and these principles \"are usually treated under the same patterns.\"225 In its Objections, Italy focused on *lis pendens* because the *Blusun* case still was pending, but in its Reply, Italy asserts that \"once a final award is adopted, the relevant matters are rather covered by the principle of *res judicata.*\" Following the *Blusun* tribunal's issuance of its final award on 27 December 2016, Italy \"base[s] its arguments... on such articulation of the general preclusion principles established by international law.\"226\n\nObjection, \u00b6 13.\n\nReply, \u00b6 53.\n\nObjection, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97. Italy highlights the risk of double recovery by referring to the *Lauder* and *CME* cases; see *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 September 2001, Exhibit CL-036 (***Lauder v. Czech Republic***); and *CME Czech Republic BV v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award of 14 March 2003, Exhibit CL-035 (***CME v. Czech Republic***).\n\nObjection, \u00b6 97.\n\nReply, \u00b6 53.\n\n137.\n\nItaly further contends that \"there should be no dispute that [ *res judicata* ] is a rule of international law\" and that it applies to this proceedings.227 Its objection is therefore suitable for resolution at the Rule 41(5) stage, it contends, because the *Blusun* award sets forth its ruling on the legal challenges at issue, and the Tribunal can make a decision on the effect of such rulings under general principles of international law.228 Specifically, the *Blusun* award recognized that the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account \"were legitimate under both articles 10 and 13 of the ECT, and that the reasons why the investment was not realized and Eskosol became insolvent are independent from any behavior by Italy.\"229 Italy asserts that \"going further in this procedure to re-discuss issues of jurisdiction and competence\" already addressed in the *Blusun* case would impose additional efforts and costs on the parties \"for a claim that is genuinely without legal merit.\"230 In its view, the history of Rule 41(5) and its understanding in the context of ICSID procedures \"go strongly against such disruptive result.\"231\n\nIbid., \u00b6 54 (quoting *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican states (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings - Decision of the Tribunal, 26 June 2002, Exhibit RL-24, \u00b6 39: \"There is no doubt that *res judicata* is a principle of international law and even a general principle of law within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the statute of the International Court of Justice.\"\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 24.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 25.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 25.\n\n*a. The triple-identity test*\n-----------------------------\n\n138.\n\nItaly acknowledges that tribunals generally use the so-called \"triple-identity test\" to assess whether multiple proceedings have been opened on the same dispute.232 It asserts that the sole issue at stake here is how the triple-identity test should be applied.233 Italy suggests that the Tribunal follow a \"flexible\" rather than a \"strict\" approach to the test, such as that followed by the *Libananco* tribunal, which in Italy's view adopted a \"flexible approach... informed by the purpose that the standard is intended to serve in light of the relevant treaty.\"234\n\nObjection, \u00b6 103.\n\nReply, \u00b6 55.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 104; see also Reply, \u00b6 77.\n\n139.\n\nItaly contends that, \"in investment law *litispendence* may well relate to situations where a strict application of the triple identity test would deprive the rule of *effet utile*,\" and therefore its application should depart from the traditional application under domestic law.235 Italy argues that \"arbitral tribunals are... ready to recognize the specificity of arbitral proceedings, in particular in investment law, and to adopt a substantive approach.\"236\n\nObjection, \u00b6 104.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 105.\n\n*b. The identity of parties*\n----------------------------\n\n140.\n\nItaly asserts that international law principles do not limit preclusion to circumstances of strict identity between parties, but \"also recognize preclusion when a party is privy in the interests of another, to confirm that identity of parties is indeed a substantial rather than a formal standard.\"237 Italy relies on the decision rendered in *Amco v. Indonesia*, where the tribunal held as follows:\n\nThe foreign investor was Amco Asia [the parent company]; PT Amco [the subsidiary through with the investment was made] was but an instrumentality through which Amco Asia was to realize the investment. Now, the goal of the arbitration clause was to protect the investor. How could such protection be ensured, if Amco Asia would be refused the benefit of the clause? Moreover, the Tribunal did find PT Amco had this benefit, because of the foreign control under which it is placed: would it not be fully illogical to grant this protection to the controlled entity, but not to the controlling one?238\n\nIbid., \u00b6 107.\n\nReply, \u00b6 74; *Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Ltd. and P.t. Amco Indonesia v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID case No ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, 1 ICSID Reports, Exhibit RL-011, p. 400 (***Amco v. Indonesia***).\n\n141.\n\nItaly also cites the following passage from *Kl\u00f4ckner v. Cameroon,* where it notes the tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over the majority shareholder even though it was not a party to the agreement containing consent:\n\nThis Agreement, although formally signed by the Government and SOCAME [the subsidiary], was in fact negotiated between the Government and Kl\u00f4ckner [\u2026] Moreover, it is undeniable that it was manifestly concluded in the interest of Kl\u00f4ckner, at a time when Kl\u00f4ckner was SOCAME's majority shareholder. The Establishment Agreement reflected the contractual relationship between a foreign investor, acting through a local company, and the host country of this foreign investment.239\n\nReply, \u00b6 76; *Kl\u00f4ckner v. Cameroon*, ICSID Case No ARB/81/2, Award, 21 October 1983, 2 ICSID Reports, Exhibit RL-012, p. 17 ( ***Kl\u00f4ckner v. Cameroon*** *).* Italy also relies on *Martin v. Spain,* a case before the European Commission on Human Rights, in which the Commission held as follows:\n\nWhile it is true that formally the 23 individual applicants before the Commission are not the complainants who appealed before the ILO organs, access to those bodies being reserved for trade union organisations it is no less true that in the present case, unlike the case mentioned above the complaint was, in substance, submitted by the same complainants. On that basis the Commission concludes that in this case the parties were substantially the same. (Exhibit RL-026, p. 134).\n\n142.\n\nAccording to Italy, under the triple-identity test it is enough that either the parties themselves or their privies are the same. In support of this argument, Italy relies on *RSM v. Grenada*, where the tribunal recognized the concept of privity and upheld an objection under Rule 41(5) to an ICSID claim brought following a prior related proceeding.240\n\nReply, \u00b6 81, citing *RSM Production Corp. and others v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/6, Award, 1 September 2010, Exhibit RL-004, \u00b6\u00b6 7.1.4 to 7.1.7 (***RSM v. Grenada***).\n\n143.\n\nItaly contends that the claimants in the *Blusun* case and Eskosol in this case are so closely related that \"they have to be deemed identical.\"241 To the extent there is a dispute between the shareholders of Eskosol which resulted in the *Blusun* claimants initiating suit without consulting with the minority shareholders, that is \"purely a domestic issue\" which should not be transformed \"into a disruption of the ICSID mechanisms, which generates an inherent conflict of jurisdiction between ICSID tribunals on exactly the same dispute.\"242 The consequences of any dispute among shareholders should not be shifted to Italy, in its view, which in such circumstances could be \"confronted with a concrete risk of double recovery.\"243 Even though Italy's victory in the *Blusun* case now precludes a possibility of double recovery, Italy still is confronted with the additional burdens and costs of having to re-litigate the underlying issues.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 105.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 110\n\nIbid., \u00b6 112.\n\n144.\n\nFinally, Italy asserts also that Eskosol could have timely applied for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in the *Blusun* case \"to have its alleged rights protected in the appropriate forum.\"244 It notes that, instead, Eskosol decided first to initiate this separate and parallel arbitration in December 2015, and only later (on 21 June 2016) to apply to intervene as a non-disputing party. By that time, according to Italy, the written proceedings and most of the evidentiary hearing in the *Blusun* case had been completed, and closing arguments would have been completed also but for an unexpected postponement due to the hospitalization of a tribunal member.245 It was thus entirely foreseeable, and Eskosol's responsibility, that its application to intervene was rejected as untimely by the *Blusun* tribunal.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 109.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 109.\n\n*c. The identity of object and cause of action*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn Italy's view, this case and the *Blusun* case \"refer to the same dispute under all material tests.\"246\n\nIbid., \u00b6 105.\n\n146.\n\nFor purposes of a \"triple identity\" analysis, Italy defines the \"object\" as \"the type of relief sought,\" and the \"ground\" or \"cause of action\" to mean \"that the same legal arguments are relied upon.\"247 It notes that \"[m]any scholarly opinions and authorities refer to the risk that too restrictive criteria of identity of 'object' and 'ground' could lead to artificial 'claim splitting' to avoid the application of the *res judicata* effect of a prior award by seeking a different sort of relief or by raising new grounds in support of the same claim for relief.\"248\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 57, citing G. Zarra, *Parallel Proceedings in Investment Arbitration*, Giappichelli 2016, Exhibit RL-023, pp. 139-147 (in particular the *Machado* case at p. 143). Italy also refers to *Glaziou v. France*, UN Human Rights Commission 452/1991, Decision of 18 July 1994, CCPR/C/51/D/452/1991, Exhibit RL-025, point 7.2.\n\n147.\n\nItaly contends that, in the instant case, the facts and cause of action are the same as those in the *Blusun* case. From its perspective, this can be ascertained on the face of the excerpts provided from the *Blusun* award, where the *Blusun* tribunal decided on both the legitimacy of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account (at issue in this case too) and the lack of causation between these measures and the harm allegedly suffered by Blusun as a shareholder in Eskosol.249 Italy stresses that the *Blusun* award (which it quotes extensively at paragraphs 62 to 72 of the Reply) bases its reasoning on a general discussion of the project and the way in which it was implemented, and not on the specificities or qualities of the particular investors who were claimants therein. Therefore, according to Italy, the result would have been the same if the claim before the *Blusun* tribunal had been brought by Eskosol.250\n\nObjection, \u00b6 105; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 58-72.\n\nReply, \u00b6 71.\n\n*d. Collateral estoppel*\n------------------------\n\n148.\n\nItaly contends that the same factors would justify dismissal under the theory of collateral estoppel as an alternative to *res judicata*, because the issues to be decided in this case are the same as those already addressed in the *Blusun* case.251 Italy notes that collateral estoppel was applied by the tribunal in *RSM v. Grenada*, where the tribunal held as follows:\n\n[A] finding concerning a right, question or fact may not be re-litigated (and, thus, is binding on a subsequent tribunal), if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was distinctly put in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before that court or tribunal.\n\nIt is also not disputed that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is now well established as a general principle of law applicable in the international courts and tribunals such as this one.252\n\nIbid., \u00b6 84.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 85 (quoting *RSM v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-004, \u00b6\u00b6 7.1.1 and 7.1.2).\n\n149.\n\nItaly contends that the *Blusun* award \"finally establishes that the contested measures were fully legitimate and that the insolvency of Eskosol as well as the failure of the project were not caused by Italy's behavior.\"253\n\nReply, \u00b6 84.\n\n***2. Eskosol's position***\n---------------------------\n\n150.\n\nEskosol asserts that Italy \"fails to support its novel argument for why its international law objections would succeed were its treaty objections to fail.\"254\n\nResponse, \u00b6 76.\n\n*a. The triple-identity test*\n-----------------------------\n\n151.\n\nEskosol argues that \"the overwhelming majority of international law authorities agree that the principle of *res judicata* must be applied strictly.\"255 It rejects Italy's view that a strict application of the triple identity test could permit an \"artificial 'claim splitting'\" or give rise to a risk of double recovery. First, it contends that \"Eskosol and Blusun did not act in concert to split claims between the two proceedings. Rather, Blusun has apparently attempted to usurp Eskosol's claims and seek compensation for its direct losses,\"256 which Eskosol argues was improper. Second, Eskosol notes that there is no risk of double recovery in this case because Blusun's claims have been dismissed.257\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 101 (citing International Law Association, *Interim Report: \"Res Judicata\" and Arbitration* (2004), Exhibit CL-061, 14 and 26; and J.

The identity of parties*\n----------------------------\n\n152.\n\nEskosol argues that the triple-identity test is not satisfied because Blusun and Eskosol are not the same parties.258\n\nResponse, \u00b6 79.\n\n153.\n\nEskosol contends that legal authorities \"overwhelmingly support the application of a strict interpretation of identity of parties, not a relaxed standard, and that the identity test does not extend to privies.\"259 In support of its position, Eskosol relies on the decisions rendered in the cases *LESI-Dipenta v. Algeria* and *LESI and Astaldi v. Algeria*,260 and on *CME v. Czech Republic*, where the tribunal held that a company and its shareholders must be considered distinct entities for purposes of investment treaty arbitration.261 Eskosol also relies on the views of Dr. Hanno Wehland to the effect that:\n\nIf the assertion of a claim by a shareholder would prevent a company from exercising the claims it may have itself, this would indirectly affect the interests of other shareholders. Such an approach could thus hardly be reconciled with the principle '*res inter alios judicata aliis neque nocet neque* *prodest*.'262\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 106.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 108-109 (citing *Consorzio Groupement L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA v.

Turkey*, Eskosol argues that the tribunal \"did not apply or endorse a flexible approach to *res judicata*.\"266 Rather, it explains, the tribunal's *obiter dicta* concerned application of Article 26(3) of the ECT, and more specifically to what extent the terms \"Investor\" and \"dispute\" require identity between claims. Eskosol mentions that \"while the tribunal. favored a somewhat flexible approach in interpreting the ECT, it accepted that, where applicable, such as in the case of a fork-in-the-road clause or the *res judicata* principle, legal personality should not be ignored.\"267\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 114-118.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 114-115 (citing *Amco v.

Eskosol argues that it cannot be deemed to be substantially the same as the *Blusun* claimants, nor did those claimants effectively present and protect Eskosol's interests in the prior arbitration.270 To the contrary, Eskosol avers that: (1) the *Blusun* claimants failed to consult with Eskosol in the decision to bring the first arbitration; (2) they failed to communicate with Eskosol during the course of the proceedings; (3) they refused even to consider a consolidation of the two claims; (4) they did not represent the significant interests of Eskosol, which includes the interests of its minority shareholders and creditors and not just the interests of Blusun; and (5) they had no intention of sharing any proceeds with Eskosol to make it whole.271\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 119.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 120.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 122.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 122.\n\n157.\n\nEskosol also asserts that *RSM v.

It explains that in that case, RSM first sued on its own behalf and then brought a second claim together with all of its shareholders; the tribunal held that the shareholders were bound by the results of the first case, as they owned 100% of RSM and had approved RSM's decision to bring both arbitrations.272\n\nIbid., \u00b6 123 (citing *RSM v.

It explains that the application was intended to ensure that the *Blusun* tribunal \"was appraised of Eskosol's own proceedings against Italy\" and that \"Blusun was not seeking to recover damages that only Eskosol was entitled to recover.\"273 At the hearing, Eskosol further explained that before filing its Rule 37(2) application in the *Blusun* case, it first tried to achieve a consolidation of this case with that one so its interests could be directly represented as a party rather than a non-party, but once consolidation was refused, it filed the Rule 37(2) application in *Blusun* to ensure that the *Blusun* tribunal was aware of the disparate interests between Blusun and Eskosol as well as Eskosol's initiation of a separate arbitration in its own name.274\n\nResponse, \u00b6 81.\n\nHearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, at 107:12-108:2.\n\n*c. The identity of object and cause of action*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nEskosol contends that Italy has failed \"to show that there is identity of object and/or cause of action\" between this case and the *Blusun* case, or to provide enough information for the Tribunal to make such a determination without engaging in a difficult analysis of the law and facts at issue.\"275\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 124.\n\n160.\n\nIn Eskosol's view, it should not have to rely on Italy's characterization of the *Blusun* award. It notes that: (1) it has no access to the record of the *Blusun* case; (2) it cannot know whether the excerpts of the *Blusun* award submitted by Italy actually illustrate in detail the pleadings and all the legal reasoning and factual submissions; (3) the excerpts provided by Italy do not contain the operative section of the award, \"which is essential because *res judicata* effect attaches only to the *dispositif* of an award\";276 and (4) even if the Tribunal had access to the *dispositif*, without the factual section and the parties' positions \"it is impossible to know whether the reasons contained in the excerpted parts of the award actually formed the foundations for the operative part of the *Blusun* award.\"277\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 126.\n\n161.\n\nEskosol rejects Italy's definition of \"object\" as \"the same *type*\" of relief sought. It contends that for the object to be identical, for purposes of a *res judicata* analysis, it has to be \"the same claim or relief.\"278 Comparing the relief sought in the *Blusun* case (as it can be deduced from the excerpts of the *Blusun* award submitted by Italy) and the relief sought in the Request, Eskosol contends that the \"relief sought is plainly not identical.\"279 In its view, the excerpts suggests that Blusun sought recovery for lost \"capital gains\" benefits it could have secured by selling its shareholding in Eskosol, while Eskosol's claims arise directly out of the losses that it suffered as the operating company.280 Eskosol also emphasizes that it is bringing an umbrella clause claim under the ECT, which Blusun apparently did not assert.281\n\nIbid., \u00b6 128 (emphasis added by Eskosol). In support of this proposition, the Claimant refers to International Law Association, Final Report on Res Judicata and Arbitration, Arbitration International, Vol. 25, No. 1 (2006), Exhibit CL-080, \u00b6 42; H. Wehland, *The Coordination of Multiple Proceedings in Investment Treaty Arbitration* (OUP 2013), Exhibit CL-040, pp. 201-202, \u00b6\u00b6 6,117-6.118; and *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award, 7 June 2008, Exhibit CL-078, \u00b6 130.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 131.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 131.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 132-133 (referencing paragraph 311 of the *Blusun* Award excerpted by Italy).\n\n162.\n\nEskosol also rejects Italy's definition of \"cause of action\" as meaning, for purposes of the triple-identity test, \"that the same legal arguments are relied upon.\" In its view, the term \"cause of action\" \"may be construed broadly as all facts and circumstances arising from a single event and relying on the same evidence which are necessary to give rise to a right to relief.\"282 On this basis, it contends that \"cause of action can only be ascertained with reference to a tribunal's reasoning and factual findings.\"283 Yet even on the basis of the excerpts produced by Italy, Eskosol disagrees with some of the factual findings apparently made by the *Blusun* tribunal, which in its view likely were attributable to the evidence in the record in the *Blusun* case. It argues Eskosol would likely present different evidence and arguments in this case. On this basis, Eskosol contends that Italy has failed to show identity of cause of action for purposes of a triple identity analysis.284\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 135 (quoting International Law Association, Final Report on Res Judicata and Arbitration, Arbitration International, Vol. 25, No. 1 (2006), Exhibit CL-080, \u00b6 43, footnote 18).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 135 (quoting the dissenting opinion of Judge Anzilotti in the *Chorzow Factory* case, Exhibit CL-077, p. 24); see also *CME v. Czech Republic*, Exhibit CL-035, \u00b6 432.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 137.\n\n*d. Collateral estoppel*\n------------------------\n\n163.\n\nFinally, Eskosol argues that \"judicial acceptance of the concept [of collateral estoppel] is not universal,\"285 and that even if it does apply in international arbitration, the doctrine of collateral estoppel has no application in this case.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 140.\n\n164.\n\nFollowing the criteria in *RSM v. Grenada*, Eskosol argues that \"to collaterally estop a claimant from disputing questions of law or fact raised and decided in a previous arbitration, a respondent must show: (1) that the question of law or fact was distinctly put at issue in the arbitration; (2) that a competent tribunal decided the question of law or fact; (3) that the question of law or fact was necessary to resolving a claim before the tribunal; (4) that the same parties (or their privies) were party to the previous arbitration; and (5) that application of collateral estoppel would not lead to an inequitable result.\"286\n\nIbid., \u00b6 143.\n\n165.\n\nIn Eskosol's view, one can only speculate as to the first three elements because Italy has not provided a full copy of the *Blusun* award.287 As to the fourth and fifth elements, Eskosol argues that they \"are plainly not met,\"288 because Blusun and Eskosol are distinct parties with separate interests, Eskosol did not participate in the prior arbitration, and it would be inequitable to bind Eskosol to the result of that arbitration in these circumstances.289\n\nIbid., \u00b6 144.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 145.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 145.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe ECT authorizes a variety of entities to proceed as qualified \"Investor[s]\" under its terms. This includes *foreign* investors like Blusun, bringing suit relating to investments that they \"own[] or control[] directly or indirectly,\" including \"a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise.\"290 But it also includes *local companies* like Eskosol, which are expressly permitted to bring claims in their own name provided that they meet the foreign control requirements of Article 26(7). Italy itself admits that in principle, both Blusun and Eskosol could be legitimate investors under the ECT.291 A shareholder's claim for its reflective loss through an entity in which it holds shares cannot be equated automatically to that entity's claim for its direct losses.\n\nArticles 26(1) and 1(6)(b) of the ECT, Exhibit C-1.\n\nReply, \u00b6 45 (stating that it does not contend that \"since Blusun was a legitimate investor under the ECT and ICSID, then Eskosol could not also be one\").\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that notwithstanding this fact, there may be certain circumstances in which a foreign shareholder and the local company in which it holds shares have such identical interests that it would be abusive to permit arbitration of a given dispute by one after the other already has concluded an arbitration over the same dispute. This might well be the case, for example, where the local company is wholly owned by the foreign shareholder. In *RSM v. Grenada*, the corporate claimant RSM sued first, and then after losing the case it sued a second time, on this occasion joined by the three shareholders who collectively owned 100% of RSM. The tribunal found - on a Rule 41(5) application - that because the three shareholders had entire control over RSM, they effectively had acted in concert with it and had their interests represented in the first proceeding, and therefore could not proceed with the second one.292 In the Tribunal's view, the same conclusion would be equally logical in the reverse situation, if a first case were brought by the 100% shareholders of a local company and thereafter a second case was attempted by the local company that they wholly owned.\n\n*RSM v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-004, \u00b6\u00b6 7.1.5-7.1.6\n\n168.\n\nHowever, this is not such a case. It is undisputed that Blusun owns only 80% of Eskosol. It is also apparent from the case caption in the *Blusun* case that the *Blusun* claimants did not join Eskosol itself as a formal party to the proceedings, as controlling shareholders often have the power to do by following the corporate formalities necessary to obtain approval to sue on a company's behalf. To the contrary, both in the *Blusun* case and in this one, Eskosol has argued that the *Blusun* claimants had no authority to represent Eskosol's interests, proceeded without taking the required legal steps to act on Eskosol's behalf, and had no intention (if victorious) of channeling compensation through Eskosol so that its minority shareholders, as well as its creditors in bankruptcy, could share in the proceeds.293 For its part, Italy claims reluctance to share the *Blusun* award with Eskosol, on the grounds that so doing might be considered a breach of its confidentiality obligations to the *Blusun* claimants. At the very least, this suggests Italy has some doubts that Eskosol and Blusun must properly be considered the same party.\n\n*Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Application Under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) of June 21, 2016, Exhibit R-003, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 17, 36; see also Rejoinder, \u00b6 122.\n\n169.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal would have difficulty concluding - and certainly cannot find it \"manifest\" - that Blusun and Eskosol effectively were the same party, so as to preclude the later from attempting any claim after the former already has done so.\n\n170.\n\nObviously, there could be both efficiency and fairness reasons to prefer that all shareholders of an entity affected by a challenged State measure could be heard in a single forum at a single time, together with the entity that they collectively own. The Tribunal is not unsympathetic to Italy's circumstances, having to face claims now that are closely related to those it already successfully vanquished in a prior proceeding.294 But the fact remains that neither the ICSID system as presently designed, nor the ECT itself, incorporate clear avenues (much less a requirement) for joinder in a single proceeding of all stakeholders potentially affected by the outcome. Absent such a system - which States have the power to create if they so wish - it would not be appropriate for tribunals to preclude arbitration by qualified investors, simply because *other* qualified investors may have proceeded before them without their participation. The possibility that domestic legal systems may afford potential remedies - for example, claims by minority shareholders or bankruptcy receivers against majority shareholders who take unauthorized actions in contravention of domestic law295 - is not sufficient basis for precluding qualified investors from exercising their fundamental right to access the ICSID system.\n\nHad Italy instead not prevailed in the prior proceeding, but been ordered to pay compensation to the *Blusun* claimants, the Tribunal of course would have to be vigilant to prevent double recovery from Italy for the same loss. Because of the outcome of the *Blusun* case, however, that situation does not arise here.\n\nObjection, \u00b6 110.\n\n171.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Rule 41(5) objection premised on the identity of parties between the *Blusun* case and this one, whether presented under the *res judicata* doctrine or the similar doctrine of collateral estoppel. Because it is far from manifest that the parties were identical, the Tribunal need not proceed to the further steps in a preclusion analysis, involving identity of object and identity of cause.\n\n172.\n\nOf course, Italy is free later in this case to argue, if it so wishes, that the conclusions of the *Blusun* tribunal were persuasive and should be followed by this Tribunal, exercising its independent judgment. However, Italy may not make such arguments based on selective excerpts from the *Blusun* award. To the extent it wishes to rely on that award for any purpose in this case, it is ordered to produce the award in full. The Tribunal notes Italy's acknowledgment during the Hearing that such an order would allow it to produce the *Blusun* award, notwithstanding the obligations of confidentiality applicable in that case.296\n\nHearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, 134:5-6.\n\n**VI. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\n173.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Denies Italy's application for dismissal of Eskosol's claims on the grounds that they are \"manifestly without legal merit,\" pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules;\n\n(2) Orders Italy, to the extent and at such time as it wishes to rely on the *Blusun* award for any purpose in this case, to produce such award in full;\n\n(3) Defers ruling on allocation of the costs of the Rule 41(5) application, to be considered together with the allocation of further costs of this arbitration at a subsequent stage of proceedings."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2017-04-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nAs noted in the Tribunal's prior Decision on Respondent's Application under Rule 41(5), dated March 20, 2017, this case concerns a dispute submitted to ICSID under the Energy Charter Treaty and the ICSID Convention, involving claims by Eskosol S.p.A. *in liquidazione* (\"**Eskosol**\" or the \"**Claimant**\") against the Italian Republic (\"**Italy**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). The background information and procedural history of the dispute is not repeated herein, except as relevant to Italy's Request for Provisional Measures Under Rule 39(1), filed on January 18, 2017 (the \"**Request**\").\n\n2.\n\nWith respect to the Request, by letter of January 23, 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to suggest a briefing schedule by January 30, 2017. By letter of January 30, 2017, Eskosol requested that the Tribunal suspend any further briefing on the Request until Italy paid its share of the first advance deposit. Italy did not respond to the Tribunal's January 23, 2017 invitation to suggest a briefing schedule on the Request.\n\n3.\n\nOn February 8, 2017, the Tribunal held a hearing to address Italy's then-pending Rule 41(5) application. During that hearing, the Parties agreed that the current Request would be addressed in one round of submissions, with Eskosol's response due on March 3, 2017.1 As potentially relevant to the Request, Eskosol also confirmed that it is pursuing this claim with the use of external funding.2 By letter of February 10, 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it agreed to fix March 3, 2017, as the deadline for Eskosol's submission of its response to the Request.\n\nHearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, at 145:4-14.\n\nHearing Transcript, February 8, 2017, at 125:1-7; *see also* Response, \u00b6 8.\n\n4.\n\nOn February 13, 2017, ICSID confirmed that it had received Italy's payment of its share of the first advance deposit.\n\n5.\n\nOn March 3, 2017, Eskosol filed its \"Response to Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures\" (the \"**Response**\").\n\n**II. ITALY'S REQUEST FOR PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIn its Request, Italy asks the Tribunal to:\n\n(a) Direct Eskosol to post an irrevocable bank guarantee or analogous security in the amount of $250,000 [the \"**Security Application**\"];\n\n(b) Direct Eskosol to submit Exhibits C-005 and C-006 in their integrity to permit the Respondent and the Tribunal to get confirmation whether a funding third party did commit itself to cover Eskosol['s] costs of these proceedings [the \"**Disclosure Application**\"].\n\n(c) In the event third party funding is confirmed, and as an alternative to (a), direct Eskosol to procure from such third party \u2013 proved to have demonstrably adequate assets \u2013 a legally binding undertaking to pay any costs order entered against Eskosol.3\n\nRequest, Section V.\n\n7.\n\nEskosol, in turn, argues that Italy's Request should be rejected for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, the Tribunal lacks the authority to order security for costs. Second, and more importantly, even if such authority were deemed to exist, Italy's Request should fail because it does not satisfy the exacting requirements for such orders to be made \u2026. Third, Eskosol already has an after-the-event insurance policy (the \"**ATE Insurance**\") in respect of potential adverse costs for up to \u20ac1 million that is more than sufficient to address Italy's request \"*for analogous security in the amount of $250,000 as security for costs.*\" \u2026.4\n\nFinally, as Eskosol already disclosed that it has external funding here, Italy's request for document production has become moot and thus should be dismissed.5\n\nResponse, \u00b6 2 (quoting Request, Section V(a)).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 3.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties' respective arguments are summarized in turn below.\n\n**A. The Security Application**\n-------------------------------\n\n***1. Italy's position***\n-------------------------\n\n*a. The power to order security for costs*\n------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nItaly grounds its application on Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1). It contends that \"[i]t is undisputed that, in general, an ICSID tribunal has the authority to order provisional measures to preserve a party's right,\" but admits that \"some controversy has arisen whether orders to request security for costs could be granted.\"6 In its view, however, such power \"has now been fully admitted by a large number of ICSID tribunals.\"7\n\nRequest, \u00b6 22.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 23. Italy relies on the statement in *RSM Production Corporation v. Saint Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, August 13, 2014, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 48 (***RSM v. Saint Lucia***), that \"a large number of ICSID tribunals have ruled that a measure requesting the lodging of security for costs does, generally, not fall outside an ICSID tribunal's power provided exceptional circumstances exist\" (Request, \u00b6 23). Italy also cites *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Preliminary Issues, June 23, 2008, Exhibit RL-029, \u00b6 57 (***Libananco v. Turkey***); *Rachel S. Grynberg, Stephen M. Grynberg, Miriam Z. Grynberg and RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/06, Decision on Respondent's Application for Security of Costs, October 14, 2010, Exhibit RL-030, \u00b6 5.16 (***Grynberg v. Grenada**)* ; and *Victor Pey Casado, Fundaci\u00f3n Presidente Allende v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, September 25, 2001, Exhibit RL-031, \u00b6 88 (***Pey Casado v. Chile***).\n\n10.\n\nIn Italy's view, the granting of an order for provisional measures is subject to two conditions: \"(i) that a right in need of protection exists, and (ii) that the circumstances require that the provisional measures be ordered to preserve such right, *\u2018which necessitates a showing that the situation is urgent and the requested measure are* [sic] *necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the party's right to be protected'*.\"8 Italy contends that, here, the provisional measure is requested \"for the protection of its right to claim reimbursement of the costs it is incurring in the course of this phase of the arbitration.\"9\n\nRequest, \u00b6 24 (emphasis in the Request).\n\nRequest, \u00b6 25.\n\n11.\n\nItaly argues that both substantive and procedural rights are protected by Rule 39(1).10 It also contends that its request for reimbursement is part of its defense, and that it is directly linked to the relief requested, namely the dismissal of the claim for manifest lack of legal merit and the reimbursement of the expenses necessary for its defense.11\n\nRequest, \u00b6 26, quoting *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 66: \"Costs decisions, while contingent upon the tribunal's ultimate and final decision on the merits and the exercise of its discretion to grant cost reimbursement, are nonetheless part of the arbitral process the integrity of which deserves protection by Article 47 ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.\"\n\nRequest, \u00b6 27.\n\n12.\n\nItaly also relies on *RSM v. Saint Lucia* to reject the idea that, in order to be protected, a right must be actual at the time of the request:\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the right to be preserved by a provisional measure need not already exist at the time the request is made. Also future or conditional rights such as potential claim for cost reimbursement qualify as \"rights to be preserved\". The hypothetical element of the right at issue is one of the inherent characteristics of the regime of provisional measures.12\n\nRequest, \u00b6 29, quoting *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 72. Italy also relies on *Grynberg v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-030, \u00b6 5.8.\n\n*b. The granting of security for costs in the instant case*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nItaly argues that \"an order for security for costs must be required by the circumstances.\" In its view, in this case there is a \"material risk that a cost award will not be complied with,\" a risk that it deems more serious than the one considered by the tribunal in *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, where the tribunal granted the security for costs order.13\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33. Italy relies on the following passage from *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 82: \"[\u2026] contrary to the situation in previous ICSID cases where tribunals have denied the application for security for costs (*inter alia*) because there was no evidence concerning the financial situation of the opposing party, it has been established to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that Claimant does not have sufficient financial resources. Whereas it has previously been held that such financial limitations as such do not provide a sufficient basis for ordering security for costs, the circumstances of the present case are different. In particular Claimant's consistent procedural history in other ICSID and non-ICSID proceedings provide compelling grounds for granting Respondent's request.\"\n\n14.\n\nItaly contends that \"the very fact that Eskosol has been declared into bankruptcy \u2026 confirm[s] that it would not have sufficient financial resources to compensate the Respondent for its undue costs.\"14 It also contends that where a claimant is funded by a third party, \"the risk that the cost award would not be complied with would become more material and serious, and the need for security for costs even more urgent.\"15\n\nRequest, \u00b6 34.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. See also *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 83: \"Moreover, the admitted third party funding further supports the Tribunal's concern that Claimant will not comply with a cost award rendered against it, since, in the absence of security or guarantees being offered, it is doubtful whether the third party will assume responsibility for honoring such an award. Against this background, the Tribunal regards it as unjustified to burden Respondent with the risk emanating from the uncertainty as to whether or not the unknown third party will be willing to comply with a potential costs award in Respondent's favor.\"\n\n15.\n\nItaly invokes the declaration of Eskosol's insolvency by the Brindisi bankruptcy tribunal, and contends that the tribunal's findings establish that \"the value of [Eskosol's] assets is extremely low in respect of the outstanding exposure to creditors.\"16 Specifically, Italy quotes the Brindisi tribunal as follows:\n\nIn primis, with regard to the quantitative limit indicated in the last paragraph of Article 15 of the bankruptcy law on the procedure for the purposes of dealing with defaults, it should be noted that in the present case, the amount of debt by far exceeds \u20ac30,000.00.\n\n\u2026\n\nFinally, because the defendant company is in liquidation and of the obvious lack of assets to cope with the amount of debt, one cannot even abstractly refer to a future capacity to generate sufficient income to cover the debt situation.17\n\nRequest, \u00b6 9.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, citing Exhibit R-001, p. 2, \u00b6 6 and p. 3, \u00b6 3.\n\n16.\n\nItaly asserts that, in this context, its chances of recovering the costs incurred in this procedure would be put at serious risk, \"if not made factually impossible.\"18\n\nRequest, \u00b6 11.\n\n17.\n\nItaly also grounds its application on the suspicion (subsequently confirmed by Eskosol) that Eskosol is relying on financing by third parties, whom Italy contends would not be bound by an award on costs.19 Italy's suspicions regarding third-party funding were premised in part on the basis of the resolution of the Italian bankruptcy judge authorizing Eskosol's initiation of this arbitration, which (as submitted by Eskosol) contained \"material portions omitted\" that appeared to suggest the judge understood the arbitration would entail no costs and no commitment on the part of Eskosol.20\n\nRequest, \u00b6 12.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15. Italy cites, in particular, the following passages of the judge's resolution, emphasizing the portions omitted by Eskosol in its submission: \"having considered that it did not occur any obstacle for the requested authorization (besides, consisting in the mere formal activities to execute the mandate and [OMITTED]) \u2026 For these reasons, authorizes the receiver Dr. Contardi to subscribe [OMITTED] and to give mandate to the law firm indicated in the request.\" (Exhibit C-005)\n\n18.\n\nItaly argues that \"the need for a provisional measure as a matter of urgency is due in particular to the fact that once an award is rendered, the tribunal will have no power to order a funding third party to undertake a commitment to secure payment of costs to the Respondent.\"21 In particular, the urgency of the Request \u2013 at the time it was filed \u2013 was said to be connected to the pendency of Italy's Rule 41(5) application, because of a concern that \"in case its 41(5) objection is upheld,\" there would be no further opportunity in the case to seek protection of any costs award in its favor.22 The implication was that the specific amount of the security sought in the Request \u2013 $250,000 \u2013 was connected to the level of costs Italy had or would incur \"during this first phase of the proceedings,\" up through the Tribunal's decision on Italy's Rule 41(5) application. Italy did not specify what, if any, additional level of security it might wish in the event that application were denied and the case continued into further phases.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 18.

The power to order security for costs*\n------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nEskosol asserts that Article 47 and Rule 39(1) allow a tribunal to recommend provisional measures to preserve the respective rights of either party. It argues, however, that \"Italy has no right *per se* to be awarded its costs here.\"23 In its view, Italy's request presumes that it will prevail in this matter and that costs will be awarded to it. Italy's \"right\" to be awarded its cost \"is thus speculative at best, and not a concrete right that is the appropriate subject of an Article 47 and Rule 39 application.\"24\n\nResponse, \u00b6 12.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 12.\n\n20.\n\nEskosol contends that Article 47 and Rule 39(1) do not grant the Tribunal authority to impose a security for costs order on Eskosol. It also notes that while some decisions \"have departed from the wording of Article 47 and Rule 39 and accepted the power to order security; others have held the opposite conclusion.\"25\n\nResponse, \u00b6 14, citing *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Spain*, ICISD Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2, October 28, 1999, Exhibit RL-032, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15 (***Maffezini v.

Saint Lucia*, Eskosol contends that there is no reason for a tribunal to ignore the terms of Article 47 and Rule 39 to create a procedural entitlement that the ICSID framework does not envisage. In its view, doing so \"would allow respondent-States to stifle claims, thus betraying the overall purpose and objective of the ICSID Convention.\"26\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 17; *see also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, citing *RSM v. Saint Lucia* (dissent).\n\n22.\n\nEskosol agrees with Italy that the granting of an order for provisional measures requires a showing that the situation is urgent and that the requested measures are necessary to prevent irreparable harm.27 It contends, however, that according to ICSID case law a tribunal can order a measure \"only if the harm spared the petitioner exceeds greatly the damage caused to the party affected by it,\" and that these measures protect only \"imminent harm, not potential or hypothetical harm.\"28\n\nResponse, \u00b6 20.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 21, citing *Burimi S.R.L. and Eagle Games SH.A. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, May 3, 2012, Exhibit CL-088, \u00b6 35 (***Burimi v. Albania***).\n\n23.\n\nEskosol finally argues that, while Italy concedes that an order for security for costs requires the existence of extraordinary circumstances, such circumstances cannot be grounded simply on the basis of a claimant's lack of funds.29 Eskosol relies on a series of decisions to the effect that: \"(1) access to ICISD should not be conditional upon a claimant furnishing security for costs; and (2) a risk of non-payment of costs due to impecuniosity does not of itself satisfy the extraordinarily high burden to order security for costs.\"30 It distinguishes the situation in *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, where \"[t]he findings of the majority [of the tribunal] were influenced by an abusive pattern of conduct on the part of the claimant, RSM,\" and where RSM had refused twice to make required payments in ICSID proceedings.31\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 33; *see also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 34-39. Eskosol relies on the following passage from *Burimi v. Albania* : \"[e]ven if there were more persuasive evidence than that offered by the Respondent concerning the Claimants' ability or willingness to pay a possible award of costs, the Tribunal would be reluctant to impose on the Claimants what amounts to an additional financial requirement as a condition for the case to proceed.\" (Exhibit CL-088, \u00b6 41). Eskosol also relies on *EuroGas Inc. and Belmond Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Decision on the Parties' Requests for Provisional Measures, June 23, 2017, Exhibit CL-090, \u00b6\u00b6 111, 123 (***EuroGas v.

The granting of security for costs in the instant case*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nEskosol argues that, even if the Tribunal finds that it has the power to order security for costs, in the instant case \"it is neither urgent nor necessary to prevent irreparable harm to Italy's rights,\" and there are no extraordinary circumstances requiring the imposition of this exceptional measure.32\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 32.\n\n25.\n\nAccording to Eskosol, the harm caused by the lack of payment of an award is \"by its own nature... highly hypothetical,\" as it requires two conditions to be met: the moving party must prevail in the proceedings, and the tribunal must decide to shift costs, which is discretionary under the ICSID framework.33 By contrast, Eskosol asserts, \"the harm caused to a claimant is actual and could well prevent it from having access to justice,\" and therefore an order for security for costs can only be granted in \"truly exceptional cases.\"34\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 30.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 43.\n\n26.\n\nEskosol argues that Italy cannot show in this case that security for costs is necessary to prevent irreparable harm, because it already has obtained the ATE insurance, which makes the risk of non-payment of an award non-existent or extremely limited.35 Eskosol notes that the coverage in the ATE Insurance (\u20ac1 million) significantly exceeds the amount of security sought by Italy, while security in the terms sought by Italy (an irrevocable bank guarantee) would increase the financial burden that Eskosol will have to bear to pursue its case.36\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 30.\n\n27.\n\nMoreover, an order for security for costs would be inappropriate in this case because Italy's application rests on the fact that Eskosol is bankrupt. In Eskosol's view, its need to resort to third-party funding is the result of the bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy ultimately is the result of Italy's internationally wrongful actions, which form the basis of its complaints in these proceedings. As a result, \"it would be abhorrent for the Tribunal to permit Italy to benefit from its own misconduct by allowing Italy to impose even further financial burden upon Eskosol through a security for cost order.\"37\n\nResponse, \u00b6 26. Eskosol relies on the following passage of Dr. Griffith's opinion in *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, Assenting Opinion (Griffith), \u00b6 2: \"That the claimant does not have funds to meet costs orders if unsuccessful is no reason to make orders for security. Commonly, this situation is contended to arise from the matters of complaint, and it would be inconsistent with the BIT entitlements for such financial issues arising from its lacks of funds to derogate from the investor's treaty entitlements.\"\n\n28.\n\nEskosol further argues that, in the light of the ATE insurance, Italy's argument that security for costs is needed as a matter of urgency is meritless. It also notes that the question of urgency requires the Tribunal to consider the likelihood of harm if the measure is not issued before the final award, and reiterates that Italy's application is speculative in that it presumes that it will prevail on the merits and that it will obtain a costs award.38\n\nResponse, \u00b6 30, citing *Burumi v. Albania*, Exhibit CL-088, \u00b6 36: \"[T]he alleged harm is speculative, there is no basis for finding that the matter cannot await the outcome of an award.\"\n\n29.\n\nEskosol also contends that no extraordinary circumstances exist in this case that justify an order for security for costs.39 Eskosol's bankruptcy of itself does not amount to an extraordinary circumstance that should lead the Tribunal to order security for costs. Moreover, Eskosol has not engaged in any abusive behavior (and Italy does not argue otherwise); rather, \"an ATE insurance that protects Italy's hypothetical interest is in place and Eskosol has timely paid its share of the advance on costs.\"40\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 40, distinguishing this case from the situation in *RSM v. Saint Lucia* (see Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31).\n\n30.\n\nEskosol finally argues that a number of arbitral tribunals have confirmed that the presence of a third-party funder would not amount to an extraordinary circumstance requiring the imposition of security for costs.41 It notes that Italy has not provided any authority supporting its request that the third party funder provide a binding undertaking to pay any costs ordered against Eskosol, which should be rejected.42 In any event, says Eskosol, \"while the third party funder has not agreed to be responsible for any eventual cost award directly, it has already taken measures that address this question,\" as the ATE insurance has been paid by the third party funder.43 More generally, Eskosol argues that third party financing is in principle no different from any other funding mechanism, and a tribunal should not impose security for costs obligations on a funder unless it equally would have been willing to impose such obligations on a bank providing traditional loan financing to a party.44\n\nResponse, \u00b6 41, citing *EuroGas v. Slovak Republic*, Exhibit CL-090, \u00b6 123; and *Hamester v. Ghana*, Exhibit CL-091, \u00b6 14.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 45.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 47.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 48.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by addressing the issue of authority. As a threshold matter, nothing in the Convention or the Rules, addressing an ICSID tribunal's authority to recommend provisional measures, suggests that this authority is limited only to certain types of measures, or alternatively stated, excludes certain types of measures. Requests for measures regarding security for costs are therefore not *ipso facto* beyond the scope of a tribunal's powers.45\n\n*See Grynberg v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-030, \u00b6 5.5 (\"Neither Article 47, nor Rule 39 specify the type of provisional measure a Tribunal may recommend. This being the case, and subject to one caveat, a measure requiring the lodging of security for costs \u2026 would not, as a matter of jurisdiction, appear to fall outside a tribunal's power. That is, unless such a measure cannot be said to relate to the preservation of the applying party's rights \u2013 the preservation of which is the only limiting factor on the nature of a permissible provisional measure.\").\n\n32.\n\nAs with any provisional measure request, however, the starting point is identification of the particular \"rights\" that the applicant claims are appropriate to be preserved. Article 47 confines a tribunal's authority to a situation in which it finds that \"the circumstances \u2026 require\" a particular measure to be taken \"to preserve the respective rights of either party.\" Before one can examine what is \"required\" \u2013 an inquiry that is commonly understood to involve assessments of necessity, urgency and proportionality \u2013 it is important to examine the nature of the \"rights,\" or entitlement, said to be in question.\n\n33.\n\nIn *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, the \"right\" sought to be preserved by the applicant was said to be a \"*right to claim reimbursement* of the costs it incurs\" in the arbitration, in the event it prevailed on the merits and the tribunal granted a claim for recovery of costs.46 This was said to be \"qualified as a *procedural* right \u2026 and moreover as a *contingent* right which only arises if and when the two conditions \u2026 are met.\"47 To be analytically precise, however, what is really sought in such cases is not preservation of a right to \"*claim*\" reimbursement, or even to *obtain* a costs award as a consequence of such claim. Neither of these are obstructed in any way by the presence or absence of assets. Rather, what is really sought in these cases is an assurance that this pursuit will be *meaningful*, in the sense that there will be assets available at the end of the case against which to enforce any costs award. At issue is thus not truly a concern about a *procedural* right (to preserve a path to obtain a cost award), but instead an *outcome-related* worry about collection on such an award. This concern about collection is sometimes framed as part of a broader *right to effective relief*, considered to be part of the panoply of rights encompassed by the notion of procedural integrity.48\n\n*RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 63 (emphasis added); *see also id.*, \u00b6 68 (referring to \"Respondent's procedural *right to claim reimbursement* of its expenses,\" as \"directly linked to the relief it requests\" as part of its defense) (emphasis added).\n\n*RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 64 (emphasis in original).\n\n*See* *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6 66 (\"Costs decisions \u2026 are \u2026 part of the arbitral process the integrity of which deserves protection\") and \u00b6 69 (\"the integrity of the proceedings \u2026 comprises both substantive and procedural rights, such as, *e.g.,* the preservation of evidence. The right to seek reimbursement of one's costs in the case of a favorable award likewise constitutes a procedural right in that sense. *Hence there has to be an effective mechanism for protecting this right in order to render it meaningful*.\") (emphasis added); *see also id.*, \u00b6 67 (referencing the *Plama* tribunal's observation that provisional measures \"must relate to the requesting party's ability to have its claims considered and decided by the Arbitral Tribunal and *for any arbitral decision \u2026 to be effective and able to be carried out*\") (emphasis added).\n\n34.\n\nFramed as about the *ability to obtain effective relief,* however, there are potential broader consequences to recognizing the existence of such a \"right.\" The Tribunal accepts that respondent States have genuine concerns about their ability to enforce an eventual costs award against unsuccessful claimants, and some States are starting to raise the possibility of reforms to the ICSID system to protect themselves more systematically.49 But at the same time, such States would be unhappy to see a similar argument about a right to effective relief used against them, for example by claimants worried about collection risk associated with any final merits award of compensation. Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention imposes an obligation on \"*each party*\" (States and investors alike) to \"abide by and comply with the terms of the award,\" and Article 54(1) obliges all Contracting States to \"enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by [an] award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.\" But the Convention generally does not concern itself with *collection risk*, and indeed, Article 54(3) makes explicit that \"[e]xecution of the award\" is to be governed by national law, including (as confirmed in Article 55) national law related to the immunity of State assets.\n\n*See* T. Jones, \"ICSID to explore protections against \u2018judgment-proof claimants',\" *Global Arbitration Review*, October 21, 2016, available at http://globalarbitrationreview.com/article/1069674/icsid-to-explore-protections- against-\"judgment-proof-claimants (reporting ICSID press release promising, following a request from the Government of Panama, to \"seek the input of member states and report on the issue\" as part of its forthcoming rules amendment process).\n\n35.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, therefore, there is something analytically curious about the notion that an ICSID tribunal, while not empowered to protect a claimant's ability to collect on a possible merits award, nonetheless should intervene to protect a State's asserted \"right\" to collect on a possible costs award.50 For this reason, some tribunals have expressed doubt about whether there really is a \"right\" in play for security-for-costs that is entitled to protection under Article 47 and Rule 39(1).51 Others have found that there is such a protectable right, even if the standard for obtaining provisional measures to protect that right is an exacting one, requiring a demonstration of exceptional circumstances.52\n\n*See generally* *Burimi v. Albania*, Exhibit CL-088, \u00b6 49 (noting that the issue of non-payment is of concern both to respondents and claimants, since it occurs both with respect to damages awards against States and costs awards in their favor; the *Burimi* tribunal suggested that in this broader sense, non-payment \"poses a systemic risk to the arbitration of international investment disputes\").\n\n*See* *Maffezini v. Spain*, Exhibit RL-032, \u00b6 15 (\"we are unable to see what present rights are intended to be preserved\"); *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028 (dissenting opinion), \u00b6 1 (disagreeing with the majority that a security for costs order \"is encompassed within the class of \u2018provisional measures' which may \u2018be taken to preserve the rights' of Respondent\"); *Grynberg v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-030, note 9 (dissenting opinion) (\"the use of the words \u2018preserve' and \u2018preserved' in Article 47 and Rule 39 presupposes that the right to be preserved exists. Because Respondent has no existing right to an ultimate award of costs, the Tribunal is thus without jurisdiction\"); *see also* L.E. Peterson, \"In New Ruling, BIT Tribunal Holds That Alleged Right to Future Costs-Recovery is Not a Right Capable of Grounding an Interim \u2018Security for Costs' Request,\" *Investment Arbitration Reporter*, September 26, 2016, available at https://www.iareporter.com/articles/in-new-ruling-bit-tribunal-holds-that-alleged-right-to-future-costs- recovery-is-not-a-right-capable-of-grounding-an-interim-security-for-costs-request/ (reporting on unpublished decision in *Valla Verde Sociedad Financieras S.L. v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/18, Procedural Order No. 4 (September 21, 2016), reportedly disavowing the tribunal's power to order provisional measures \"to protect a right that as of yet does not exist\").\n\n*See EuroGas v. Slovak Republic*, Exhibit CL-090, \u00b6\u00b6 121, 123 (\"security for costs may only be granted in exceptional circumstances, \"for example, where abuse or serious misconduct has been evidenced\"; \"financial difficulties and third-party funding \u2026 do not necessarily constitute *per se* exceptional circumstances justifying \u2026 an order of security for costs\"); *Libananco v. Turkey*, Exhibit RL-029, \u00b6 57 (concluding that \"it would only be in the most extreme case \u2013 one in which an essential interest of either Party stood in danger of irreparable damage \u2013 that the possibility of granting security for costs should be entertained at all\"); *RSM v. Saint Lucia*, Exhibit RL-028, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54, 57; *Grynberg v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-030, \u00b6\u00b6 5.9-5.16, 5.18 (majority decision); *see also Commerce Group v. El Salvador*, Exhibit CL-089, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45 (finding similar authority, in the annulment context, from a Committee's \"inherent power\" \"[a]s the guardian of the integrity of the proceeding\").\n\n36.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal need not resolve this interesting question now, because even if in principle the \"right\" Italy asserts is one that would be deserving of protection in exceptional circumstances, Italy has not demonstrated that such circumstances exist. A recommendation of provisional measures should be issued only where doing so is *necessary* to preserve identified rights and *urgently* required for that purpose, in the sense that the requested measure is needed prior to issuance of an award. Tribunals also should ensure that the particular measures requested are *proportionate*, in the sense that they do not impose such undue burdens on the other party as to outweigh, in a balance of equities, the justification for granting them.53\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Burimi v. Albania*, Exhibit CL-088, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36 (citing prior cases).\n\n37.\n\nHere, Italy has not demonstrated that it is either necessary or urgent that Eskosol post security of $250,000 for a potential costs award in Italy's favor. The Tribunal accepts that Eskosol's bankruptcy makes it unlikely that it could pay an eventual costs award directly from its own funds. The Tribunal is also not aware (at least as of now) of any terms in Eskosol's third-party funding agreement that would require the funder to meet an eventual costs award rendered against Eskosol. However, the funder apparently has assisted Eskosol in obtaining the ATE Insurance policy,54 with a commencement date of October 8, 2015, for the specific purpose of \"protecting [Eskosol] from the risk of a potential adverse costs order or order for security for costs.\"55 The policy covers up to \"1,000,000 Euro in the aggregate for Opponent's Costs,\" with \"Opponent\" identified as \"Republic of Italy.\"56 In these circumstances, the amount presently sought by Italy as security is well below the threshold of Italy's costs already addressed by the policy. Italy has not sought leave to comment on the mechanics or sufficiency of the ATE Insurance policy. There has been no showing of any imminent need for a different mechanism or to secure amounts beyond the levels of the ATE policy.\n\nATE Insurance, Exhibit C-008 (stating on its front cover that the policy was arranged by The Judge Limited, with QBE Insurance (Europe) Limited as the subscribing insurer).\n\nATE Insurance, Exhibit C-008, Recital C.\n\nATE Insurance, Exhibit C-008, Schedule.\n\n38.\n\nMoreover, even if later in these proceedings Italy could demonstrate that its potentially recoverable legal costs surpassed the \u20ac1 million threshold of the ATE policy, it still would have to demonstrate that protecting its potential ability to recover such additional costs would be proportionate, given the potential burden on Eskosol of arranging security of additional amounts. As noted above, proportionality is a critical part of any provisional measures analysis, and a party seeking provisional measures must demonstrate that its need for the measures are not outweighed by the hardships to which the other party would be subjected if the measures are granted. This type of proportionality analysis would be particularly critical where the burden of a potential measure is one that is said to impinge, at least potentially, on a party's ability to pursue its claims or defenses at ICSID.57 A tribunal should not lightly recommend a provisional measure that could impede access to justice.\n\n*See* *Hamester v. Ghana*, Exhibit CL-091, \u00b6 17 (noting the tribunal's prior ruling that \"there was a serious risk that an order for security for costs would stifle the Claimant's claims and that, in any event, it had not been shown that the measures requested were necessary and urgent\"); *Grynberg v. Grenada*, Exhibit RL-030, \u00b6 5.19 (\"it is simply not part of the ICSID dispute resolution system that an investor's claim should be heard only upon the establishment of a sufficient financial standing of the investor to meet a possible costs award\"); *Burimi v. Albania*, Exhibit CL-088, \u00b6 41 (\"Even if there were more persuasive evidence \u2026 concerning the Claimants' ability or willingness to pay a possible award on costs, the Tribunal would be reluctant to impose on the Claimants what amounts to an additional financial requirement as a condition for the case to proceed.\"); *Commerce Group v. El Salvador*, Exhibit CL-089, \u00b6 52 (expressing concern that a grant of security \"might seriously affect the Applicant's right to seek annulment of the award\").\n\n39.\n\nFor these reasons, Italy's request that the Tribunal \"[d]irect Eskosol to post an irrevocable bank guarantee or analogous security in the amount of $250,000\" is hereby denied.58 Italy's alternative request, that the Tribunal \"direct Eskosol to procure from such third party \u2013 proved to have demonstrably adequate assets \u2013 a legally binding undertaking to pay any costs order entered against Eskosol,\"59 is also denied.\n\nRequest, Section V.\n\nRequest, Section V.\n\n**B. Disclosure Application**\n-----------------------------\n\n***1. Italy's position***\n-------------------------\n\n40.\n\nWith its Security Application, Italy submitted also a Disclosure Application, alleging that \"in order to protect its rights Italy needs to know whether the Claimant is funded by a third party and whether such third party would be financially sound as well as committed to execute a cost award adopted by the Tribunal against Eskosol.\"60\n\nRequest, \u00b6 37.\n\n41.\n\nIn making the Disclosure Application, Italy relies on the decision adopted in *Muhammet \u00c7ap v. Turkmenistan*, where the tribunal granted the requested order for disclosure on the basis, *inter alia*, that this information was needed by the respondent to file its request for security for costs.61\n\nResponse, \u00b6 40, citing *Muhammet \u00c7ap & Sehil In\u015faat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/6, Procedural Order No. 3, June 12, 2015, Exhibit RL-033, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10, 12-13 (***Muhammet \u00c7ap v. Turkmenistan***).\n\n***2. Eskosol's position***\n---------------------------\n\n42.\n\nEskosol contends that Italy's document production request is now moot \"in the light of Eskosol's confirmation that it requires external funding to have access to justice here.\"62 It also notes that, \"given the existence of the ATE insurance, the commercial soundness of the funder is immaterial to Italy's position.\"\n\nResponse, \u00b6 50.\n\n43.\n\nRegarding the funder's commitment to execute a cost award, Eskosol's position is as summarized in Section II.A.2.b above.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Eskosol that the issues raised by the Disclosure Application are largely moot, in that Eskosol has now answered Italy's initial question, namely \"whether the Claimant is funded by a third party,\" as well as at least part of the second question, \"whether such third party would be financially sound as well as committed to execute a cost award adopted by the Tribunal against Eskosol.\"63 It is now clear that the funder has made arrangements to support any cost award against Eskosol up to the amount of \u20ac1 million. It is neither necessary nor urgent at this point to investigate whether the funder would be in a position to arrange (or willing to arrange) insurance coverage or other security for a potentially higher amount of costs. Such an investigation would be highly premature.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 37.\n\n45.\n\nFor these reasons, Italy's request for a provisional measure directing Eskosol to submit Exhibits C-005 and C-006 without redactions, \"to permit \u2026 confirmation whether a funding third party did commit itself to cover Eskosol['s] costs of these proceedings,\" is hereby denied.64\n\nRequest, Section V.\n\n**III.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision addresses the request filed on 4 February 2019 by the Respondent, the Italian Republic (\"**Italy**\"), \"for an award declaring immediate termination\" of this arbitration (the \"**Termination Request**\"). Italy's Termination Request seeks dismissal of all claims brought by the Claimant, Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione (\"**Eskosol**\"), on the basis of a Declaration dated 15 January 2019 by 22 Member States of the European Union (\"**EU**\"), which is entitled \"Declaration of the Governments of the Member States on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union\" (the \"**January 2019 Declaration**\").\n\n2.\n\nAs the title of the January 2019 Declaration reveals, its principal subject is the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\") issued on 6 March 2018 in Case C-284/16, *Achmea v. Slovak Republic* (the \"***Achmea*** **Judgment**\"). The *Achmea* Judgment also features prominently in Italy's pending jurisdictional objection (the \"**intra-EU objection**\") based on the alleged inapplicability of the Energy Charter Treaty (the \"**ECT**\") to disputes between investors of one EU Member State and another EU Member State (\"**intra-EU disputes**\"). As discussed further in the procedural summary in Section II below, Italy lodged this jurisdictional objection long before the *Achmea* Judgment, but both it and Eskosol (the \"**Parties**\") subsequently addressed the implications of the *Achmea* Judgment in both written and oral submissions. The Parties also submitted their respective views of the January 2019 Declaration.\n\n3.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission (the \"**Commission**\") sought and was granted the opportunity, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, both to file a written submission as a nondisputing party prior to the *Achmea* Judgment (the \"**Commission Submission**,\" dated 6 March 2017), and later to file an updated submission addressing the legal consequences of the *Achmea* Judgment for an intra-EU dispute under the ECT (the \"**Commission Update**,\" dated 26 October 2018).\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that early in these proceedings, through its Procedural Order No. 4 dated 1 August 2017, it denied Italy's request to bifurcate these proceedings in order to address its jurisdictional objections prior to the merits, and to suspend these proceedings until the CJEU rendered its decision in the *Achmea* case. The case has thus proceeded in a plenary fashion, through a full hearing on jurisdiction and the merits and full post-hearing briefs.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal nonetheless has decided to address now both the Termination Request and Italy's closely related intra-EU objection. First, there is no question that these should be addressed in tandem. While the two developments at issue in the Termination Request - the January 2019 Declaration and the *Achmea* Judgment on which it is based - certainly are new developments since the time the Tribunal previously decided to join the intra-EU objection to the merits, the Tribunal does not believe they fundamentally change the jurisdictional questions that already were before it, based on Italy's intra-EU objection and the Commission's submissions. However, explaining why that is so requires the Tribunal to set out its views on the substance of the intra-EU issue under the ECT, and not just its views on the more recent events (the *Achmea* Judgment and the January 2019 Declaration). For this reason, it is not procedurally efficient to rule only on the Termination Request, without also ruling at the same time on the underlying jurisdictional objection.\n\n6.\n\nSecond, the alternative to deciding both issues now in a stand-alone Decision would be to defer addressing even the Termination Request for some time, until the issuance of the Final Award. Numerous factors weigh against that approach, including the sense of urgency claimed by Italy in its Termination Request, the Tribunal's readiness now to announce its ruling on Italy's related intra-EU objection, and the important attention that the Commission, as well as the other EU Member States and the investment arbitration community as a whole, have paid to these issues both before and even more after the *Achmea* Judgment. On balance, the Tribunal therefore considers it more appropriate to rule expeditiously on these important jurisdictional issues, rather than holding that aspect of its decision for later while it continues to work on other unrelated issues to be addressed in the Final Award.\n\n**II. THE RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out here only the procedural history relevant to the two issues addressed in this decision, namely Italy's Termination Request and its related intra-EU objection. A more comprehensive procedural history of this arbitration will be set out in the Award.\n\n8.\n\nFirst, on 11 December 2015, ICSID received Eskosol's Request for Arbitration dated 9 December 2015 (the \"**RFA**\"). The Secretary-General registered the RFA on 22 December 2015, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was subsequently deemed constituted on 19 October 2016, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 2 December 2016, by teleconference.\n\n9.\n\nOn 18 November 2016, Italy filed a request under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), asking that the proceedings be dismissed for manifest lack of legal merits (the \"**Rule 41(5) Request**\"). This request raised four objections of a jurisdictional nature, but not the intra-EU objection. Pursuant to an agreed schedule, Eskosol filed its response to the Rule 41(5) Request on 23 December 2016, Italy filed its reply on 13 January 2017, and Eskosol filed its rejoinder on 1 February 2017. The Tribunal held a hearing in Paris on 8 February 2017 in connection with the Rule 41(5) Request, and subsequently rendered its decision on that Request on 20 March 2017.\n\n10.\n\nIn the meantime, on 16 January 2017, the Commission had filed its Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (the \"**Commission Application**\"), on which the Parties submitted their respective observations on 3 February 2017. On 10 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 granting the Commission permission to file a written submission as a non-disputing party. The Commission Submission was filed on 6 March 2017.\n\n11.\n\nOn 9 May 2017, Eskosol filed its Memorial (the \"**Memorial**\"), which addressed *inter alia* the Commission Submission and the intra-EU nature of this dispute.\n\n12.\n\nOn 7 July 2017, Italy filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Requests for Bifurcation and Suspension (the \"**Memorial on Jurisdiction**\"), which provided further briefing on the jurisdictional objections Italy had raised in its Rule 41(5) Request, and also presented out its intra-EU objection, *i.e.*, that the ECT does not apply to intra-EU disputes. Section V of the Memorial on Jurisdiction set out Italy's request for bifurcation to address its jurisdictional objections as a preliminary matter, and an additional request to suspend these proceedings until the CJEU issued its decision in the then-pending *Achmea* case (the \"**Bifurcation Request**\"). Pursuant to an agreed schedule, Eskosol filed its Response to Respondent's Bifurcation Request on 28 July 2017 (the \"**Bifurcation Response**\"). On 1 August 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, dismissing Italy's Bifurcation Request with detailed reasons to follow, pursuant to an agreement on such an expedited procedure reflected in Procedural Order No. 1, Annex A, n.3. On 15 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, providing the detailed reasoning for its decision in Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n13.\n\nAlso on 15 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, in which it provided the detailed reasoning for its decision on the Commission's Application in Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n14.\n\nOn 27 October 2017, Italy filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\"), which maintained (but did not further brief) the jurisdictional objections filed in its Memorial on Jurisdiction.1 On 2 March 2018, Eskosol filed its Statement of Reply (the \"**Reply**\"), which incorporated by reference (but did not further brief) its position on the jurisdictional objections set forth in its Bifurcation Response.2 On 25 May 2018, Italy filed its Rejoinder (the \"**Rejoinder**\"), which addressed both jurisdiction and the merits, including among other things a discussion of the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment rendered on 6 March 2018. On 15 June 2018, Eskosol filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the \"**Rejoinder on Jurisdiction**\"), which completed the written stage of proceedings prior to the oral hearing. The Parties nonetheless agreed to add to the record, before the hearing, certain recent legal authorities including decisions of other investment arbitration tribunals on intra-EU objections.3\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 226.\n\nReply, \u00b6 17.\n\n*See* ICSID Secretariat letter to the Parties, dated 18 September 2018.\n\n15.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held in Paris from 24 through 26 September 2018 (the \"**Hearing**\"). Both Parties presented oral argument on the jurisdictional issues in the case, including the intra-EU objection.\n\n16.\n\nOn 3 October 2018, the Commission offered to update its prior submission in light of the *Achmea* Judgment. The Parties filed observations on this offer on 15 October 2018. On 18 October 2018, the Secretariat communicated the Tribunal's decision to accept the Commission's offer subject to certain page and time limitations, and with the understanding that the Parties would be able to comment on its updated submission within the framework of their post-hearing briefs, subject to reasonable schedule adjustments. On 26 October 2018, the Commission filed the Commission Update.\n\n17.\n\nOn 3 December 2018, the Tribunal resolved certain disputes regarding transcript correction, and the final corrected transcripts were circulated on 14 December 2018.\n\n18.\n\nOn 17 December 2018, the Parties again agreed to add to the record certain additional legal authorities reflecting decisions of other investment arbitration tribunals on intra-EU objections.\n\n19.\n\nThe Parties then filed their respective post-hearing briefs, dated 21 December 2018 (\"**Eskosol PHB**\" and \"**Italy PHB**\"), followed by cost submissions dated 11 January 2019 and responses to certain questions about the cost submissions on 15 and 18 January 2019.\n\n20.\n\nOn 4 February 2019, Italy filed its Termination Request, citing the January 2019 Declaration. Eskosol responded by letter dated 18 February 2019 (the \"**Termination Response**\"), Italy replied on 26 February 2019 (the \"**Termination Reply**\"), and Eskosol further responded on 1 March 2019 (the \"**Termination Rejoinder**\").\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Parties' positions with respect to the intra-EU issues in this case have developed during the course of the proceedings in response to each other's arguments, the Commission's two submissions, and various supervening events including the *Achmea* Judgment and the January 2019 Declaration. Not surprisingly, the Parties also organized their submissions differently, emphasizing different themes set out under different subtopic headers. In order to provide some analytical logic to the summary of their positions, the Tribunal organizes this summary not by the Parties' varying structures but rather by the same analytical structure that the Tribunal adopts for its analysis in Section V. This begins with the Parties' arguments about interpretation of the ECT itself; followed by their arguments about the implications of various EU law developments, including in chronological order the progressive development of the EU Treaties, the *Achmea* Judgment and the January 2019 Declaration; and finally concludes with a few words on the subject of enforceability of awards.\n\n22.\n\nAs always in a synthesis of lengthy submissions, it is possible that the Tribunal will not reflect each point the Parties made. This summary is not intended to be all-inclusive, but simply to provide some high-level background about the Parties' arguments to lay the groundwork for the analysis that follows. The fact that a particular argument may not be reflected here should not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider it. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered all aspects of their written and oral submissions and considered all contentions presented in the course of these proceedings.\n\n**A. Italy's Position**\n-----------------------\n\n**1. Interpretation of the ECT**\n--------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nItaly begins from the proposition that all States relevant to this dispute were EU Member States at the time they ratified the ECT,4 and therefore the relevant question is \"to what extent the EU and EU Member States bound themselves signing the ECT,\" which is an \"issue... of intent.\"5 Italy accepts that its intent should be determined by interpretation of the ECT consistent with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), beginning with an assessment \"in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose,\"6 but also taking into account preparatory works and subsequent State practice.\n\nEskosol invokes the ECT on the basis of the Belgian nationality of Blusun S.A., its 80% shareholder. Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Italy, Belgium and the EU (at that time known as the European Communities) each signed the ECT in 1994 and ratified it in 1997.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 165.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 166-168.\n\n24.\n\nBeginning with the \"letter\" of the ECT, Italy emphasizes that under its Article 1, the Contracting Parties are both individual States and the EU as a \"regional economic integration organization\" (\"**REIO**\") to whom EU Member States \"have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matter[s].\"7 Since the ECT defines an REIO's \"Area\" as \"the Areas of the member states of such Organization, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organization,\" this means that \"an allocation of competences within the Union... cannot rely on geographical boundaries, but rather on competences by matter.\"8 Article 25 of the ECT further recognizes that Contracting Parties who extend certain trade and investment liberalization to one another by virtue of an \"Economic Integration Agreement\" (\"**EIA**\") like the EU are not required by the ECT to extend the same benefits to non-EIA States.9 Finally, Italy interprets the conflict rule for successive treaties set out in Article 16 of the ECT as requiring deference from the outset to the earlier EU Treaties, since those \"represent[] a more developed and articulated legal system, which is doubtless more favorable and offers more articulated forms of protection\" than does the ECT.10 As a result, nothing in the ECT's Part III (on investment promotion and protection) or Part V (on dispute settlement) may be \"construed to derogate from any provision of the EU Treaties as for investment promotion and protection, or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under the EU Treaties.\"11 In Italy's view, all of these provisions lead to \"the conclusion that ... Contracting Parties signed the ECT under the mutual understanding that this would not apply to [an] intra-EU situation.\"12\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169 (quoting ECT Article 1(3)).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 171-172 (quoting ECT Article 1(10)).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 173-175 (referring to ECT Article 25).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 176-177.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 177.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 178.\n\n25.\n\nItaly contends that the same conclusion is required by the context, purpose and objectives of the ECT.13 It refers in particular to a decision at the Energy Charter Conference with respect to ECT Articles 24(4)(a) and 25, permitting a non-EIA investor to obtain EIA benefits by virtue of registered offices in or certain other links to EIA territory, and a related Declaration by the EU and its Member States with respect to Article 25. In Italy's view, these steps \"define[d] the criteria under which a legal entity of a non-EU Member State could benefit of the rules internal to the EU,\" and \"[i]n order to avoid double protection to the same situations,\" it follows that the intent must have been that such investors could *only* pursue remedies available under EU law, with \"no right to apply\" alternatively the ECT's own dispute resolution mechanism set forth in its Article 26. Italy suggests that it would be \"fully redundant\" to regulate access to EU law protections if the ECT's own dispute resolution procedures were available equally to both EU investors and non-EU investors, \"since the EU law ... already contemplates protection for entities established in the Union.\"14\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 179.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 180-184.\n\n26.\n\nWith reference to Article 32 of the VCLT, Italy invokes the \"preparatory work of the [ECT] and the circumstances of its conclusion,\" which confirm a goal of integrating the energy sectors of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe with those of Europe, and \"surely not to regulate the EU internal market for energy,\" which already was under way through other instruments.15 Finally, Italy refers to \"the practice of EU Member States and the EU,\" which \"has always been consistent\" with a reading of the ECT as not extending investor-State arbitration to \"a purely intra-EU situation.\"16\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 186-189.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 190-183.\n\n27.\n\nItaly concludes from all the above that \"the ECT does not apply *ab initio* to intra-[EU] situations because this was not the intention of the Contracting Parties,\" and therefore Eskosol cannot invoke Article 26 of the ECT as the basis for jurisdiction in this dispute.17 Put simply, in Italy's Rejoinder, \"it did not intend to include intra-EU disputes within the scope of Article 26,\" and \"it never acquiesced, let alone agree[d], to the arbitration of ECT claims in intra-EU scenarios.\"18\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 194.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.\n\n28.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Italy adds that the offer in Article 26(3) to arbitrate ECT disputes must also be interpreted in light of the applicable law provision of Article 26(6), under which \"[a] tribunal... shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law,\" a governing law provision that in Italy's view applies equally to matters of jurisdiction as to matters of merits.19 As EU law forms part of international law, EU law must apply \"when a tribunal assesses the applicability of the arbitration agreement and of the ECT at large in intra-EU disputes.\"20 It follows that even as a matter of ECT interpretation itself, since EU law \"prevents Member States from contracting the obligation to arbitrate claims that could have repercussions on EU law issues,\" then \"Italy's offer to arbitrate investment disputes has thus *always* been inapplicable ... to intra-EU disputes,\" based on propositions of EU law that have been codified \"*from the very beginning*.\"21\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 90; *see also* Tr. 1, 104:10-14.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92 (emphasis added).\n\n**2. EU Law Developments**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. Progressive Development of EU Treaties**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nItaly argues that even if the Tribunal does not accept its interpretation of the \"intention *ab initio* of the Contracting Parties\" to the ECT, the progressive development of the EU Treaties - and in particular the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 - requires the exclusion of intra-EU disputes from the ECT's scope.22 Italy emphasizes that under the Lisbon Treaty, direct foreign investment was \"added to the common commercial policy, that is traditionally an exclusive competence\" of the EU, with the result that EU Member States \"cannot undertake *inter se* agreements in those matters ..., which only EU law can regulate.\"23 Otherwise stated, the Lisbon Treaty \"strongly modified the balance of external competences of Member States and the Union, respectively, and affected the general understanding of external commitments, since it is necessary to ensure uniformity of rules within the Union, of which international treaties signed by the Union become a part.\"24\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 195.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 196.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 200; *see also id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 201-202.\n\n30.\n\nItaly invokes the international law conflict of rules mechanism in Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT, under which a subsequent treaty between some of the parties to an earlier treaty prevails over a prior one relating to the \"same subject matter\" to the extent of any incompatibility.25 Italy contends that in order for Article 30 to have \"concrete utility,\" the concept of \"same subject matter\" must be viewed expansively and not as requiring an \"exact coincidence of provisions or even of objectives.\"26 It argues that \"[a]lthough the EU provisions on internal market ... do not 'deal' technically with promotion and protection of investments ..., they share the same efforts of integration,\" and thus VCLT Article 30(4)(a) should apply in this case.27\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206, 214.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 207 (discussing a 2006 ILC Report on Fragmentation of International Law).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 208-209.\n\n31.\n\nItaly also invokes VCLT Article 30(2), which provides that \"[w]hen a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\"28 It recalls Article 16 of the ECT, which by its terms applies to subsequent and not just prior international agreements, and contends that nothing in Part III or V of the ECT therefore may be construed to derogate from EU law as developed through the Lisbon Treaty.29\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 210-213; *see also* Tr. 1, 105:5-8 (invoking the \"*lex posterior* principle\" in favor of the Lisbon Treaty).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 211-213.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, Italy suggests that \"by adhering to the Lisbon Treaty,\" EU Member States effectively \"modified\" the ECT, to the extent of any intra-EU obligations they might be viewed as having undertaken.30 It invokes Article 41 of the VCLT, referring to agreements by certain parties to a multilateral treaty to modify it *inter se*, and contends that the modifications effected by the Lisbon Treaty as among EU Member States did not affect the enjoyment of ECT rights by any other ECT parties, and that no notification of such modifications was required.31\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 197.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 216, 218-222.\n\n33.\n\nAccordingly, Italy contends that as a matter of *international law*, the ECT cannot be viewed in the wake of the Lisbon Treaty as covering disputes \"internal to the EU,\"32 which are \"regulated by Union law and heard within the European judicial system.\"33 The same conclusion would be warranted *under EU law*, under which EU law has primacy over any national law, the CJEU and Member State courts cooperate on matters of EU law by way of the preliminary ruling mechanism established by Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\"), and only these authorities have jurisdiction to hear claims against Member States that acted in violation of Union law.34 In the specific context of investment, Italy repeats that in the wake of the Lisbon Treaty, the Union has exclusive competence to conclude agreements on foreign direct investment;35 EU law comprehensively governs and protects all steps of the life cycle of an investment;36 and EU law does not allow Member States to agree to investment protection rules *inter se*, outside the EU legal order.37 This includes any agreement to dispute settlement outside the EU judicial framework, which is \"not conceivable in the relationship between Member States.\"38 Italy adds that pursuant to Article 344 TFEU, Member States cannot submit a dispute concerning interpretation or application of the EU Treaties to any method of settlement other than provided by EU law, including to arbitral tribunals which may not refer a preliminary question to the CJEU.39 It is for that reason, Italy explains, that the Commission expressly declared - when signing the International Energy Charter of 2015 on behalf of the EU - that the Charter's dispute settlement mechanisms \"cannot be construed so as to mean that any such [arbitral] mechanism would become applicable in relations\" between EU Member States.40 The same conclusion necessarily must apply to arbitration under the ECT.41\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 222.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 223.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 225-228.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 235.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 241-250.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 251-255.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 256.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 258-260; *see also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64 (discussing the CJEU's decision in the *Mox Plant* case), \u00b6\u00b6 66-67 (discussing the CJEU's opinion 1/09 regarding an international court for patent disputes).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 262.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 265.\n\n**b. The** ***Achmea*** **Judgment**\n------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nItaly contends that the *Achmea* Judgment \"sealed the debate\" that ECT arbitration is \"unavailable when a EU company sues a EU host State,\"42 because the CJEU \"confirmed that the legal order of European Union does not permit intra-EU investor-State disputes to be resolved through arbitration of the kind envisaged in investment protection treaties.\"43 This conclusion is binding in an arbitration governed by international law, because under that law, the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal can arise only when there has been a \"valid offer[] to arbitrate\" made by each party and subsequently accepted by the other.44 Italy's offer to arbitrate under the ECT could not validly have extended to intra-EU disputes. Moreover, the ECT requires EU law to be taken into account for jurisdictional purposes, because \"EU law, being based on a treaty, forms part of international law,\" as the tribunal in *Electrabel v.

The January 2019 Declaration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nWith respect to the January 2019 Declaration, Italy observes that both Italy and Belgium have joined the 22 EU Member States signing that document, which contains *inter alia* the following statements:\n\n[I]nternational agreements concluded by the Union, including the Energy Charter Treaty, are an integral part of the EU legal order and must therefore be compatible with the Treaties. Arbitral tribunals have interpreted the Energy Charter Treaty as also containing an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between Member States. Interpreted in such a manner, that clause would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied..\n\n... With regard to agreements concluded between Member States... [t]he same result [on primacy of Union law] follows also under general public international law, in particular from the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties and customary international law (*lex posterior*)....\n\n... By the present declaration, Member States inform investment arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the Achmea judgment, as set out in this declaration, in all pending intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings brought either under bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States or under the Energy Charter Treaty.57\n\nItaly further observes that footnote 2 of the Declaration specifies, for the sake of clarity, that \"[f]or the Energy Charter Treaty, its systemic interpretation in conformity with the Treaties precludes intra-EU investor-State arbitration.\"58\n\nTermination Request, pp. 1-2 (quoting the January 2019 Declaration).\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 3.\n\n40.\n\nItaly contends that \"[g]iven that arbitral tribunals are bound by the will of the Contracting Parties,\" the Tribunal should \"duly take the abovementioned Declaration into account in conformity with Article 31(2)(b) VCLT and Article 31(3)(a) VCLT, and consequently... terminate the proceedings accordingly.\"59 In its view, the Declaration is \"a binding instrument emanating from sovereign States,\" amounting to a \"shared understanding... regarding the interpretation of the ECT,\" and such \"interpretative declarations... provide an authentic interpretation\" of Article 26 of the ECT \"as far as the Contracting Parties signing the Declaration are concerned.\"60 As a result, it is no longer \"a matter of discussion how to interpret *Achmea*,\" but rather a requirement to acknowledge that the Member States signing the Declaration interpret the *Achmea* Judgment as applying to the ECT, with the \"consequence of prohibiting any pending or future arbitration procedure concerning the ECT.\"61\n\nTermination Request, p. 2.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 4.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\n41.\n\nItaly adds that it is irrelevant that several EU Member States have chosen not to sign, since both Italy and Belgium did so, and \"each declaration can be formally broken down into a bundle of unilateral declarations amounting to a shared understanding between\" them.62 Even multilateral treaties like the ECT reflect \"reciprocal obligations,\" and here the two relevant States have confirmed reciprocally their interpretation of the ECT's dispute settlement clause,63 with the effect that \"the binding nature of the Declaration affecting reciprocal obligations ... cannot be challenged.\"64 According to Italy, this also must be taken as having \"been always their understanding of such clause,\"65 since the exercise of \"interpreting\" is not the same as revising, but rather involves clarifying the meaning and scope attributed to a particular provision.66 Such a clarification does not constitute a retroactive withdrawal of consent, but simply \"confirm[s] how the ECT should have always been interpreted in their understanding.\"67\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 20; *see also id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 (referring to certain reports by the International Law Commission (\"**ILC**\"), **RL-102** and **RL-103**).\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 31 (citing **RL-103**), \u00b6 38.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 45.\n\n42.\n\nIt follows, in Italy's view, that an arbitration tribunal \"has to interpret the treaty acknowledging the existence of a specific interpretative declaration by one or more Contracting Party/ies.\"68 Stated most plainly, \"[s]uch reading is binding on the Tribunal.\"69\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 29.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 45.\n\n**B. Eskosol's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Interpretation of the ECT**\n--------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nEskosol rejects Italy's contention that it never agreed in the ECT to arbitrate disputes with investors from other EU Member States. Eskosol starts with \"the plain terms\" of Article 26 of the ECT, and in particular the \"interplay between\" Article 26(1), which identifies the scope of \"disputes\" covered by the Article, and Article 26(7), which offers arbitration to resolve those disputes.70 Under Article 26(1), the relevant \"disputes\" are those between a \"Contracting Party\" and an investor of \"another Contracting Party.\" Under the definition of \"Contracting Party\" in Article 1(2) - under which a \"Contracting Party means *a state or* Regional Economic Integration Organization\" - the individual EU Member States \"are each considered to be Contracting Parties.\"71 In other words, Italy and Belgium \"each voluntarily signed, ratified, and agreed to be bound by the ECT ...\"72\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 228.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 229; Eskosol PHB, \u00b6 72.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 66.\n\n44.\n\nIn Eskosol's view, this conclusion is not affected by the fact that the EU is also a \"Contracting Party\" to the ECT, by virtue of being an REIO,73 since \"[t]he fact that the EU is a Contracting Party does not deprive Italy and Belgium of their own status ... as a Contracting Party in their own right.\"74 Rather, in the words of the tribunal in *Eiser v. Spain*, \"[b]oth the EU and [its] Member States can have legal standing as respondents in a claim under the ECT.\"75\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 231.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232 (citing decisions in several ECT cases); Bifurcation Response, \u00b6 66.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 69 (quoting *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.a.r.l. v.

Spain* that \"Article 1(10) of the ECT, when defining the term 'Area', refers to both the area of the [ECT] Contracting States... as well as the area of the EU .... Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that, when referring to investments made 'in the area' of one Contracting Party, Article 26(1) refers to both.... Whether 'area' refers to one or the other depends on the content of the claim and the entity against which the claim is pursued ....\"78 In this case, Eskosol notes, it \"is not suing the EU and thus there is and cannot be identity of 'Areas'.\"79\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 231 (quoting Commission Submission, \u00b6 22).\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 65 (quoting Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 172).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 233 (quoting *Charanne and Construction Investments v.

Since Article 26 of the ECT \"on its face, does not exclude intra-EU disputes,\" resort to supplementary materials cannot be said to \"confirm\" such exclusion \"within the meaning of Article 32 of the VCLT.\"93 Nor is there anything \"ambiguous or obscure\" in the ECT that even permits resort to supplementary materials under Article 32(a) of the VCLT. Eskosol quotes the *Charanne* tribunal to the effect that \"the terms of the [ECT] are clear and do not justify recourse to supplementary means of interpretation that could lead to add to the ECT an implied disconnection clause in respect of intra-EU disputes.\"94 Moreover, application of the ECT to intra-EU disputes does not amount to \"a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\" under Article 32(b) of the VCLT.95\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 73.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 74 (quoting *Charanne*, \u00b6 437 (**CL-82**)); *see also* Eskosol PHB, \u00b6 68 (\"Any reading of an implicit carve-out would significantly depart from the original meaning of the text used in the ECT and related instruments\") and \u00b6 79 (rejecting resort to \"selected *travaux preparatoires*... given the clarity of the terms of the ECT\").\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 75.\n\n49.\n\nFinally, with respect to Italy's invocation of the \"practice\" of EU Member States to protest intra-EU claims under the ECT, Eskosol asserts that this cannot \"lead to an interpretation that is at odds with the terms of the ECT.\"96\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 76.\n\n**2. EU Law Developments**\n--------------------------\n\n**a.

In its view, the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty \"do not relate to the same subject matter, nor are they incompatible.\"98 Further, even if the two were considered as having the same subject matter, the conflict rule in Article 16(2) of the ECT - and not the general conflict rule in Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT - would apply \"by operation of the *lex specialis* principle.\"99 Eskosol in any event questions which is really the later treaty, given that \"Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have existed in the same form prior to the ECT,\" and \"[t]herefore it is not clear that the EU Treaties and specifically those provisions are the successive treaties to the ECT, nor for that matter that this is truly the type of situation in which Article 30(4)(a) VCLT was intended to apply.\"100\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 77 & V.C; *see also* Tr. 1, 67:15-68:5 (contending that Italy is \"inviting this Tribunal to look through the wrong end of the telescope, meaning to start with EU law, and then to use EU law to inform and govern the Tribunal's interpretation of the ECT...

First, as a threshold matter, \"a decision by the ECJ is not binding upon this Tribunal, which under the ICSID framework operates on an international plane, insulated from the intervention of other courts.\"107 Indeed, Eskosol warns against Italy's effort to \"persuade the Tribunal to abdicate its decision-making function and defer to a decision of a regional judicial body formed under a different treaty.\"108 Eskosol emphasizes that the Tribunal's mandate is to interpret and apply the ECT, and it \"is not bound by EU law any more than it is bound by the domestic law of any given state.\"109 To the contrary, \"each of this Tribunal and the ECJ are judicial decision-making entities created by virtue of the provisions of the respective treaties from which they each derive their jurisdiction and authority,\" and the decisions of one are not binding on the other.110\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 90; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 76; Tr. 1, 77:2-10.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 61.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 61; *see also* Tr. 1, 68:18-22 (\"Achmea changes nothing for the purposes of this Tribunal's jurisdictional analysis.

Eskosol emphasizes that under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"[w]hen the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" Eskosol notes that Italy filed a notice to withdraw from the ECT on 31 December 2014, and \"yet - of course - [it] has not pursued an argument that such withdrawal could amount to a withdrawal of [Italy]'s consent to these proceedings. Similarly, by no stretch could a decision of the ECJ pursuant to the TFEU amount to withdrawal of consent by [Italy] under the ECT.\"117\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 80.\n\n56.\n\nFinally, Eskosol rejects Italy's reference to the issue of enforceability in the face of the *Achmea* Judgment, deeming it \"pure speculation\" that an award issued by this Tribunal under the ECT would not be enforceable within the EU. \"However, more fundamentally, questions of enforceability in certain jurisdictions should not impact a tribunal's jurisdictional analysis.\"118\n\nEskosol PHB, \u00b6 99 & n. 152 (quoting *Vattenfall*, \u00b6\u00b6 230-231 (**CL-193**)); Tr. 1, 78:15-25.\n\n**c. The January 2019 Declaration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nEskosol rejects Italy's interpretation of the January 2019 Declaration. It observes that the Declaration contains \"no analysis\" of the *Achmea* Judgment, but simply a \"self-serving\" statement of view about the \"alleged consequences\" of that Judgment.119 That statement is \"extraneous to the ECT,\" in the sense that it is not authorized by any provision of the ECT, and Italy's invocation of it constitutes an \"effort to retroactively invalidate its consent to arbitrate, which has already been accepted by Claimant here, ... inconsistent with international law.\"120\n\nTermination Response, p. 1.\n\nTermination Response, p. 1.\n\n58.\n\nEskosol adds that not all EU Member States have signed the Declaration, and in fact six other EU Member States have declared it inappropriate to express a view on the compatibility of EU law and the ECT at this time, based on the *Achmea* Judgment's silence about the ECT.121 In any event, even for the States signing the Declaration, at most that document reflects an interpretation of *Achmea*, which the Tribunal can interpret for itself. Moreover, the Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ECT and ICSID, and the Member States signing the Declaration \"do not purport to issue [it]... on the basis of any authority or right granted to Contracting States under the ECT or ICSID.\"122 As for the \"so-called will of Belgium and Italy to self-declare that their offer to arbitrate under the present circumstances is invalid,\" Eskosol contends that this does not bind the Tribunal for purposes of jurisdiction, but rather \"[i]n accordance with the principle of comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence, the Tribunal has the power to determine its own jurisdiction in accordance with the ECT and ICSID.\"123\n\nTermination Response, p. 2.\n\nTermination Response, p. 3.\n\nTermination Response, p. 3.\n\n59.\n\nEskosol also rejects the suggestion that Articles 31(2)(b) and 31(3)(a) of the VLCT could guide the Tribunal's analysis with respect to the January 2019 Declaration. Those provisions involve interpretation of treaties, but the Declaration \"does not purport to interpret a single provision or term of the relevant treaty, the ECT,\" but merely declares the invalidity of one of its provisions.124 This is \"at most a political declaration,\"125 which in Eskosol's view \"cannot overcome the plain meaning of the terms and provisions of the ECT, which provide no carve out for intra-EU disputes\" and moreover already regulates any possible conflict with EU law, by virtue of its own Article 16(2).126 Eskosol characterizes Italy's attempt to apply the January 2019 Declaration to bind the Tribunal in interpreting Article 26 of the ECT as \"highly remarkable, and a significant departure from a common-sense VCLT-led process of interpretation.\"127 In fact, Eskosol contends that the January 2019 Declaration is not an interpretation at all, but rather an \"attempted late-stage 'reservation,'\" which is prohibited by the unambiguous prohibition on reservations set forth in Article 46 of the ECT.128 Eskosol contrasts the January 2019 Declaration with those issued at the time the ECT was concluded, which in its view were intended at the time of signing to be the \"final word\" on the ECT's scope and obligations. These were far different from a \"declaration issued 25 years after concluding a treaty in circumstances where a State seeks to absolve itself from liability in on-going arbitration proceedings.\"129\n\nTermination Response, p. 3; Termination Rejoinder, p. 1.\n\nTermination Rejoinder, p. 1.\n\nTermination Response, p. 3; Termination Rejoinder, p. 5.\n\nTermination Rejoinder, p. 1.\n\nTermination Rejoinder, pp. 2, 3.\n\nTermination Rejoinder, pp. 3, 4.\n\n60.\n\nWith respect to such ongoing proceedings, Eskosol finally emphasizes that it accepted Italy's offer to arbitrate in the ECT in 2015, more than three years before the January 2019 Declaration was issued. \"The idea that a Respondent could retroactively withdraw or vitiate its consent to arbitration on the eve of an award through a self-serving declaration would clearly run contrary to the investor protections contained in the ECT.\"130 For this reason, Eskosol \"queries the relevance and applicability\" of ILC guidelines on interpretative declarations, which were \"produced for the purposes of determination of State-to-State obligations in the sphere of public international law\" and \"cannot be directly transposed\" to investment treaty arbitration, where investors are relying on treaty provisions to assert their rights and have accepted consent by commencing an arbitration. In that context, allowing States power to issue \"self-serving 'interpretative declarations\" ... would have the potential to undermine the investor-State system of rights and protections.\"131 Such a result also would be contrary to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, under which \"no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\" once the consent has been given previously by both parties.132\n\nTermination Response, p. 3.\n\nTermination Rejoinder, p. 2.\n\nTermination Response, p. 3.\n\n**IV. THE COMMISSION'S POSITION**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. Interpretation of the ECT**\n--------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Commission contends that from the date of Italy's ratification of the ECT, its \"offer for arbitration ... was only addressed to investors from Contracting Parties other than EU Member States.\"133 That is because the ECT \"created international obligations only between third countries and the *competent* subject of international law of the area of Union law,\" *i.e.*, \"either the Union (for areas of Union competence) or the EU Member States (for areas of Member State competence).\"134 This in turn is so because EU Member States \"can only enter into international obligations *inter se* to the extent that they have not transferred their external competence to the Union.\"135\n\nCommission Submission, p. 3, section heading 2.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 13.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 14.\n\n62.\n\nThe Commission accepts that Article 26 of the ECT is to be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT.136 It notes that Articles 1(2) and 1(3) allow a REIO to be a Contracting Party with respect to matters over which States have \"transferred competence ..., including the authority to take decisions binding on them,\" and contends that Article 36(7) further reflects \"the division of competences and foresees that the Union votes on matters falling in its competence, and the Member States on matters falling in their competence ....\"137 Moreover, Article 1(10)'s reference to the \"Area\" of a REIO crossreferences \"the agreement establishing that Organization,\" which in this case are \"the EU Treaties, i.e. the TEU, the TFFEU and the Euratom Treaty.\"138 In consequence, since the \"Area\" of the EU \"comprises the entirety of the areas of the EU Member States,\" an investment by an EU investor in Italy is \"not an investment in the area of another Contracting Party, but in the area of the same Contracting Party.\"139 Starting from this proposition that \"[t]he Union [is] a single investment area for its Member States,\" the Commission concludes that \"the offer for arbitration made by the Union (comprising, among others, Italy) is hence only made to investors from Contracting Parties that are not EU Member States.\"140\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Commission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\n63.\n\nThe Commission rejects the contrary notion, adopted by the *Charanne* and *RREEF* tribunals, that the term \"Area\" instead should be \"defined depending on who is the respondent.\"141 That view, which would remove any assessment of whether a Member State or the Union \"has the external competence for the matter in question,\" would deprive Article 1(10)'s reference to \"the agreement establishing that Organization\" of any effectiveness or *effet utile*.142 It also \"disregards the importance that the ECT places in Article 1(3) on the transfer of competence\" from individual States to the REIO.143 Finally, only the Commission's interpretation would avoid \"respondent shopping,\" under which investors could always avoid bringing claims against the EU itself simply by challenging the \"national acts of execution of Union law\" on which the Union generally relies in the absence of its own direct enforcement tools.144\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 28; Commission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\n64.\n\nThe Commission contends that its view of these provisions was clear from the outset, when it submitted a statement to the ECT Secretariat pursuant to ECT Article 26(3)(ii), referring to determinations \"if necessary\" between the EU and its Member States as to \"who is the respondent party to arbitration proceedings initiated by an Investor of *another Contracting Party*.\" The Commission contends that the word \"another\" in this context \"clearly excludes disputes brought by EU investors against a Member State,\" and thus illustrates the understanding from the beginning that only investors from non-EU States could bring a case against the EU or its Member States.145\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n65.\n\nThe Commission further argues that its interpretation is \"supported by the context, object and purpose of the ECT.\"146 First, EU law is a \"relevant rule of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, particularly as the ECT was initiated by the EU and incorporates by reference the Charter of Paris and the European Energy Charter, which refer to the EU's special role and status.147 As a matter of EU law, both the EU and its Member States are \"bound by the general principle of ... unity in the international representation of the Union,\"148 and accordingly they \"acted throughout the [ECT] negotiations like one single block.\"149 Indeed, the ECT was proposed by the Commission and initially conceived as a European treaty, to promote cooperation \"between the European Communities, on the one hand, and Russia, the CIS and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, on the other hand.\"150 This \"historical process\" confirms that the ECT was \"perceived as part of the European Communities' external energy policy\" and \"never intended ... [to] influence their internal energy policy,\" which was already \"well under way when the ECT was negotiated.\"151\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 32; Commission Update, \u00b6 22.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 36.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 39.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n\n66.\n\nIn the Commission's view, the absence of a \"disconnection clause\" in the ECT is of no significance, since such a clause is \"*only* needed where the application of Union law between the Member States is not in line with Article 41(1)(b) VCLT. Where, on the contrary, as in the present case, the rights and obligations of third countries are not affected, 'the insertion of the EU-specific 'disconnection clause' seems to be entirely superfluous'.\"152 Moreover, disconnection clauses have \"traditionally been used in international treaties where the Union could not become a Contracting Party itself,\" so \"disconnection clauses may indeed be useful, as ... a 'reminder of [the Union's] existence'.\"153 This is unnecessary in treaties like the ECT where the EU itself is a party and its role as a REIO is explicitly recognized.154\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 49 (citation omitted).\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 51.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 52.\n\n67.\n\nThe Commission acknowledges in its updated submission the fact that the EU nonetheless had attempted during the ECT negotiations to introduce a disconnection clause, but that clause in the end was removed from the relevant ministerial declaration.155 In its view, the *Vattenfall* tribunal was wrong to \"attach[] particular importance\" to this history,156 for two reasons. First, there was \"no legal need for a disconnection clause,\" which would have had \"purely declaratory, but no constitutive character.\" Second, the ECT's language on the REIO itself \"evolved over time in the negotiations, turning into a disconnection clause itself, because it recognizes the transfer of competences\" to the REIO and the fact that \"in such a situation, the relevant territory of the Contracting Party is that of the [REIO], and not that of its members.\"157\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 24.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 24 (citing *Vattenfall*, \u00b6 205 (**CL-193**)).\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 25.\n\n**B. EU Law Developments**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Progressive Development of EU Treaties**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission submits that Italy cannot be viewed as ever having made an offer of arbitration to investors of other EU Member States. However, even if *arguendo* Member States had entered into certain *inter se* obligations through the ECT, \"those obligations would only cover areas where EU Member States retain external competence.\"158\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 54.\n\n69.\n\nHowever, by virtue of the progressive development of the EU Treaties, EU law internal market rules now \"govern and protect all steps of the life-cycle of an investment,\"159 including through provisions on freedom of establishment and free movement of capital and payments, which forbid discriminatory measures and other restrictions on investment, and also govern expropriation.160 EU law also \"provides for a complete set of remedies that ensure its proper application.\"161 In consequence of these EU law rules on investment protection, EU Member States now lack the \"external competence\" to conclude an investment protection treaty between themselves, since this \"might affect common rules or alter their scope\" within the meaning of Article 3(2) TFEU.162 Only \"the Union has exclusive external competence to conclude agreements ... for areas where the EU Treaties expressly stipulate such exclusive competence.\"163\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 67.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 68-74.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 75.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 77.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64.\n\n70.\n\nThe Commission concludes that because \"all provisions in Part III and Article 26 ECT fall within the external competence of the Union,\" only the EU - and not its Member States - are bound by those provisions.164 Any opposite conclusion would place the ECT into conflict with Article 19(1) TEU and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU with respect to interpretation and application of EU law.165 That is because, pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, EU law is part of the \"applicable rules of international law\" to be applied by any arbitral tribunal, and under Article 26(8) of the ECT any arbitral decision should be \"final and binding.\" Yet, EU law does not permit the creation of dispute settlement systems to interpret EU law that are outside the \"complete system\" created by Article 19(1) TEU and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU.166\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 87.\n\nCommission Submission, Section 3.1.2 and \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 97.\n\n71.\n\nThe Commission urges the Tribunal to resolve any ambiguity with respect to intra-EU disputes through \"harmonious interpretation,\" in other words in a way that does not conflict with Union law.167 In the event of any \"open conflict\" between the ECT and the EU Treaties, however, the Commission considers that the EU Treaties \"take precedence over the ECT.\"168 The Commission rejects the notion that the ECT was intended to apply as *lex specialis* to EU law,169 and in particular the view (adopted by the *Vattenfall* tribunal) that Article 16 of the ECT \"qualifie[s] ... as a special conflict rule applicable to this conflict, to the detriment of the primacy of Union law.\"170 To the contrary, in its view, Article 16 of the ECT \"does not contain a rule of conflict, but only a rule of interpretation,\" and in any event any conflict rule reflected in ECT Article 16 \"would have been overruled by the later special conflict rule\" of the primacy of EU law within intra-EU relations, reflected in Article 351 TFEU and \"reaffirmed\" in the Lisbon Treaty.171 The Commission considers Article 351 TFEU to prevail even over the general conflict rules in Article 30 of the VCLT, since the latter \"were conceived as residual rules,\" whereas \"EU law foresees a special conflict rule\" involving the primacy of EU law.172 The Commission emphasizes that under Article 351 TFEU (formerly 307 EC), \"in matters governed by the EU Treaties, EU law takes precedence over international treaties concluded between Member States, regardless of whether they were concluded before or after EU accession.\"173 The Commission invokes the *Electrabel* decision in support of this argument.174\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 89, 91, 110 (2), \u00b6 116; Commission Update, \u00b6 8.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 91, 110(3), 113 (citing *Electrabel*, \u00b6\u00b6 4,178-4.191 (**RL-58**)); Commission Update, \u00b6 8.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 115.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 48.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 44.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 31.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 32 (citing CJEU case law).\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36.\n\n72.\n\nIn any event, the Commission argues, the same result would be obtained even if the Tribunal instead were to start with the general international law conflict rules contained in Articles 41(1)(b) and 30(4)(a) of the VCLT, rather than with EU law.175 First, since the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon \"re-affirmed\" the investment protection rules of EU law as well as general principles concerning competences and judicial protection, this \"could be interpreted as an amendment [of the ECT] pursuant to Article 41(1)(b) VCLT.\"176 Alternatively, since the Member States have \"reaffirmed their commitment to Union law\" by these three Treaties, the EU Treaties constitute the \"subsequent\" treaty for a *lex posterior* analysis under VCLT Article 30(4)(a).177 The result is that the ECT would apply only to the extent the EU Treaties did not relate to the same subject matter and their respective provisions were not incompatible.178 The Commission contends, however, that the ECT and the EU Treaties *do* relate to the same subject matter, since the ECT \"established a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the European Energy Charter,\" and the EU Treaties \"establish a European Union to achieve European unity, including an internal market that also covers energy,\" including a \"dedicated competence for energy\" introduced by the Lisbon Treaty \"for the first time.\"179 Moreover, the provisions of the ECT on investment protection (Chapter III) and dispute settlement (Article 26) are not compatible with EU law when applied between EU Member States. For this reason, the Commission concludes, \"they are, pursuant to Article 30(4)(a) VCLT, not applicable.\"180\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 118.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 127.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 132.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 128, 132.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 130; Commission Update, \u00b6 39.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 133. In the Commission's Update, it urges the Tribunal to consider \"same subject matter\" and \"incompatibility\" as a single condition rather than \"two separate conditions,\" contending based on the ILC drafting history of VCLT Article 30 that \"conflict is the necessary and sufficient condition,\" and that the rule \"applies to all situations where there is a conflict between the earlier and the later treaty.\" Commission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n\n**2. The** ***Achmea*** **Judgment**\n------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the *Achmea* Judgment is an \"authoritative and binding interpretation of the relevant provisions of Union law,\" not just for all EU Member States and any investor established in those States, but also for this Tribunal.181\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 2.\n\n74.\n\nThe Commission moreover interprets the *Achmea* Judgment as precluding intra-EU arbitration \"independently of the type of investment protection agreement it is based on (bilateral or plurilateral).\"182 It notes that the operative part of the judgment refers to \"*a* provision in *an* international agreement concluded between Member States ...,\" and further observes that \"all considerations set out in *Achmea* apply equally to intra-EU investment arbitration based on Article 26 ECT.\"183 That conclusion \"cannot be put into question\" by paragraph 57 of the *Achmea* Judgment, addressing agreements concluded by the Union, because the EU case law referenced in that paragraph addresses relationship with *non* -EU States, and the possibility of creating international courts under which the autonomy of the EU legal order will be respected, unlike the ECT where an intra-EU arbitral tribunal would have to apply EU law as part of the \"applicable rules and principles of international law.\"184\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 3.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 5.\n\n75.\n\nThe Commission notes that CJEU judgments \"apply, as a matter of principle, *ex tunc*, because the Court only interprets the law, and does not create new law.\"185 Although the CJEU in exceptional cases can limit the application of judgments in time, it has not done so in *Achmea*. Accordingly, \"there should be no doubt that the judgment in *Achmea* applies to all pending investment arbitration cases.\"186 In addition, \"when applied on an intra-EU basis, any grandfathering or sunset clause, such as Article 47(3) of the ECT, would be ineffective because it cannot extend the *ratione temporis* application of a treaty clause which is unlawful.\"187 The Commission rejects any concern, such as that expressed by the tribunal in *UP and CD Holding v. Hungary*, that an immediate application of the *Achmea* Judgment to pending cases would result in a retroactive withdrawal of consent in violation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.188 In its view, that concern \"overlooks the fundamental point that consent did not have to be withdrawn, because... no consent to arbitration in the concrete case had ever been validly given. The judgment in *Achmea* applies *ex tunc*.\"189\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 10.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 10.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 10.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 51 (citing *UP and CD Holdings v.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAlthough Italy's Termination Request filed earlier this year invokes most proximately the *Achmea* Judgment and the January 2019 Declaration, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to begin its analysis not with these recent EU law developments, but rather with the underlying issue of ECT interpretation on which both Parties, and the Commission itself, centered their jurisdictional submissions. This reflects the reality, not disputed in this case, that the source of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is in the international legal order, not the EU legal order. The Tribunal has been constituted as an international tribunal following Eskosol's presentation of an RFA under the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The Commission itself acknowledges that in these circumstances, \"[t]he starting point of your analysis is therefore necessarily one of international law.\"190 Italy likewise acknowledges that as an ECT signatory, it is \"bound by the obligations arising out of the ECT as established under international law,\" and therefore the specific question - whether it and other EU Member States \"bound themselves\" to intra-EU arbitration under the ECT - is equally one of international law, to be determined by use of traditional VCLT treaty interpretive tools.191\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\nBifurcation Request, \u00b6 165 and Section IV.A.A (\"Interpretation of the Contracting Parties' Intent Under Articles 31 and 32 VCLT\").\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore begins in the same place, with the goal of assessing whether - as of when the ECT entered into force for Italy and Belgium in 1998 - these States thereby reciprocally consented to arbitration of potential ECT claims by qualified investors of the other, notwithstanding their common membership in the EU. Following this analysis, the Tribunal examines the implications on Italy's consent of various subsequent developments in the EU legal order, including chronologically (a) the progressive development of the EU Treaties, (b) the *Achmea* Judgment, and (c) the January 2019 Declaration. This sequence mirrors the organizing principle the Tribunal used in the preceding Sections III and IV to summarize the positions of the Parties and of the Commission. The Tribunal finally addresses briefly the issue of enforcement, to which the Parties alluded in their submissions on jurisdiction.\n\n**A. INTERPRETATION OF THE ECT AS OF ITS ENTRY INTO FORCE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nAs a threshold matter, there is no dispute that both Italy and Belgium are Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, and accordingly under Article 25(1) of that Convention, jurisdiction \"shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between [Italy] and a national of [Belgium], which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"192 The relevant question for this Decision is whether Italy and Belgium so consented by virtue of their ratification of the ECT.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 25(1).\n\n79.\n\nIn resolving this question, the Parties broadly agree that the ECT should be interpreted by means of a traditional VCLT analysis, in particular according to the principles set forth in VCLT Articles 31 and 32. VCLT Articles 31 and 32 provide as follows:\n\nArticle 31  \nGeneral rule of interpretation\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\nArticle 32  \nSupplementary means of interpretation\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.193\n\nVCLT, Articles 31 and 32 (**CL-57**).\n\n80.\n\nIn conducting such a VCLT analysis, the Tribunal bears in mind several propositions. First, the ECT, like all other treaties, is to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the \"natural and ordinary meaning\" of its terms, in the context in which they occur. As the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") has explained, this means that \"[i]f the relevant words in their natural and ordinary meaning make sense in their context, that is the end of the matter,\"194 since the Contracting Parties' use of unambiguous terms should be taken as reflecting their clear intent. Second, the relevant \"context\" for construing any given passage in a treaty includes both the words and sentences found in close proximity to that passage, including definitional terms, and other provisions of the same treaty which help illuminate its object and purpose.195 Third, in accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT, only if the approach required by Article 31 leaves a meaning \"ambiguous or obscure,\" or leads to a result that is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable,\" may recourse be had to supplementary means of interpretation.196 The ICJ has explained that even in these circumstances, \"a decisive reason\" (such as unmistakable evidence of the State Parties' intentions from such supplementary materials) would be required \"[t]o warrant an interpretation other than that which ensues from the natural meanings of the words\" of a provision.197\n\n*Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State to the United Nations*, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1950, p. 8 (**CL-59**).\n\n*See generally* *Kilic Insaat Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v.

ECT Article 26(3), in the Context of ECT Articles 1(2), (3) and (10)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nIn this case, the obvious place to begin is with Article 26 of the ECT, which is the provision directly addressing the Contracting Parties' consent to arbitration of ECT disputes. Article 26 provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nSETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN AN INVESTOR AND A CONTRACTING PARTY\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes can not [sic] be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3)\n\n(a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n\u2026\n\n(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:\n\n(a) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes...; or\n\n\u2026\n\n(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.198\n\nECT, Article 26 (**C-1**).\n\n82.\n\nBeginning with the opening words of Article 26(1) (\"Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party\"), there is no question that both Italy and Belgium were Contracting Parties to the ECT at the times relevant to this dispute. The ECT entered into force for both States in 1998, and Belgium remains a Contracting Party.199 Italy by contrast made a formal notification of its withdrawal from the ECT on 31 December 2014. Article 47(2) of the ECT however provides that \"[a]ny such withdrawal shall take effect upon the expiry of one year after the date of receipt of the notification by the Depository ...,\"200 and according to the ECT Secretariat, Italy's withdrawal from the ECT took effect only on 1 January 2016.201 This was several weeks after Eskosol had filed its Request for Arbitration on 9 December 2015. Even had it not done so until later, the sunset provision in Article 47(3) of the ECT provides that \"[t]he provisions of this Treaty shall continue to apply to Investments made in the Area of a Contracting Party by Investors of other Contracting Parties ... as of the date when that Contracting Party's withdrawal from the Treaty takes effect for a period of 20 years from such date.\"202 Notably, Italy has never contested Eskosol's contention in its Memorial that based on these ECT provisions, \"Italy's withdrawal is of no consequence to the present dispute.\"203 To the contrary, Italy acknowledged in its Post-Hearing Brief that \"under the ECT a decision to withdraw[] takes effect after one year.\"204 Accordingly, the Tribunal takes it as agreed that Italy, like Belgium, meets the definition of an ECT \"Contracting Party\" for purposes of this case.\n\nFor purposes of this Decision, the Tribunal assumes *arguendo* that Eskosol qualifies under the ECT as an investor of Belgium by virtue of Blusun's 80% shareholding, notwithstanding Eskosol's eventual entry into liquidation proceedings in Italy. The Tribunal addressed that question preliminarily in its Decision on Italy's Rule 41(5) Request, and will address it further in its Final Award.\n\nECT Art. 47(2) (**C-1**).\n\nECT Secretariat, Members and Observers: Italy (**C-90**).\n\nECT Art. 47(3) (**C-1**).\n\nMemorial, n.8.\n\nItaly PHB, n. 34.\n\n83.\n\nArticles 26(2) and (3) then address the procedures for resolution of certain types of \"disputes.\" Under Article 26(2), subject to a three-month amicable settlement period, \"the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution\" through various mechanisms, one of which is as stated in Article 26(2)(c), namely \"in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\" The immediately following provision, Article 26(3)(a), in turn provides that \"[s]ubject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration.\" Here, three expressions are important: the reference again to \"*a dispute*,\" the words \"*unconditional consent*,\" and the words \"*subject only*.\" The natural and ordinary meaning of the word \"unconditional\" is \"without conditions.\" The words \"subject only\" indicate that there are certain exceptions to this unconditional consent, but these are a finite universe, consisting solely of the exceptions expressly referenced in Articles 26(3)(b) and (c), neither of which Italy or the Commission has invoked in this case. Accordingly, the plain text of Article 26(3)(a) provides that, *unless* this case does not qualify in the first place as a covered \"dispute\" within the meaning of Article 26(3), Italy - a Contracting Party - consents to submission of the matter to international arbitration, and does so without conditions, *i.e.*, unequivocally. Article 26(4)(a)(i) confirms that ICSID arbitration is one procedural option available at the investor's election.\n\n84.\n\nThe central question in interpreting Article 26(3) is thus the scope of the covered \"*disputes*,\" for which Italy has provided its \"unconditional\" consent, *inter alia*, to ICSID arbitration. That scope is described in Article 26(1), which refers to \"[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III....\" On its face, this provision would seem to apply here, because Eskosol presents a claim against Italy for alleged breach of several ECT Part III obligations, relating to its investments within the physical territory of Italy. According to Italy and the Commission, however, a deeper analysis is required of Article 26(1), including of the defined terms \"*Contracting Party*\" and \"*Area*\" that it incorporates, which properly should result in a conclusion that even from the moment of its entry into force, the ECT *never* reflected consent for arbitration of intra-EU disputes.\n\n85.\n\nBefore turning to these particular arguments, the Tribunal observes that nothing in the text of Article 26 itself suggests its scope was intended to be restricted to disputes involving either an investor or a Contracting Party outside the EU. The argument thus depends on reading the provision in the context of *other* provisions of the ECT, pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, to see if an intent to exclude intra-EU disputes fairly can be located there and imported back into Article 26, as a significant implied constraint on Article 26(3)(a)'s otherwise \"unconditional consent\" to arbitration.\n\n86.\n\nAccording to Italy and the Commission, such an exclusion is implicit both in the definitions of \"Contracting Party\" and \"Area,\" provided in ECT Articles 1(2) and 1(10), respectively. Article 1(2) confirms that a Contracting Party may be either an individual State or a REIO, which is defined in Article 1(3) as an organization to which various States have \"transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.\" Article 1(10) defines the \"Area\" of an individual State in terms of the physical \"territory under its sovereignty,\" and the \"Area\" of a REIO as the collective \"Areas of the member states of such Organization, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organization.\" Italy and the Commission suggest that by using these terms in Article 26, the ECT Contracting Parties demonstrated an intent *ab initio* to eliminate any possibility of an intra-EU claim, or at least any possibility of such a claim relating to a \"matter\" for which Member States had \"transferred competence\" to the EU. The Commission additionally frames this as an absence of geographic diversity, arguing in essence that an EU national's investment in Italy is not a foreign investment as such, *i.e.*, \"not an investment in the area of another Contracting Party, but in the area of the same Contracting Party.\"205\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\n87.\n\nThe principal difficulty with this argument is that nothing in the ECT so states. Beginning with Article 1(2), there is no doubt that this *expands* the universe of ECT Contracting Parties by enabling REIOs (and not just States) to ratify the treaty, but nothing in its language suggests a concomitant intent to *curtail* the obligations of States which choose to become Contracting Parties in their own right. As for Article 1(3), this does refer to States having \"transferred competence\" to a REIO \"over certain matters,\" and the word \"transfer\" in its natural and ordinary meaning is capable of denoting the conveyance of exclusive (and not simply concurrent) powers. The effect of such a reading would be that for the \"certain matters\" over which the transferee (the REIO) *gains* authority, the transferor (the States) concomitantly *cedes* all residual authority. This notion of a transfer of exclusive competence is consistent with Article 1(3)'s reference to the REIO thereby obtaining \"authority to take decisions *binding* on [the States] in respect of those matters.\"\n\n88.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that Article 1(3) alludes only in the abstract to \"certain matters\" where such an exclusive transfer may occur, without elucidation as to which matters those may be. In particular, nothing in this Article remotely suggests a shared understanding, as of the date the ECT entered into force, that either the entirety of Part III's substantive obligations, or the entirety of Part V's procedural obligations with respect to dispute settlement, were the contemplated subjects of such an exclusive transfer.206 If such a wholesale transfer of exclusive competence for major parts of the ECT, among a large group of the ECT's original Contracting Parties, already had been completed or was directly contemplated as of the ECT's entry into force, one would expect that this major development would have been expressly referenced somewhere.\n\n*See* *Vattenfall*, \u00b6 180 (**CL-193**) (\"The mere mention in Article 1(3) that EU Member States have 'transferred competence over certain matters' to the EU does not convey that there is no application of the provisions of the ECT between EU Member States\"); *Blusun*, \u00b6 281 (**RL-56**) (\"The mere fact that the EU is party to the ECT does not mean that the EU Member States did not have competence to enter into *inter se* obligations in the Treaty. Indeed, the ECT seems to contemplate that there would be overlapping competences,\" with \"nothing in Article 1, nor any other provision in the ECT, suggest[ing] that the EU Member States had then transferred exclusive competence for all matters of investment and dispute resolution to the EU.\").\n\n89.\n\nMoreover, the Commission itself acknowledges that as a matter of EU law, \"in theory, EU Member States have the international capacity to enter into *inter se* obligations when negotiating a multilateral agreement for those areas of the agreement for which they retain competence....\"207 The same point is recognized by prominent EU law scholars, for example Pieter Jan Kuijper, who notably summarized this in his account of the negotiations and conclusion of the WTO agreement:\n\nIt is clear as a matter of international law that a mixed Community agreement, concluded simultaneously between the Community, its Member States and third States, is in principle capable of creating rights and obligations between all the parties and hence also between the Member States *inter se.*208\n\nWhile the Commission insists that \"in practice\" this is never done,209 in fact it is the obvious conclusion from the fact that both the Member States and the EU separately became Contracting Parties to the ECT, with no declaration that in doing so, the Member States' competence was restricted only to obligations *vis-a-vis* third States and specifically to the exclusion of any *inter se* obligations whatsoever. It seems undisputed, as the *Blusun* tribunal observed, that \"[n]o limitation on the competence of the EU Member States was communicated at the time that the ECT was signed,\" leading to a conclusion that \"[t]he *inter se* obligations in the ECT are not somehow invalid or inapplicable because of an allocation of competence that the EC says can be inferred,\" without having been stated anywhere at all. The *Blusun* tribunal concluded that \"[t]he more likely explanation, consistent with the text of the ECT, is that, at the time the ECT was signed, the competence was a shared one.\"210\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 37; *see also id.*, \u00b6 46 (\"in theory a possibility\").\n\nPieter Jan Kuijper, \"The Conclusion and Implementation of the Uruguay Round Results by the European Community,\" (1995) 6, *European Journal of International Law,* issue 1, pp. 228-229 (attached as **Annex EC-3** to the Commission Submission).\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 37.\n\n*Blusun*, \u00b6 283 (**RL-56**).\n\n90.\n\nFor these reasons, Article 26's incorporation by reference of Article 1(2)'s definition of \"Contracting Party,\" which in turn incorporates Article 1(3)'s definition of REIO, does not support the reading proffered by Italy and the Commission. Nor do the definitions of \"Area\" provided in Article 1(10) meaningfully assist their case. The \"Area\" of a REIO is defined in terms of the \"Areas of the member states of such Organization,\" and their particular \"Areas\" in turn are defined in terms of the \"territory under [their] sovereignty.\" The natural and ordinary meaning of the word \"*territory*\" is a geographical one, which is different in kind from the subject-related word \"matters\" that is used in Article 1(3) to describe the possible transfer of \"competence\" from States to a REIO. Moreover, while the term \"territory\" is qualified in one respect (\"territory *under their sovereignty*\"), it is difficult to accept that the transfer of certain powers to a REIO renders the \"territory\" in which those powers may be exercised any less \"sovereign\" for the States involved. The notion of \"sovereignty\" is a profound concept in public international law, which is not coextensive with the notion of \"authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of [designated] matters,\" the description of \"competence\" used in Article 1(3) in the context of an REIO. Furthermore, the cross-reference in Article 1(10) to \"the provisions contained in the agreement establishing\" the REIO does not transform the meaning of the constituent \"Areas\" of the REIO's member states, rendering those Areas any less \"territory under [their] sovereignty.\" There is no suggestion in this phrase of an exclusionary intent, *i.e.,* that the \"Area\" of a particular State may cease to qualify as such once that \"Area\" also becomes part of the broader \"Areas\" relevant to a REIO.211 There is certainly no stated link between this provision and the subject of dispute settlement, suggesting a contemporaneous intent to restrict Article 26 consent for any Contracting Party that avails itself of a REIO procedure.\n\n*See* *Vattenfall*, \u00b6 181 (**CL-193**) (concluding that \"Within the EU's 'Area', the Contracting Parties being members of the REIO do not cease to have their own Area\"); *see also* *Eiser*, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196 (**CL-149**) (suggesting an additional \"difficulty with this analysis,\" namely that also implies \"an Investor loses its national character and becomes predominantly an Investor of the EU, because its home country is also an EU Member State and subject to EU law,\" but it is \"not evident how there can be an 'Investor of the EU' satisfying Article 1(7)(a)(ii)'s definition\" of investors, since \"[t]here is no trans-national body of European law regulating the organization of business units, a matter that remains subject to member countries' domestic law.\").\n\n91.\n\nAs several tribunals have now concluded, the ECT Contracting Parties could have explicitly referenced an intent (had they in fact so intended at the time) that the ECT as a whole be exclusively an outward-looking document, to regulate only the relations between EU Member States and third States, but not the rights and obligations of EU Member States to one another. Alternatively, the ECT Contracting Parties could have incorporated a narrower exclusion clause, limited specifically to the subject of dispute settlement. As the ILC has noted, the very function of a \"disconnection clause\" is that it \"seek[s] to replace a treaty in whole or in part with a different regime that should be [] applicable between certain parties only,\" with such clause \"agreed to by all the parties of the treaty.\"212\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 294 (**R-8**).\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *Eiser* tribunal that an express provision in the ECT addressing intra-EU disputes would have been the proper way for \"treaty makers... to carry out their function in good faith, and not try to lay traps for the unwary with hidden meanings and sweeping implied conclusions.\"213 The *RREEF* tribunal likewise considered an express warning, such as that contained in an \"unequivocal disconnection clause,\" to be required.214 It is notable that before the ECT entered into force the EU already had incorporated express disconnection clauses into other treaties, to ensure that the provisions of a mixed agreement would not apply as between EU Member States.215 This confirms the obvious, that it knew how to provide for these when it wished to do so. Indeed, as the *Vattenfall* tribunal observed, the EU in fact *had* proposed the insertion of a disconnection clause, but that clause ultimately was not included in the final treaty.216 The Commission's contention that this decision should be interpreted as confirmation that no such clause was needed after the REIO language was finalized is not supported by anything in the text of the ECT.217 There is no suggestion anywhere in the treaty, nor for that matter in any supplementary material submitted to this Tribunal, that the REIO language was intended to function as some form of implicit disconnection clause whose inclusion obviated the need for the explicit clause that the EU originally had sought to include.\n\n*Eiser*, \u00b6 186 (**CL-149**).\n\n*RREEF*, \u00b6\u00b6 84-85 (**CL-101**). *See also Blusun*, \u00b6 280(2) (**RL-56**) (\"*Prima facie* at least, a treaty applies equally between its parties. It would take an express provision or very clear understanding between the negotiating parties to achieve any other result.\").\n\n*See* *Vattenfall*, \u00b6 203 (**CL-193**).\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6 205 (**CL-193**); *see also Blusun*, \u00b6 280(4) (**RL-56**).\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 25.\n\n93.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the inclusion of REIOs within the definition of \"Contracting Party\" means no more for purposes of Article 26 than what the *Eiser* tribunal found, namely that \"[b]oth the EU and [its] Member States can have legal standing as respondents in a claim under the ECT.\"218 The same is true for the reference to \"Area\" in Article 26, as the *Charanne* and *Masdar* tribunals found.219 In particular, whether a particular \"dispute\" relates to a State or to the EU depends both on the *entity against whom* the claim is brought and on *the content of the claim*,220 in the sense of whether that claim in substance challenges a decision taken by State authorities or one emanating from the EU itself. In that regard, it is notable that the EU's 1998 statement submitted to the ECT Secretariat as part of its ratification process221 expressly affirmed that \"the European Communities and their Member States have both concluded the Energy Charter Treaty and are thus internationally responsible for the fulfilment of the obligations contained therein, in accordance with their respective competences.\"222 The document went on to explain, in this context of \"respective competences,\" that the EU and the relevant Member State would determine, if needed for a particular case initiated by an investor of \"another Contracting Party,\" which of them should go forward as \"the respondent party to arbitration proceedings\" to defend a challenge to a particular act.223 Nothing in this procedure to allocate the respondent's role, however, suggests a *jurisdictional* limitation preventing an EU investor from invoking the ECT's protections in the first place. In particular, the Tribunal agrees with the *Vattenfall* tribunal that \"[t]here is no basis to read a qualification that 'another' Contracting Party only includes non-EU Member States.\"224\n\n*Eiser*, \u00b6 94 (**CL-149**).\n\n*Charanne*, \u00b6\u00b6 427-431 (**CL-82**); *Masdar*, \u00b6\u00b6 318-323 (**RL-90**) (quoting with approval the conclusions of several prior tribunals).\n\n*Charanne*, \u00b6 431 (**CL-82**).\n\nPursuant to VCLT Article 31(2)(b), the \"context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text,...

Additional \"Context\" Provided by ECT Articles 16, 25, and 26(6)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nAside from its arguments based on Article 26's use of the defined terms \"Contracting Party\" and \"Area,\" Italy presents additional arguments based on the \"context\" supposedly provided by other ECT Articles.\n\n95.\n\nThe first of these is Article 25, which immediately precedes Article 26.225 The Tribunal however does not consider Article 25 relevant to the analysis. The provision states that the ECT \"shall not be so construed as to oblige a Contracting Party which is party to an Economic Integration Agreement... to extend, by means of most favoured nation treatment,\" any equivalent \"preferential treatment\" to other States that are not members of the same EIA. Italy points to a related Declaration by the EU and its Member States that nonetheless permitted certain third-State entities access to EU law protections, by virtue of registered offices or other substantial activities in EU territory.226 But these provisions fall far short of demonstrating a wholesale intent that the ECT's substantive protections and investment arbitration procedures not apply among EU Member States. If anything, Article 25 demonstrates that the EU had the ability, as part of the ECT drafting process, to incorporate provisions specific to its circumstances, in order to delineate precisely any desired limitations to the reach of particular ECT provisions, such as the MFN provision addressed in Article 25. As discussed above, there is no similar provision expressing any limitations on the reach of the investor-State dispute resolution mechanisms of Article 26.227\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 173-175.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 180-184.\n\n*See* *Eiser*, \u00b6 192 (**CL-149**); *Greentech*, \u00b6 215 (**CL-195**).\n\n96.\n\nNor does the governing law provision in ECT Article 26(6) demonstrate, as Italy suggests, that its \"offer to arbitrate investment disputes *has... always been inapplicable*... to intra-EU disputes,\" based on propositions of EU law that have been codified \"*from the very beginning*.\"228 As a threshold matter, a governing law clause would be a highly unusual place to signal an intent to exclude numerous Contracting Parties from the reach of express treaty provisions, including the treaty's dispute resolution mechanisms, based on an ostensible supposition that readers of the clause would understand the jurisdictional implications of any bodies of law thus incorporated. It would be particularly curious to use a governing law clause in this way, *without ever mentioning* the particular body of law said to result in such a sweeping carve-out from the otherwise clear meaning of the arbitral submission clause. In this case, Article 26(6) provides simply that \"[a] tribunal... shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\"\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92 (emphasis added).\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal will discuss this particular phrase further in Section V.B.1 and V.B.2 below, in the context of examining the potential implications for ECT cases of the progressive development of the EU Treaties and certain interpretations of those Treaties now authoritatively rendered by the CJEU in the *Achmea* Judgment. As developed further there, the Tribunal does not consider this phrase in Article 26(6) to be a broad *renvoi* to EU law as part of the ECT's own governing law, and particularly not for issues of jurisdiction. For present purposes, however, it is noteworthy that nothing in the phrase \"applicable rules and principles of international law\" signaled an intent *ab initio*, when the ECT entered into force in 1998 for the EU and its various Member States, that the provision thereby excluded any possible form of intra-EU arbitration. Had this proposition been such an obvious and unmistakable proposition of EU law as of 1998, one would have expected it to be referenced more explicitly somewhere in the treaty, or at least expressly in the preparatory works or the declarations submitted at the time, not simply left to future interpretations of a general provision on applicable law.229 In these circumstances, even if (*arguendo*) Article 26(6) of the ECT could be said to require some attention to EU law for purposes of interpreting the original intent of the ECT Contracting Parties at the time the ECT entered into force, \"no persuasive case has been made out for applying it so as to yield an interpretation of Article 26... that departs so radically from the ordinary meaning of the terms of that Article,\" as to exclude intra-EU disputes from the scope of Italy's consent to arbitration in that provision.230\n\n*See similarly* *Eiser*, \u00b6 198 (**CL-149**) (rejecting an \"argument [that] Article 26(6) seeks to introduce a major, if unwritten, exception into the coverage of the ECT on the back of a somewhat intricate argument regarding choice of law,\" absent any evidence that the ECT's drafters \"either intended or accomplished this result\").\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6 167 (**CL-193**).\n\n98.\n\nThe final ECT provision that Italy invokes, in support of its contention that even as of the date of its entry into force the ECT did not apply to intra-EU disputes, is the conflict rule reflected in Article 16. Article 16 provides as follows:\n\nRELATION TO OTHER AGREEMENTS\n\nWhere two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject-matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,\n\n(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and\n\n(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,\n\nwhere any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal will discuss in Section V.B.1 the implications of Article 16 with respect to the relationship between the ECT and *later* treaties, including the possibility that Article 16 may have been superseded by subsequent conflict rules established through the progressive development of the EU Treaties. For present purposes, it suffices to conclude that nothing in Article 16 remotely supports the contention that the ECT itself, as of its entry into force for Italy and Belgium in 1998, already excluded the possibility of claims by their respective investors by virtue of the requirements of the *then-existing* EU Treaties. First, Article 16 is a *general* conflict rule, making no specific reference to any particular treaty, and is thus different in kind from a *treaty-specific* conflict rule like the one the ECT incorporates for the Svalbard Treaty through its annexed Decision 1.231 It would be exceedingly odd for the negotiators of a new multilateral treaty to exclude its application as among a major block of intended Contracting Parties, not by means of an express provision like Decision 1 that addresses a specific instrument governing the relationship among those parties, but instead through a general provision regulating globally the new treaty's relationship with all other potential past and future treaties. As previous tribunals have found, this is hardly the obvious way to provide notice of an intended exclusion, particularly one of such potentially sweeping significance.232\n\n**C-1**, p. 227, Decision 1 (\"In the event of a conflict between the treaty concerning Spitsberger of 9 February 1920 (the Svalbard Treaty) and the Energy Charter Treaty, the treaty concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the conflict, without prejudice to the positions of the Contracting Parties in respect of the Svalbard Treaty. In the event of such conflict or a dispute as to whether there is such conflict or as to its extent, Article 16 and Part V of the Energy Charter Treaty shall not apply.\").\n\n*See, e.g., Masdar*, \u00b6 311 (**RL-90**) (quoting with approval the following text from *PV Investors v. Spain*, PCA Case No. 2012-14, Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 183 (13 October 2014): \"It would seem striking that the Contracting Parties made an express exception for the Svalbard Treaty, which concerns an archipelago in the Arctic, but somehow omitted to specify that the ECT's dispute settlement system did not apply in all of the EU member states' relations. Compared to the Svalbard Treaty Exception, an exception with regard to intra-EU relations would be of much greater significance. It would be extraordinary that an essential component of the Treaty, such as investor-State arbitration, would not apply among a significant number of Contracting Parties without the Treaty drafters addressing this exception.\"); *see also* *Eiser*, \u00b6 187 (**CL-149**) (noting that the ECT \"includes multiple limiting decisions and understandings,\" including the conflict rule about the Svalbard Treaty, but \"no similar clarifying provisions regarding what Respondent now contends is a major exclusion in the ECT's coverage\").\n\n100.\n\nSecond, and in any event, Article 16(2) provides the inverse of what Italy contends, by making clear that its provisions on dispute resolution were intended to apply *notwithstanding* any prior treaties among Contracting Parties with which it arguably might conflict. Thus, even in circumstances where the prior treaty might be found *arguendo* to \"concern the subject-matter of Part III or V of this Treaty\" - the predicate for the rest of Article 16 to apply at all233 - Article 16(2) confirms nonetheless that \"nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from *any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto* under this Treaty... where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\" This provision co-exists with Article 16(1), which provides similarly that \"nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement,\" again in circumstances \"where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\" Articles 16(1) and 16(2) are connected by an \"*and,*\" not an \"*or*,\" which in its natural and ordinary meaning indicates that they are to be read cumulatively, not in the alternative. As other tribunals have found, the plain reading of the two in conjunction is that an investor is entitled to the dispute resolution benefits of *whichever* of the ECT and a prior or posterior treaty is \"more favourable.\"234\n\nThe Tribunal addresses the same \"subject-matter\" issue later in this Decision, in the context of Italy and the Commission's arguments that the progressive development of the EU Treaties leads to an alternate conflict rule than Article 16, under VCLT Article 30(4)(a)'s regulation of incompatible provisions in successive treaties relating to the same subject matter. There is no need to discuss the issue in the context of Article 16 of the ECT itself, given Article 16(2)'s express \"saving\" of an ECT arbitration option even in circumstances where another treaty is found to relate to the same \"subject-matter.\"\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Eiser*, \u00b6 202 (**CL-149**) (\"To the extent that provisions of European law may in some manner provide protections more favorable to Investors or Investments than those under the ECT, Article 16(2) makes clear that they do not detract from or supersede other ECT provisions, in particular the right to dispute settlement under ECT Part V. By its terms, Article 16 assures Investors or their Investments the greatest protection available under either the ECT or the other agreement. Thus, an agreement covered by Article 16(2) may improve upon particular protections available to Investors or their Investments, but it cannot lessen rights or protections under the ECT that are in other respects more favorable.\").\n\n101.\n\nAs to that issue, Italy contends that \"EU law, as representing a more developed and articulated legal system, is doubtless more favorable to the investor and the investment than the ECT.\"235 Eskosol contends that EU law is not \"more protective\" than the ECT, \"in particular with regard to the right of investors to bring arbitral claims directly against Contracting Parties under the ECT.\"236 In the view of the Tribunal, there is no need to opine abstractly on the comparative \"favourability\" of these two bodies of law, since the obvious object and purpose of Article 16 is to expand rather than curtail investor protections in the circumstance of multiple applicable treaties. It is therefore entirely logical to read the provision as allowing *the investor itself* to make the choice, in any particular circumstance, as to which treaty's dispute resolution mechanism it prefers to invoke.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 212.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 73.\n\n102.\n\nThe bottom line is that the \"favourability\" of a particular mechanism, like the beauty of a particular person in the classic idiom, is very much \"in the eye of the beholder.\" Nothing in Article 16 suggests an intent for any particular body - be it the Contracting Parties, a REIO, an international arbitration tribunal, or otherwise - to make sweeping pronouncements at the level of theory about which dispute resolution mechanisms are \"more favourable\" than others, much less to have such pronouncements bind all future investors in all future cases, notwithstanding their own possibly different views of the comparative benefits and drawbacks of the various alternatives offered by the treaties in force. If a particular investor in its own wisdom prefers to invoke the ECT's arbitration mechanism rather than a different dispute resolution mechanism offered through a different treaty, *that choice alone* suggests the investor considers ECT arbitration to be \"more favourable\" in its particular circumstances.237 There is nothing in Article 16 which requires this choice to be overridden, in favor of a one-size-fits-all conclusion that a different forum might be \"more favourable\" to a different investor in other circumstances.\n\n*See generally* *Masdar*, \u00b6 332 (**RL-90**) (explaining that a Claimant availing itself of the provisions of Article 26 of the ECT, over alternative mechanisms available under EU law, evidently considers this \"more favourable, not least, because they obviate the need to bring the claim\" in the national courts of the host State); *Vattenfall*, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195 (**CL-193**) (concluding that \"Article 26 ECT, granting the possibility to pursue arbitration, would be understood as 'more favourable to the Investor', insofar as the EU Treaties are interpreted to prohibit that avenue of dispute resolution,\" and accordingly \"by the terms of Article 16 ECT itself, it would be prohibited for a Contracting Party to construe the EU Treaties so as to derogate from an Investor's right to dispute resolution under Article 26 ECT,\" even \"assuming for the sake of argument\" that provisions of the EU Treaties are understood to concern the same subject matter).\n\n**3. The ECT's History and Circumstances**\n------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe analysis puts to rest Italy's arguments regarding the non-applicability of the ECT by its own terms, either under Article 26 itself or in the context of other provisions. In these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no need to delve deeply into Italy and the Commission's additional arguments based on the historical circumstances of the ECT's conclusion, including references from its preparatory work to a goal of integrating the energy sectors of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.238 There is nothing \"ambiguous or obscure\" in the ECT that permits resort to supplementary materials under Article 32(a) of the VCLT.239 In any event, even if the historical materials were consulted and the proposition about integration accepted on face value, this still would not prove Italy's point, since an *intent to include* third parties in a network of relationships to be governed by common legal obligations does not necessarily denote a concomitant *intent to exclude* existing partners from the same network governed by the same legal obligations.240\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 186-189; Commission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 39-44.\n\n*See similarly* *Charanne*, \u00b6 437 (**CL-82**); *Eiser*, \u00b6 205 (**CL-149**); *Greentech*, \u00b6 213 (**CL-195**).\n\n*See* *Vattenfall*, \u00b6 200 (**CL-193**) (noting that \"the stated purpose of the ECT under Article 2 is framed generally, and without the geographical distinction argued by the EC. Moreover, even if the EC is correct that this was indeed one purpose behind the Treaty, it does not follow that the ECT was not intended to cover other kinds of investment\").\n\n104.\n\nIf anything, several aspects of the contemporaneous history suggest the contrary. First, as Advocate General Wathelet has observed, the ECT \"was concluded not as an agreement between the Union and its Member States, of the one part, and third countries, of the other part, but as an ordinary multilateral treaty in which all the Contracting Parties participate on an equal footing. In that sense, the material provisions for the protection of investments provided for in that Treaty and the ISDS mechanism also operate between Member States.\"241 Moreover, it is notable that \"no EU institution and no Member State sought an opinion from the Court on the compatibility of that treaty with the EU and FEU Treaties,\" presumably indicating that \"none of them had the slightest suspicion that it might be incompatible.\"242 While the Tribunal accepts that Advocate General Wathelet's Opinion is in no way binding as *an interpretation of EU law*, the observations above are nonetheless compelling as a recitation of *historical fact*, from which the Tribunal can draw its own conclusions regarding the contemporaneous understanding and intent of the ECT Contracting Parties.\n\nCase No. C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 Sep. 2017, \u00b6 43 (**RL-91**).\n\nCase No. C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 Sep. 2017, \u00b6 43 (**RL-91**).\n\n105.\n\nIt is equally useful to recall the legal basis on which the EU became a party to the ECT, which is set out in Council Decision 94/998/EC (as to signature) and Council and Commission Decision 98/181/EC, ECSC, Euratom (as to ratification).243 This last decision authorizing the ratification was approved by all the interested European institutions, and stated *inter alia* that the EU and Member States signed the ECT and the Energy Charter Protocol \"in order to provide a *secure and binding* international legal framework for the principles and objectives set out in that Charter,\" and that the EU considered it necessary for it \"*to participate fully in the implementation*\" of the ECT and the Energy Charter Protocol by becoming a Contracting Party itself.244 This reference to the EU's joining in order to \"participat[e] fully\" in the ECT's \"implementation\" in no way suggests an intent that any particular ECT provision - in this case, the core dispute settlement provision in Article 26 - would accordingly *not* be implemented with respect to the subset of ECT Contracting Parties who were also EU Member States. To the contrary, the language suggests that at the time the ECT was ratified, the European institutions considered the treaty, interpreted according to its natural and ordinary meaning, to be in perfect conformity with EU law.\n\nOJ 1994 L 380/1-2 and OJ 1998 69/1-3.\n\nCouncil and Commission Decision 98/181/EC, OJ 1998 69/1-3 (emphasis added).\n\n106.\n\nEqually important, and as clearly stated in *Electrabel*, is \"the important legal fact that the European Commission itself, in signing the ECT, accepted the possibility of international arbitrations under the ECT,\"245 notwithstanding the Commission's responsibility under EU law for ensuring that all such treaties negotiated \"are compatible with internal Union policies and rules.\"246 As the *Electrabel* tribunal reasoned, it can be presumed that the Commission did not at the time consider EU law to conflict or otherwise be inconsistent with the ECT:\n\nThe Tribunal notes the still more important fact that the European Union also accepted in signing the ECT to submit itself to international arbitration, thereby accepting the possibility of an arbitration between the European Union and private parties, whether nationals of EU or Non-EU Member States and whether held within or without the EU.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, if the European Union has itself accepted to submit to arbitration a dispute with a private investor concerning the application of the ECT (as it did), it cannot properly argue that such an arbitration is not similarly available to the same private investor advancing a claim under the ECT against an EU Member State, including an arbitration under the ICSID Convention.247\n\n*Electrabel*, \u00b6 4,158 (**RL-58**).\n\n*Electrabel*, \u00b6 4,135 (**RL-58**). The relevant EU rule at the time was contained in Article 133 EC (now Article 207(3) TFEU).\n\n*Electrabel*, \u00b6\u00b6 4,163, 4,164 (**RL-58**).\n\n107.\n\nFinally, neither Italy nor the Commission have pointed to any materials in the historical record that suggest a different objective and understanding at the time they ratified the ECT. As the *Eiser* tribunal noted, it is \"[o]f perhaps greater significance\" that \"there is no evidence showing that any such objective was shared by all EEC members, or was communicated to and accepted by the other parties to the treaty.\"248 In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that anything in the ECT's history and circumstances demonstrates a contemporaneous intent and agreement by Contracting Parties not to apply it to intra-EU disputes, particularly given the clear terms otherwise reflected in ECT Article 26.\n\n*Eiser*, \u00b6 206 (**CL-149**).\n\n**B. EU Law Developments**\n--------------------------\n\n108.\n\nItaly argues that even if the Tribunal does not accept its interpretations of the \"intention *ab initio* of the Contracting Parties\" to the ECT, certain developments in EU law - in particular, the progressive development of the EU Treaties, as now interpreted by the CJEU in the *Achmea* Judgment - require intra-EU disputes to be excluded from the ECT's scope.249\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 195.\n\n109.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribunal emphasizes that this Decision does not seek to interpret EU law as such, much less express any judgment regarding the correctness of particular interpretations rendered by others on matters of EU law. Rather, the focus for this Tribunal is the *relationship* between the EU Treaties and the ECT, as a matter of international law. The Tribunal addresses below the Parties' arguments about that relationship, starting with the later EU Treaties (Section V.B.1) and then turning to the *Achmea* Judgment (Section V.B.2).\n\n**1. Progressive Development of the EU Treaties**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nFirst, Italy argues that the progressive development of the EU Treaties, and in particular the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, requires intra-EU disputes to be excluded from the ECT's scope.250 Italy emphasizes that the Lisbon Treaty added direct foreign investment to the EU's common commercial policy, with the result that this area is now considered to be within the EU's exclusive competence as a matter of EU law.251 This is relevant to the REIO issue discussed above, based on the Commission's argument that even if EU Member States initially may have undertaken *inter se* obligations through the ECT, those obligations could only cover areas where EU Member States thereafter continue to \"retain external competence.\"252 Italy and the Commission contend that as a result of the Lisbon Treaty, however, EU Member States no longer have such competence for foreign direct investment, which is now part of the core sphere of matters for which EU law demands uniformity of rules and interpretations.253 This applies both to substantive obligations regarding investment, which are covered by EU law internal market rules, and to procedural remedies.254 With respect to the latter, the primacy of EU law over any national law is ensured through the CJEU preliminary ruling mechanism established by Article 267 TFEU,255 and pursuant to Article 344 TFEU, Member States cannot submit any dispute concerning interpretation or application of EU law to any forum (including arbitration) where the preliminary ruling procedure is inapplicable.256 Thus, Italy and the Commission contend, the consequence of the Lisbon Treaty is that only the EU *now* may conclude international agreements in this area of exclusive competence; EU Member States may not conclude agreements between themselves which \"might affect common rules or alter their scope.\"257 It follows as a matter of EU law, they suggest, that any *prior* consent to intra-EU arbitration, even if granted under an earlier treaty, no longer can be applicable.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 195.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 196, 235.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 54.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 200.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 67-75.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 225-228.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 258-260; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 61, 64.\n\n111.\n\nBoth Italy and the Commission recognize, however, that this Tribunal derives its powers from international law (the ICSID Convention and the ECT) rather than directly from EU law.258 They contend that the progressive development of the EU Treaties is nonetheless relevant, for two separate reasons, each with several subparts. *First*, they contend that *the ECT itself* must be interpreted with reference to EU law, either because (a) ECT Article 26(6) directly incorporates EU law as part of the law applicable to an intra-EU dispute, or (b) VCLT Article 31(3)(c) commands that treaty interpretation \"take[] into account... any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\"259*Second*, they contend that the EU Treaties are \"successive treaties\" to the ECT, within the meaning of VCLT Article 30(2) and/or Article 30(4)(a), or alternatively are \"[a]greements to modify\" the ECT within the meaning of VCLT Article 41(1). Whichever analytical path is followed, Italy and the Commission argue that it leads to the same result, namely nonapplicability of any prior consent to ECT arbitration by virtue of the subsequent Lisbon Treaty. The Tribunal addresses these issues below.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 197 (\"From an international point of view, the issue is whether this subsequent agreement [the Lisbon Treaty] among only some of the Contracting Parties of the ECT, is compatible with the previous (general) treaty (the ECT). The answer can be derived from Articles 30 and 41 of the VCLT, as codifying customary international law.\"); Commission Submission, \u00b6 7 (\"your Tribunal applies as its rules of procedure the ICSID Convention, another treaty of international law, which is not part of Union law. The starting point of your analysis is therefore necessarily one of international law.\").\n\nVCLT, Article 31(3)(c) (**CL-57**).\n\n**a. EU Treaties as Part of Applicable Law: ECT Article 26(6)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nFirst, as noted above, Italy and the Commission contend that the applicable law provision of the ECT itself requires application of the EU Treaties as progressively developed through the Lisbon Treaty, since Article 26(6) provides that \"[a] tribunal... shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\" In their view, this provision applies equally to matters of jurisdiction as merits, since jurisdiction is frequently an \"issue[] in dispute,\" the phrase used in Article 26(6). Moreover, according to their reading, this provision incorporates by reference *any* body of international law applicable as between particular ECT Contracting Parties, which would include EU law as derived from the EU Treaties in force for Belgium and Italy. Thus, since the EU Treaties are a part of international law as among these EU Member States, EU law must apply \"when a tribunal assesses the applicability of the arbitration agreement and of the ECT at large in intra-EU disputes.\"260 Essentially, the argument is that ECT Article 26(6) operates as a direct and broad *renvoi* to the EU Treaties, with the result that there is no need to look elsewhere for potential rules regulating the relationship between successive treaties.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 88-90; *see also* Commission Submission, \u00b6 97 (contending that pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, EU law is part of the \"applicable rules of international law\" to be applied by any arbitral tribunal).\n\n113.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Tribunal notes the *Vattenfall* tribunal's conclusion that Article 26(6) *in toto* \"applies only to the merits of a dispute between the Parties. It does not apply to issues or questions relating to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"261 The *Vattenfall* tribunal reached this conclusion on a construction of the opening words of Article 26(6), namely that \"[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide *the issues in dispute* in accordance with....\" In its view, the expression \"issues in dispute\" referred back to Article 26(1), which describes \"disputes\" under the ECT as those \"which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of [a Contracting Party] under Part III,\" *i.e.*, the part of the ECT that \"sets out the substantive standards of treatment and protection to which investments are entitled.\" Since Part III \"does not include the provisions on dispute settlement, which appear in Part V of the ECT,\" the *Vattenfall* tribunal concluded that Article 26(6)'s provision concerning the applicable law \"is not relevant to issues concerning the dispute settlement clause in Article 26 ECT.\"262 This Tribunal finds that reasoning persuasive. It also is consistent with the text of ECT Article 26(3)(a), which states that the Contracting Parties' \"unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration\" is *\"[s]ubject only* to subparagraphs (b) and (c)\" of Article 26(3),263 and by exclusion therefore not to any additional restrictions on jurisdiction potentially lurking in Article 26(6).\n\n*Vattenfall,* \u00b6 121 (**CL-193**); *see also* *Greentech*, \u00b6 218 (**CL-195**) (similarly concluding that \"Article 26(6) ECT applies to the merits of the case and not to jurisdiction\").\n\n*Vattenfall,* \u00b6\u00b6 114-116 (**CL-193**).\n\nECT, Article 26(3)(a) (**C-1**) (emphasis added).\n\n114.\n\nHowever, even if *arguendo* that were not the case - and therefore Article 26(6) were considered relevant to issues of jurisdiction as well as the merits - the Tribunal does not agree that the effect would be to incorporate EU law as part of the applicable law. This is based both on the \"natural and ordinary meaning\" of the terms in Article 26(6), and on the \"context\" of those terms in relation to other provisions of the ECT.\n\n115.\n\nFirst, focusing on the text of the provision, the Tribunal will analyze the specific phrase *\"applicable rules and principles of international law.\"* The Tribunal considers that, although EU law is undoubtedly international law, it is not general international law, but rather a special species of international law. The narrower question with which the Tribunal is faced here is whether EU law is encompassed in the expression \"rules and principles of international law.\"\n\n116.\n\nThe sources of international law are authoritatively listed in Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute as follows:\n\na. international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;\n\nb. international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;\n\nc. the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;\n\nd. subject to the provisions of Article 59 [of the ICJ Statute], judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.\n\n117.\n\nSimilar to the *Vattenfall* tribunal, this Tribunal has no doubt that the EU Treaties qualify as one type of international law, namely the one described in Article 38(1)(a) of the ICJ Statute as \"international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states.\"264 But that is not the operative question, since ECT Article 26(6) does not state that all other international treaties concluded as between the host State and the investor's home State are automatically incorporated into the applicable law of the ECT. Rather, Article 26(6) uses the particular phrase \"*applicable rules and principles of international law.*\" Textually, this phrase incorporates two different notions: (a) \"*principles* of international law,\" and (b) \"*rules*... of international law.\" These phrases have particular meanings in public international law.\n\n*Vattenfall,* \u00b6\u00b6 140-141, 145-146 (**CL-193**) (agreeing with the finding of the *Electrabel* tribunal that \"EU law is international law because it is rooted in international treaties\") (quoting *Electrabel*, \u00b6 4,120 (**RL-58**)).\n\n118.\n\nStarting with the former, the reference to \"principles of international law\" encompasses two types of principles: (i) principles accepted by \"international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law,\" referred to in Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute, and (ii) \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,\" referred to in Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute. The first of these two, general principles accepted as customary international law, has an unambiguously narrow scope, as described by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Lotus* case:\n\n... the Court considers that the words 'principles of international law', as ordinarily used, can only mean international law as it is *applied between all nations* belonging to the community of States.\n\n\u2026\n\n... it is impossible - except in pursuance of a definite stipulation - to construe the expression 'principles of international law' otherwise than as meaning the principles which are in force *between all independent nations*.265\n\nExamples of such universally applied principles are the norms of *jus cogens*, from which no derogation by treaty is possible under VCLT Article 53;266 the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda*, from which the entire international order flows;267 the principle of good faith;268 and other principles of interpretation of international law, reflected in the VCLT itself.\n\n*SS Lotus (France v Turkey)*, (1927) PCIJ Ser A No 10, pp. 16-17 (emphasis added).\n\n*See* VCLT Article 53, entitled \"*Treaties conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law ('jus cogens')* (providing that \"[a] treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized *by the international community of States as a whole* as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.\") (**CL-57**) (emphasis added).\n\n*See* ILC Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, 1966, p. 211 (Art. 23, Commentary, item 1) (\"*Pacta sunt servanda* - the rule that treaties are binding on the parties and must be performed in good faith - is the fundamental principle of the law of treaties\").\n\n*See* ILC Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, 1966, p. 211 (Art. 23, Commentary, item 1) (noting that the principle of good faith \"is enshrined in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations\"); *Border and Transborder Armed Actions (Nicaragua v. Honduras),* ICJ, Judgment on Jurisdiction, 20 December 1988, 1988 ICJ Rep. 69, \u00b6 94 (stating that \"[t]he principle of good faith is one of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations\").\n\n119.\n\nAs far as the \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\" are concerned, these are international principles stemming from the convergence of national legal orders. The ICJ explained this concept in *Barcelona Traction* as follows:\n\nIn turning now to the international legal aspects of the case, the Court must, as already indicated, start from the fact that the present case essentially involves factors derived from municipal law - the distinction and the community between the company and the shareholder - which the Parties however widely their interpretations may differ, each take as the point of departure of their reasoning. If the Court were to decide the case in disregard of the relevant institutions of municipal law it would, without justification, invite serious legal difficulties. It would lose touch with reality, for there are no corresponding institutions of international law to which the Court could resort. Thus the Court has, as indicated, not only to take cognizance of municipal law but also to refer to it. It is to *rules generally accepted by municipal legal systems* which recognize the limited company whose capital is represented by shares, and not to the municipal law of a particular State, that international law refers.269\n\nThe ICJ's reference in *Barcelona Traction* to \"rules generally accepted by municipal legal systems\" is a clear reference to what Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute referred to as the \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations,\" but with less historically fraught terminology (*i.e.*, eliding the reference to \"civilized\" nations). The ICJ's point was that just as customary international law principles can be created by the universal behavior of States considered to have ripened into law, such principles also may emanate from the convergence in their national laws of generally accepted principles.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain)*, ICJ, Judgment, 5 February 1970, [1970] ICJ 1, \u00b6 50.\n\n120.\n\nThese two accepted concepts, delineating the origins of *general principles* of international law, encompass the scope of the reference in ECT Article 26(6) to \"applicable... *principles* of international law.\" They are quite distinct from the far broader concept of incorporating by reference *all other treaties* between ECT Contracting Parties, on which Italy and the Commission's arguments about ECT Article 26(6) depend. The same is true with respect to the word \"rules\" in Article 26(6), in the context of the expression \"applicable *rules*... of international law.\" For this word, it is useful to refer to a Report of the International Law Association:\n\nSome commentators draw a distinction between \"principles\" and \"rules\". Their definitions vary, but the general idea is that principles operate at a higher level of generality than rules. So, for example, one might speak of the \"principle\" of the freedom of the high seas, but of the \"rule\" that submarines, in passing through the territorial sea, must navigate on the surface and show their flag. However, in ordinary (legal) usage *the two terms are often used interchangeably*....270\n\nIn other words, like \"principles of international law,\" the phrase \"rules of international law\" refers also to rules *applicable to all States*, *i.e.*, to general rules.\n\nInternational Law Association, Final Report of the Committee. Statement of principles applicable to the formation of general customary international law, London Conference 2000, pp. 10-11 (emphasis added).\n\n121.\n\nFor these reasons, the phrase \"rules and principles in international law\" cannot be interpreted as encompassing EU law, which is a regional and not a worldwide system of law. This was well understood by the *Eiser* tribunal, when it rejected the argument that \"the treaties creating the EEC and the EU [\u2026] constitute 'applicable rules and principles of international law' for purposes of Article 26(6).\"271 The *Vattenfall* tribunal likewise concluded that \"EU law does not constitute principles of international law which may be used to derive meaning from Article 26 ECT, since *it is not general law* applicable as such to the interpretation and application of the arbitration clause in another treaty such as the ECT.\"272 This Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to Article 26(6), based on the \"natural and ordinary meaning\" of its terms, as they are understood within the broader field of public international law.\n\n*Eiser*, \u00b6\u00b6 197-198 (**CL-149**) (stating that \"Respondent's argument from Article 26(6)... seeks to introduce a major, if unwritten, exception in to the coverage of the ECT on the back of a somewhat intricate argument regarding choice of law. The Tribunal does not agree that the drafters of the ECT either intended or accomplished this result.\").\n\n*Vattenfall,* \u00b6 133 (**CL-193**)\n\n122.\n\nThe same conclusion is reinforced, moreover, by a review of these terms \"in their context,\" pursuant to the interpretative principles of VCLT Article 31(1). Specifically, the ECT contains another article, Article 16, for the specific purpose of addressing (as its title reflects) the ECT's \"RELATION TO OTHER AGREEMENTS.\"273 If the effect of Article 26(6) were that other treaties between the relevant Contracting Parties were directly incorporated into the ECT as applicable law - and indeed, in such a way as to override any contrary reading of other provisions of the ECT, which is what Italy and the Commission suggest as the necessary outcome of their Article 26(6) argument - then there would be *no* reason to have a specific article, Article 16, to regulate the impact of potentially overlapping treaties. By definition, there would be nothing to regulate, by the simple fact that other treaties already had been interpolated into the ECT by virtue of Article 26(6). In other words, the natural effect of an overbroad reading of Article 26(6) would be to render Article 16 superfluous. This would run counter to the accepted notion of *effet utile*, namely that the words of a treaty should be interpreted so as not to deprive them of all independent meaning and effect. The requirement to give Article 16 independent purpose reinforces and confirms the Tribunal's interpretation of the natural and ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 26(6).\n\nECT, Article 16 (title) (**C-1**).\n\n123.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal's conclusion that EU law is not part of the ECT's applicable law, and particularly not for determining the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT, does not mean that an ECT tribunal could not consider EU law as a *matter of fact* if potentially relevant to the merits of a dispute, just as an ECT tribunal may consider a State's domestic law as part of the factual matrix of a case. For example, while the Tribunal does not consider this case to involve a challenge to any acts that Italy was required to take under applicable EU directives, nor to involve a defense by Italy that it was required by EU law to take the challenged acts, in theory both types of arguments could be presented in an ECT case. In such situations, an ECT tribunal would be entitled to take into account, as did the *Electrabel* tribunal in its analysis of such issues, whether the respondent State had any legal discretion to act otherwise in accordance with its other international obligations.274 The absence of any such discretion could be a relevant factor in applying certain of the ECT's substantive standards in Part III, to the extent for example they incorporate restrictions on arbitrary or irrational conduct. Considering EU law to that extent, as a fact relevant to the application of international law standards, would be perfectly consistent with the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 26(6). It also for that matter would be consistent with the CJEU's interpretation of EU law in its Opinion in the *Commission v. Ireland* case, under which \"it is not sufficient, in order to establish a breach of Article 344 TFEU, that an arbitration tribunal takes account of EU law as a criterion for interpreting a provision *not forming part of EU law*. There could be an infringement of Article 344 TFEU only if the subject-matter of the decision of the arbitration tribunal were the interpretation and application of provisions of EU law themselves.\"275\n\n*See* *Electrabel,* \u00b6\u00b6 6.70, 6.72 (**RL-58**) (concluding that \"[i]n the Tribunal's view, that Final Decision required Hungary under EU law to terminate Dunamenti's PPA,\" and \"[w]here Hungary is required to act in compliance with a legally binding decision of an EU institution, recognized as such under the ECT, it cannot (by itself) entail international responsibility for Hungary. Under international law, Hungary can be responsible only for its own wrongful acts. The Tribunal considers that it would be absurd if Hungary could be liable under the ECT for doing precisely that which it was ordered to do by a supranational authority whose decisions the ECT itself recognises as legally binding on Hungary.\").\n\nOpinion of the Council Legal Service of 22 June 2007 (emphasis added).\n\n**b. EU Treaties in Interpreting the ECT: VCLT Article 31(3)(c)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe second basis on which Italy and the Commission contend that the ECT itself must be interpreted with reference to the later EU Treaties, including the Lisbon Treaty, is the statement in VCLT Article 31(3)(c) that interpretation of a treaty \"take[] into account, together with the context... any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\"276 As the Commission frames the argument:\n\nWhen both the Union and EU Member States become parties to a multilateral agreement, it is the Union legal order that informs the latter's behavior and actions. The Union legal order therefore constitutes a \"*relevant rule of international law applicable in the relations between the parties*\" in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.277\n\nVCLT, Article 31(3)(c) (**CL-57**).\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n125.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this argument requires little discussion. The critical phrase in VCLT Article 31(3)(c) is \"*between the parties*,\" meaning all parties to the treaty in question. It is hardly an exceptional proposition that where all parties to a given treaty have agreed to a particular \"rule[] of international law,\" then that rule may inform an understanding of their mutual intent in agreeing to particular treaty text. However, the ECT is not a treaty exclusively among EU Member States, but rather a much broader multilateral treaty that includes non-EU Member States. This prevents the application of EU law for the interpretation of specific provisions within the ECT. The text of a multilateral treaty must have a consistent and objective meaning, not different meanings determined separately and subjectively for each different subset of States that may be involved in a particular future dispute. As the *Vattenfall* tribunal cogently observed in rejecting a similar argument:\n\nThe EC's approach is unacceptable as it would potentially allow for different interpretations of the same ECT treaty provision. The Tribunal considers that this would be an incoherent and anomalous result and inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ECT and with the rules of international law on treaty interpretation and application....\n\nWhen States enter into international legal obligations under a multilateral treaty, *pacta sunt servanda* and good faith require that the terms of that treaty have a single consistent meaning. States parties to a multilateral treaty are entitled to assume that the treaty means what it says, and that all States parties will be bound by the same terms. It cannot be the case that the same words in the same treaty provision have a different meaning depending on the independent legal obligations entered into by one State or another, and depending on the parties to a particular dispute.278\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6\u00b6 155-156 (**CL-193**).\n\n126.\n\nMoreover, VCLT Article 31(3)(c) addresses what should be \"taken into account, together with the context\" of particular terms of a treaty. This provision itself must be viewed in the context of the core preceding proposition in Article 31(1), that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of a treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"279 This Tribunal agrees with the *Vattenfall* tribunal that Article 31(1), and not Article 31(3)(c), is the \"correct starting point for the interpretation of Article 26 ECT,\" and also that \"[t]he need for coherence, and for a single unified interpretation of each treaty provision, is reflected in the priority given to the text of the treaty itself over other contextual elements under Article 31 VCLT.\"280 In these circumstances, \"[i]t is not the proper role of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT to rewrite the treaty being interpreted, or to substitute a plain reading of a treaty provision with other rules of international law, external to the treaty being interpreted, which would contradict the ordinary meaning of its terms.\"281 And yet this would be the natural result of the Commission's arguments, by overriding as between some ECT Contracting Parties, but not others, the \"unconditional consent\" to international arbitration clearly reflected in ECT Article 26(3). The Tribunal rejects the notion that VCLT Article 31(3)(c) can be used in this way.\n\nVCLT, Articles 31(1), (3) (**CL-57**).\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6\u00b6 153, 156 (**CL-193**).\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6 154 (**CL-193**).\n\n**c. EU Treaties as \"Successive Treaties\": VCLT Article 30(2)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal is unable to accept the notion that the ECT *itself* requires a *renvoi* to the Lisbon Treaty for purposes of determining jurisdiction in intra-EU disputes, either by virtue of ECT Article 26(6) or by operation of the interpretative principle in VCLT Article 31(3)(c). If the Lisbon Treaty is to be relevant at all for jurisdictional purposes, it would have to be because of some *alternate rule* of international law regulating the relationship between multiple treaties concluded between the same sovereign States. The Tribunal turns below to the three provisions of the VCLT - specifically, VCLT Articles 30(2), 30(4)(a) and 41(1) - that Italy and the Commission have invoked in the alternative, to support their argument that the Lisbon Treaty must be deemed to override any consent to intra-EU arbitration that EU Member States earlier provided through the ECT.\n\n128.\n\nFirst, Italy invokes VCLT Article 30(2), which provides (together with Article 30(1)) as follows:\n\n*Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter*\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of State Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail....282\n\nVCLT, Articles 30(1), (2) (**CL-57**).\n\n129.\n\nItaly contends that the ECT Article 16 itself requires deference to subsequent treaties, in the same fashion as VCLT Article 30(2) does with respect to \"successive treaties.\" In particular, Italy invokes Article 16(1), stating in relevant part that where the terms of a subsequent treaty \"concern the subjectmatter\" of Part III or V of the ECT, \"nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement... where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.\"283 Italy argues, in essence, that this is functionally equivalent to Article 30(2)'s statement that the ECT is \"subject to\" the Lisbon Treaty, since the provisions of the ECT cannot be construed to derogate from the terms of the Lisbon Treaty.284\n\nECT, Article 16(1) (**C-1**).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 211-213.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with this interpretation. A statement that a particular treaty is \"subject to\" another treaty is clearly a declaration of priority as between the two, in the event of any conflict. The natural and ordinary meaning of \"subject to\" connotes a giving way by the subordinate treaty, in the face of the other dominant treaty. It is only logical that where a treaty so provides, the will of the Contracting Parties should be respected, with the result (in the language of VCLT Article 30(2)) that \"the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\" This is not, however, what ECT Article 16 says. Nowhere in its text does it indicate that the ECT is \"subject to,\" and accordingly always subordinate to, any other treaty, whether prior or subsequent. To the contrary, as already discussed, Articles 16(1) and 16(2) read together clearly provide that where the ECT and another treaty concern \"the same subject-matter,\" *neither* treaty is absolutely dominant over the other. Rather, under Article 16(1), where the other treaty is \"more favourable to the Investor or Investment,\" the investor may invoke its benefits, notwithstanding anything in the ECT, and under Article 16(2), where the ECT is considered \"more favourable,\" the investor in turn may invoke its benefits, notwithstanding anything in the other treaty. Given the inherently subjective nature of \"favourability,\" as also discussed above, the decision about which path to pursue is logically left to the investor. There is no suggestion in Article 16 of a process by which some higher authority must first weigh the abstract \"favourability\" of the two regimes, and then impose its comparative valuation on the investor. In this light, the evident object and purpose of the provision, emanating from the natural and ordinary meaning of its terms, is to provide the investor with a choice between two possible avenues, not to preclude one or the other.\n\n131.\n\nECT Article 16 is thus the *very opposite* of the type of treaty provision addressed in Article 30(2) of the VCLT, namely a clause that *removes ex ante* any choice as between two possible treaty regimes, by expressly stating that one is intended to be \"subject to\" the other. The negotiators of the ECT could have chosen to include such a clause, but they did not do so, except in a declaration specific to the Svalbard Treaty, as discussed above.285 In these circumstances, VCLT Article 30(2) is simply not applicable to provide a rule of priority as between the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty, *even if* those two treaties were considered to \"relat[e] to the same subject matter,\" which is the threshold condition specified in VCLT Article 30(1).\n\nECT, p. 227, Decision 1 (\"In the event of a conflict between the [Svalbard Treaty]... and the Energy Charter Treaty, the treaty concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the conflict.... In the event of such conflict or a dispute as to whether there is such conflict or as to its extent, Article 16 and Part V of the Energy Charter Treaty shall not apply.\") (**C-1**).\n\n**d. EU Treaties as \"Successive Treaties\": VCLT Article 30(4)(a)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts, of course, that while ECT Article 16 purports to regulate its relationship with subsequent treaties, that treaty provision, like any other, is capable in principle of being superseded by a later agreement which provides an alternate rule of priority. The Tribunal therefore turns next to the *lex posterior* arguments Italy and the Commission present under VCLT Article 30(4)(a). Under their theory, the \"primacy of EU law\" principle that was reaffirmed in the Lisbon Treaty operates as a \"later special conflict rule\" that overrules any conflict rule reflected in ECT Article 16.286 Specifically, the Commission argues that under Article 351 TFEU (formerly Article 307 EC), \"in matters governed by the EU Treaties, EU law takes precedence over international treaties concluded between Member States, regardless of whether they were concluded before or after EU accession.\"287\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 44.\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 32.\n\n133.\n\nArticle 30 provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n*Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter*\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of State Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2...\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\n\n4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:\n\n(a) as between State Parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3; \u2026.288\n\nVCLT, Articles 30(1), (3), 4(a) (**CL-57**).\n\n134.\n\nThere is a threshold question, of course, as to whether the EU Treaties should be considered the \"later treaty\" for purposes of any Article 30(4) analysis. Eskosol contends not, on the basis that \"Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have existed in the same form prior to the ECT,\"289 whereas the Commission considers that the EU Treaties do constitute the \"subsequent\" treaty, on the basis that the EU Member States \"reaffirmed\" these principles in the Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon Treaties that postdate the ECT.290 Italy also emphasizes that the Lisbon Treaty did introduce at least one relevant further change, in the sense of extending the common commercial policy to include foreign direct investment.291 For present purposes, the Tribunal assumes *arguendo* that the principles included in the Lisbon Treaty can be said to postdate the ECT at least with respect to foreign direct investment, even if many of these principles were drawn from the much earlier founding treaties of the European legal order.\n\nEskosol PHB, \u00b6 88(iii).\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 132.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 200, 235.\n\n135.\n\nThe second threshold question raised by the Parties' submissions is whether VCLT Article 30 contains two distinct conditions for application of the *lex posterior* principle, or just one. Textually, the provision refers to two conditions: (a) that the \"successive treaties relat[e] to the same subject matter,\" a phrase that is referenced both in Article 30's title and in Article 30(1), and (b) that the \"provisions\" of the two treaties are not \"compatible,\" which is referenced in Article 30(3) and made applicable in this particular context by Article 30(4). Nonetheless, the Commission urges the Tribunal to consider \"same subject matter\" and \"incompatibility\" as a single condition rather than \"two separate conditions,\" with the former essentially collapsing into the latter. In its view, \"conflict is the necessary and sufficient condition,\" and the *lex posterior* rule \"applies to all situations where there is a conflict between the earlier and the later treaty.\"292\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees. First, adopting the Commission's interpretation would effectively require rewriting the text, to ignore a threshold provision (\"the rights and obligations of State Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject matter\") which is expressly stated to be the foundational requirement for any of the following provisions of Article 30 even to apply (\"shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs...\"). Adherence to the natural and ordinary meaning of the terms does not permit the requirements of Article 30(1) to be skipped over, allowing direct recourse to Article 30(3).\n\n137.\n\nIt is notable, moreover, that the *comparators* in Articles 30(1) and 30(3) are different: Article 30(1) examines the relationship between *treaties as a whole* (whether they \"relat[e] to the same subject matter\"), while Article 30(3) examines the relationship between *particular provisions* within such related treaties (whether they are \"compatible\"). While in principle it could be possible to reason from the whole to a part (*i.e.,* that if two treaties at their macro-level *do* relate to the same subject matter, their particular provisions may well contain overlaps which require scrutiny for compatibility), it is not equally possible to reason in reverse, from a part to a whole (*i.e.,* that treaties necessarily relate to the same subject matter because specific provisions in different treaties might have different effects). The Commission's argument thus fails at the level of logic, in light of the different comparators set out in Article 30's plain text.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, the Commission has offered only limited jurisprudential support for its interpretation that VCLT Article 30 reflects a single test rather than two cumulative tests. It relies largely on a construction of the ILC's drafting history of VCLT Article 30, in which a prior version did not contain the phrase \"relating to the same subject matter,\" but the ILC final draft inserted this concept. The Commission cites the following explanation in the commentary:\n\nThe rules set out in the text of this article provisionally adopted in 1964 were formulated in terms of the priority of application of treaties having incompatible provisions. On re-examining the article at the present session the Commission felt that, although the rules may have particular importance in cases of incompatibility, they should be stated more generally in term of the application of successive treaties to the same subject-matter. One advantage of this formulation of the rules, it thought, would be that it would avoid any risk of [the provision] being interpreted as sanctioning the conclusion of a treaty incompatible with obligations undertaken towards another State under another treaty. Consequently, while the substance of the article remains the same as in the 1964 text, its wording has been revised in the manner indicated.293\n\nCommission Update, \u00b6 40 (quoting **Annex EC-49** at p. 232).\n\n139.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, however, even if recourse to such supplementary materials were appropriate under VCLT Article 32, this commentary cannot be read to suggest that the \"same subject matter\" proviso added to the final text should be treated as merely superfluous and given no meaning whatsoever. This is particularly the case given the difference in comparators discussed above, namely that the phrase relates to the \"subject matter\" of the treaties as such and not simply the compatibility of particular provisions.\n\n140.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal interprets Article 30(4) of the VCLT consistent with the ordinary and natural meaning of its terms, which apply the *lex posterior* principle only where (a) there are \"successive treaties relating to the same subject matter,\" and (b) there exists an incompatibility between certain provisions of the two related treaties. In this case, as discussed further below, there is no need to reach the second question (compatibility as a matter of international law), because in the Tribunal's view, the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty as a whole do *not* relate to the same subject matter.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that VCLT Article 30(1) does not define what it means for two treaties to be \"successive treaties relating to the same subject matter.\" Nonetheless, content must be given to these terms. The first observation is that a treaty is not \"successive\" to *all* treaties that came before it, simply because it is later in time; to \"succeed\" a prior treaty implies *some intended relationship* between the two, such that an inference may be drawn from the sequence regarding the Contracting Parties' intent for provisions of the latter to supplant those of the former. Otherwise, the *lex posterior* notion would be fatally broad, inconsistent with the right of States to enter into various different treaties for different purposes, without the earlier ones being negated each time a later one entered into force. The \"same subject matter\" test provides the description of the *type of relationship* that must be established between distinct treaties, before any inferences regarding intent may be drawn based on temporal considerations. This test accordingly must be given some positive meaning.\n\n142.\n\nFor this purpose, Italy itself suggests the Tribunal have recourse to the ILC's 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, which examined the challenge of defining a treaty's \"subject matter\" for purposes of determining when various conflict rules (*lex specialis*, *lex posterior*, etc.) may be applied.294 The ILC Report is indeed an important document, but its analysis does not necessarily support the result Italy suggests. It is true that the ILC expressed concern that if *too narrow* a test for subject matter were adopted, based simply on \"informal labels\" or characterizations, then the regulation of potential conflicts between treaties might be \"dependent on argumentative success in pigeon-holing legal instruments,\" including through the assignment of \"arbitrary labels on forms of professional specialization\" such as trade law, human rights law, or environmental law.295 At the same time, if *too broad* a test for \"subject matter\" were adopted, such that many quite different treaties could be swept into the same subject matter bucket, then arguably there would be no place any more for application of the important principle of *lex specialis* ; the principle of *lex posterior* would supply an automatic rule of priority merely as a function of chronology, without allowing any deeper examination of the underlying scope and purposes of the various instruments. The ILC noted that the *lex specialis* principle would thus have \"an unclear relationship to other maxims of interpretation or conflict-solution techniques, such as, for instance, the principle... [that] later law overrides prior law....\"296 Yet, *lex specialis* is \"widely accepted\" as having an independent role to play, since \"[a] special rule is more to the point... than a general one and it regulates the matter more effectively... than general rules.\"297 At the same time, *lex specialis* itself \"can only apply where both the specific and general provisions concerned deal with the same substantive matter\"; indeed, the ILC's own Draft Articles on State Responsibility limit the *lex specialis* principle to the context of treaties involving the \"same subject-matter.\"298 This again suggests the need for the \"same subject matter\" construct to be given independent meaning, ideally one that is neither too narrow nor too broad.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 207.\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 254 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 58 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 60 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 116 (citing Article 55 of the Draft articles on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts) (**R-8**). That Article, entitled \"*Lex specialis*,\" states that \"[t]hese articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law.\" The Commentary explains that \"[f]or the *lex specialis* principle to apply it is not enough that the same subject matter is dealt with by two provisions; there must be some actual inconsistency between them, or else a discernable intention that one provision is to exclude the other.\" **CL-143**, Article 55 and Commentary \u00b6 4.\n\n143.\n\nImportantly, in the ILC's view, \"the question of the relationship between two treaties cannot be resolved completely in abstraction from any institutional relationship between them.\" The ILC suggests the possibility of looking for \"an institutional connection between 'chains' or clusters of treaties that are linked institutionally and that States parties envisage as part of the same concerted effort.\"299 The ILC further explained that \"the notion of a 'regime' points to the institutional arrangements that may have been established to link sets of treaties to each other,\" which then allows more reasonable inferences regarding the intent of the States parties in regulating potential overlaps or conflicts as among those treaties.300 In particular, the ILC explained, the identification of such \"treaty regimes\" aids in application of principles of *lex posterior* or *lex specialis*, since \"the argument from [such principles] seems clearly more powerful between treaties within a regime than between treaties in different regimes.\"301 Thus, while *lex posterior* may be logically applied to successive treaties *within* a given regime, as across different regimes \"a straightforward priority of one treaty over another (that is in fact, of one regime over another) cannot be reasonably assumed on a merely chronological basis.\"302 To the contrary, the ILC emphasizes that where different treaties are *not* part of the same regime - that is, they are not \"institutionally linked and intended to realize parallel objectives\" - then \"[t]hose are also situations where the *lex posterior* rule has least application. In such situations, emphasis should be on guaranteeing the rights set up in the relevant conventions.\"303\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 255 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 256 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 255 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 272 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 323 (**R-8**).\n\n144.\n\nFor purposes of the present debate, the Tribunal considers this notion of \"treaty regimes,\" involving \"'clusters' of treaties that are linked institutionally and that States parties envisage as part of the same concerted effort,\" to be a useful way of considering the VCLT Article 30(1) inquiry into whether the ECT and the Lisbon Treaty are \"successive treaties relating to the same subject matter.\" Under this approach, the Lisbon Treaty certainly would qualify as such with respect to the prior EU Treaties, since all such treaties were adopted through the same institutional processes and were envisaged by the EU as part of a single concerted effort, to regulate the EU internal market by reference to EU law. By contrast, while Italy and the Commission argue that the ECT likewise was an \"effort[] of integration,\"304 in the sense that it \"establish[ed] a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field,\"305 this integration goal is insufficient on its own to qualify the ECT and the EU Treaties as having the same \"subject matter\" from the standpoint of international law. Numerous treaties pursue efforts of integration, as part of a general purpose of international law of bringing diverse States into greater legal and policy alignment through the adoption of common norms and procedures. Yet, the reality remains that the ECT was a quite different instrument from the EU Treaties, adopted on a multilateral level and for certain distinct purposes.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 208-209.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 130; Commission Update, \u00b6 39.\n\n145.\n\nThus, as the ECT's Preamble reflects, its many signatories not only \"undertook to pursue the objectives and principles\" of an EU document, the European Energy Charter, but also to \"broaden their cooperation\" multilaterally in support of various specifically stated goals, including *inter alia* \"the effective implementation of full national treatment and most favoured nation treatment,\" the \"progressive liberalization of international trade and... avoidance of discrimination in international trade\" in the energy sector, and more generally encouraging steps towards \"the most efficient exploration, production, conversion, storage, transport, distribution and use of energy.\"306 In support of these objectives, the ECT signatories agreed to detailed rules for \"Investment Promotion and Protection\" set out in Part III, and to equally detailed rules for \"Dispute Settlement\" set out in Part V, to apply on a broad multilateral basis. The objective of Part III of the ECT evidently was to provide for specific guarantees, defined in terms of international law rather than domestic law principles, in order to encourage international flows of investment into the energy sectors of at least certain ECT Contracting Parties. The objective of Part V in turn was to provide specific mechanisms, again at an international level and removed from domestic law, for resolving disputes about whether the Part III guarantees had been observed. This was no doubt a \"concerted effort,\" to use the ILC's terminology, but it is not one that can be considered part of the same \"treaty regime\" or \"cluster\" of treaties as the various EU Treaties. For this reason, the later EU Treaties (such as the Lisbon Treaty) do not qualify as a \"successive treaty related to the same subject matter\" as the ECT.\n\nECT, Preamble (**C-1**).\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal thus arrives at the same place as several prior tribunals, even if it adopts Italy's suggestion to examine the \"same subject matter\" issue by way of the ILC's 2006 Report on Fragmentation. For example, similarly to the analysis of VCLT Article 59 by the *EURAM v. Slovak Republic* tribunal, the Tribunal considers that a good faith interpretation of VCLT Article 30 does not support the conclusion that two treaties deal with the same subject matter simply because they may apply simultaneously to the same set of facts.307 Two different treaties may apply simultaneously to the same set of facts, or even share very broadly stated goals (such as \"integration\" or \"cooperation\" with other States) but approach the achievement of those goals from different perspectives.308 The Tribunal likewise agrees with the *EURAM* tribunal that the subject matter of a treaty \"is inherent in the treaty itself and refers to the issues with which its provisions deal, *i.e.* its topic or substance.\"309 Using those standards, however, the Tribunal likewise sees no reason to depart from consistent case law finding that the EU Treaties deal with a different subject matter than investment treaties.310 As noted above, the topic or substance of the EU Treaties was the creation of a common market between EU Member States, governed by EU law, whereas the topic or substance of the ECT was the creation of a broader multilateral network of energy cooperation, liberalization and investment, including through embracing certain reciprocal undertakings as a matter of international law. Moreover, although the \"same subject matter\" test in Article 30 is stated in terms of treaties as a whole, the key parts of the ECT for present purposes (ECT Parts III and V) address very specific topics of investment promotion and protection, and involve substantive and procedural protections that are not coincident with (or arguably, even of the same nature as) those offered under the EU Treaties' internal market provisions, which Italy itself admits \"do not 'deal' technically with promotion and protection of investments.\"311 Not surprisingly given these different regimes, the content of the standards is far from coextensive.312 The mere fact that protections under both regimes could be afforded in certain circumstances to the same investors - at least in the context of direct rather than indirect investment313 - does not conclusively demonstrate that the ECT and the EU Treaties themselves have the same subject matter for purposes of international law.\n\n*European American Investment Bank AG v.

Given this conclusion, there is no need for the Tribunal to reach the further question of whether specific provisions of the Lisbon Treaty are \"incompatible\" with those of the ECT as a matter of international law under VCLT Article 30(4). Nonetheless, the Tribunal observes that this would be unlikely given its conclusion in Section V.B.1.a above that the ECT does not command application of EU law in order to resolve disputes. As the Tribunal discusses further below in Section V.B.2, in the context of the *Achmea* Judgment, it is entirely possible to have two coexisting systems of law applicable to a particular fact scenario, in which the State conduct's may be adjudged independently by different authorities assessing obligations owed under different bodies of law. Indeed, this is frequently the case for States that are party to investment treaties, and as such have undertaken obligations to foreign investors governed by international law, separate from whatever obligations they already may owe such investors under their own domestic laws. The two regimes (international law and domestic law) exist independently, with neither necessarily usurping the role of the other.\n\n**e. EU Treaties as \"Agreements to Modify\" ECT: VCLT Article 41(1)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nFinally, Italy contends that \"by adhering to the Lisbon Treaty,\" EU Member States effectively \"modified\" the ECT pursuant to VCLT Article 41(1), to the extent of any intra-EU obligations they might previously have undertaken.314 The Commission presents an equivalent argument, stating that since the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon \"re-affirmed\" the investment protection rules of EU law as well as general principles concerning competences and judicial protection, this \"could be interpreted as an amendment [of the ECT] pursuant to Article 41(1)(b) VCLT.\"315 These arguments relate to the notion that under international law, a multilateral treaty may be modified not only collectively by all of its Contracting Parties, but also by a subset of those parties as between themselves, subject however to certain specified conditions. With respect to these conditions, Article 41 provides as follows:\n\n*Agreements to modify multilateral treaties between certain of the parties only*\n\n1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:\n\n(a) the possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or\n\n(b) the modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:\n\n(i) does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;\n\n(ii) does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole.\n\n2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph 1(a) the treaty otherwise provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty for which it provides.316\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 197.\n\nCommission Submission, \u00b6 127.\n\nVCLT, Article 41 (**CL-57)**.\n\n149.\n\nItaly contends that the conditions of VCLT Article 41(1)(b) are met in this case, because the Lisbon Treaty did not affect the enjoyment of ECT rights by any other ECT Contracting Parties.317 Eskosol contends that the conditions of Article 41(1)(b) are not met, both because the ECT (in its Article 16(2)) prohibits any modification that would result in derogation from ECT Parts III and V,318 and because such a modification would undermine the object and purpose of the ECT as a whole, which was to provide qualifying investors substantive protections and access to independent arbitration.319\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 216, 218-222.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6 81; Eskosol PHB, \u00b6 91.\n\nBifurcation Response, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, 91.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Article 41(1) argument at a more fundamental level, which is that nothing in the Lisbon Treaty even purported to be an exercise of powers to \"conclude an agreement to modify\" the ECT as among EU Member States, which must be the starting point of any Article 41(1) analysis. Nothing in the Lisbon Treaty refers to the ECT at all, much less expresses an intent to modify the ECT's reach or application. In that scenario, as the *Vattenfall* tribunal observed, \"[i]t is unclear what precise modification of the ECT is alleged to have taken place.\"320 Nor is there any suggestion that in enacting the Lisbon Treaty, the EU followed the procedures set out in Article 41(2) for advance notification of other ECT Contracting Parties of their intention to conclude an agreement which henceforth would legally modify ECT obligations among EU Member States. A useful contrast is provided by the Commission's approach to the International Energy Charter of 2015, where it formally declared, upon signing the document on behalf of the EU, that the Charter's dispute settlement mechanisms \"cannot be construed so as to mean that any such [arbitral] mechanisms would become applicable in relations\" between EU Member States.321 Yet the modification of an existing multilateral treaty under VCLT Article 41, no less than the conclusion of a new multilateral treaty, is intended to be a formal process, which the ILC describes as \"subject[]... to strict conditions\" both of substance and of procedure.322 The procedural conditions require notification to all other Contracting Parties \"in time for those parties to react.\"323 It is not consistent with that process for States to make no reference in an *inter se* agreement to any intention to formally modify or withdraw from prior commitments made through a multilateral instrument, and then subsequently claim - in the context of a challenge to compliance with obligations imposed by the multilateral instrument - that the *inter se* agreement modified the multilateral treaty *sub silentio* and without any prior notice to the other Contracting Parties.\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6 221 (**CL-193**).\n\nDeclaration of the European Union at the signing of the International Energy Charter (2015) (Annex **EC-16** to the Commission Submission).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 304 (**R-8**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \u00b6 316 (**R-8**).\n\n151.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the Lisbon Treaty was an \"agreement to modify\" the ECT within the sense of VCLT Article 41(1), nor that it complied with the procedural conditions for such a modification as set forth in Article 41(2). Moreover, the Tribunal further agrees with the *Vattenfall* tribunal that the particular modification of the ECT proposed in this case would be \"prohibited by the treaty\" contrary to VCLT Article 41(1)(b), because ECT Article 16(2) expressly prevents a later treaty from being construed so as to derogate from the \"more favourable\" rights granted to investors in Parts III and V of the ECT.324\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6 221 (**CL-193**).\n\n**2. The** ***Achmea*** **Judgment**\n------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nFor all the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not accept the argument that the progressive development of the EU Treaties, and in particular the conclusion of the Lisbon Treaty, requires as a matter of international law that intra-EU disputes be excluded from the ECT's scope. The Tribunal turns next to the argument that the CJEU's authoritative interpretation of EU law in the *Achmea* Judgment nonetheless compels such a result.\n\n153.\n\nIn conducting this analysis, the Tribunal emphasizes that it offers no criticism here of the *Achmea* Judgment as such. Whatever views may be held individually or collectively of a particular line of reasoning, the Tribunal accepts that the judgments of the CJEU constitute settled and decisive interpretations of the particular issues of EU law that they actually reach. However, the *implications* of such EU law decisions for proceedings in the broader international order, governed not by EU law but by multilateral agreements like the ICSID Convention and the ECT, remain open to assessment. The Tribunal focuses on these issues in the Section below.\n\n154.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal addresses in this Section several different reasons why it ultimately concludes that the *Achmea* Judgment, accepted as a valid decision concerning certain intra-EU BITs in the European legal order, does not disturb its jurisdiction to decide a dispute in the international legal order under the ECT. These points stand independently, and therefore the Tribunal could have chosen to rest on any one of them. Nonetheless, given the extensive attention that the Parties and the Commission have given to the *Achmea* Judgment in their most recent submissions, as well as the broader interest in this issue in the international community, the Tribunal addresses each point in the alternative, demonstrating why its jurisdiction would not be affected even if the other points were not also established or were later called into question by subsequent developments. First, however, the Tribunal provides a summary of the *Achmea* Judgment, reproducing relevant passages in the CJEU's own words.\n\n**a. Summary of the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe matter came before the CJEU on a request by the German Bundesgerichtshof for a preliminary ruling. In December 2012, an UNCITRAL tribunal had issued an arbitration award in favor of Achmea B.V., a Dutch company, finding that the Slovak Republic had violated certain obligations owned to the company under a bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (the \"***Achmea*** **BIT**\"). As the seat of the arbitration was in Frankfurt, the Slovak Republic brought a set-aside action before the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main, and when that court dismissed its action, the Slovak Republic appealed to the Bundesgerichtshof on a point of law.\n\n156.\n\nThe Bundesgerichtshof in turn decided to stay the appeal and sought a preliminary ruling from the CJEU on the following questions, referring to the text of Articles 18,325 267326 and 344327 of the TFEU:\n\n(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the investment protection agreement was concluded before one of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after that date?\n\nIf Question 1 is to be answered in the negative:\n\n(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision?\n\nIf Questions 1 and 2 are to be answered in the negative:\n\n(3) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the application of such a provision under the circumstances described in Question 1?328\n\nThe first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU (formerly Article 12 TEC) provides as follows:\n\nWithin the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.\n\nArticle 267 TFEU (formerly Article 234 TEC) provides as follows:\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:\n\n(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;\n\n(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;\n\nWhere such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.\n\nWhere any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.\n\nIf such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act with the minimum of delay.\n\nArticle 344 TFEU (formerly Article 292 TEC) provides as follows:\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 23 (**RL-85**).\n\n157.\n\nAdvocate General Wathelet proposed that the CJEU should answer these questions as follows:\n\nArticles 18, 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding the application of an investor/State dispute settlement mechanism established by means of a bilateral investment agreement concluded before the accession of one of the Contracting States to the European Union and providing that an investor from one Contracting State may, in the case of a dispute relating to investments in the other Contracting State, bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal.329\n\nCase No. C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 Sep. 2017, \u00b6 273 (**RL-91**).\n\n158.\n\nThe CJEU did not, however, accept Advocate General Wathelet's proposed resolution.\n\n159.\n\nInstead, it began by reformulating the questions posted by the Bundesgerichtshof, into a combined first and second questions framed as follows:\n\n31. By its first and second questions, which should be taken together, the referring court essentially asks whether Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding *a provision in an international agreement* concluded between Member States, *such as Article 8 of the BIT*, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.330\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 31 (**RL-85**) (emphasis added).\n\n160.\n\nThe CJEU's reformulation included a specific reference to Article 8 of the *Achmea* BIT. That clause provided first, in Article 8(1), that \"[a]ll disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\" Failing such a settlement, Article 8(2) of the *Achmea* BIT provided that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to an arbitral tribunal.\" The *Achmea* BIT then provided as follows in Article 8(6), regarding the law applicable to such a dispute:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively:\n\n- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\n- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\n- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;\n\n- the general principles of international law.331\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 6 (**RL-85**) (quoting Article 8 of the *Achmea* BIT).\n\n161.\n\nBeginning its analysis, the CJEU set out various EU law considerations which it considered relevant:\n\n32. In order to answer those questions, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the Treaties or, consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by the Court. That principle is enshrined in particular in Article 344 TFEU, under which the Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties....\n\n33. Also according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves. Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles, rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other....\n\n34. EU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss that each Member State shares with all the other Member States, and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which the EU is founded, as stated in Article 2 TEU. That premiss [sic] implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the Member States that those values will be recognised, and therefore that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It is precisely in that context that the Member States are obliged, by reason inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective territories the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those purposes any appropriate measure, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU....\n\n35. In order to ensure that the specific characteristics and the autonomy of the EU legal order are preserved, the Treaties have established a judicial system intended to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of EU law \u2026.\n\n36. In that context, in accordance with Article 19 TEU, it is for the national courts and tribunals and the Court of Justice to ensure the full application of EU law in all Member States and to ensure judicial protection of the rights of individuals under that law....\n\n37. In particular, the judicial system as thus conceived has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which, by setting up a dialogue between one court and another, specifically between the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of the Member States, has the object of securing uniform interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties....\n\n38. The first and second questions referred for a preliminary ruling must be answered in the light of those considerations.332\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 32-38 (**RL-85**) (citations omitted).\n\n162.\n\nThe CJEU then organized its analysis into three intermediary questions. The first was \"whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT is called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law*.*\"333 The CJEU answered this question in the affirmative, reasoning as follows:\n\n40. Even if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite the very broad wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT, is called on to rule only on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact remains that in order to do so it must, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting parties.\n\n41. Given the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in paragraph 33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States.\n\n42. It follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.334\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 39 (**RL-85**).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42 (**RL-85**).\n\n163.\n\nThe second intermediate question was \"whether an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in Article 8 of the BIT is situated within the judicial system of the EU, and in particular whether it can be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.\"335 The CEJ answered this question in the negative, on the basis that an international arbitral tribunal is neither part of the judicial system of a single EU Member State nor a court common to a number of such States.336\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 43 (**RL-85)**.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46 (**RL-85**).\n\n164.\n\nThe CJEU's third intermediate question was \"whether an arbitral award made by such a tribunal is, in accordance with Article 19 TEU in particular, subject to review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.\"337 It noted that under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, a tribunal may choose its own seat, and it was only by virtue of the chosen seat in this instance being Frankfurt that a set-aside proceeding was brought in the German courts.338 Even in these circumstances, moreover, judicial review was limited by German law to the validity of the arbitration agreement and the consistency of the award with public policy.339 While the CJEU had accepted the notion of limited review of commercial awards, \"provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can be examined in the course of that review and, if necessary, be the subject of a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling,\"340 it considered that \"arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 8 of the BIT are different from commercial arbitration proceedings.\" The CJEU explained as follows:\n\nWhile the latter originate in the freely expressed wishes of the parties, the former derive from a treaty by which Member States agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence from the system of judicial remedies which the second subparagraph of Article 19(1) TEU requires them to establish in the fields covered by EU law..., disputes which may concern the application or interpretation of EU law. In those circumstances, the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph relating to commercial arbitration cannot be applied to arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in Article 8 of the BIT.341\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 50 (**RL-85**).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52 (**RL-85**).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 53 (**RL-85**).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 54 (**RL-85**).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 55 (**RL-85**) (citations omitted).\n\n165.\n\nBased on this analysis, the CJEU considered as follows:\n\n56. Consequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT *...,* it must be considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law.\n\n57. It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected....\n\n58. In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in paragraph 34 above.\n\n59. In those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law.342\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 56-59 (**RL-85**).\n\n166.\n\nThe CJEU accordingly concluded as follows:\n\n60. Consequently, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\n\n62.... On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.343\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 62 (**RL-85**).\n\n**b. Whether the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment Reaches the ECT**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe first issue the Tribunal must address is whether the *Achmea* Judgment even reaches, from the standpoint of EU law, the jurisdiction of an ECT tribunal. It is common ground that there is no explicit reference in the *Achmea* Judgment to any application of its principles to the ECT, even though Advocate General Wathelet had expressly discussed the ECT in his Opinion submitted to the CJEU.344 The question is whether the CJEU nonetheless indirectly addressed ECT issues by the breadth of its analysis. The Parties disagree on this issue.345 The Tribunal considers that the decision does not reach the ECT, for several reasons.\n\nCase No. C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 Sep. 2017, \u00b6 43 (**RL-91**).\n\n*See* Italy PHB, \u00b6 135 (\"the Respondent does accept that *Achmea* does not directly address the ECT, but firmly affirms that the very same language and reasoning of the *Achmea* decision is exactly transposable to the ECT. The CJEU reasoning does apply to multilateral treaties like the ECT.\"): Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 81, 88 (Eskosol contending that \"the possible influence of the decision in *Achmea* is, rightly, limited in scope at most to intra-EU bilateral investment treaties and its reasoning does not extend to the ECT\" and that \"[e]ven the ECJ in *Achmea* recognized that international treaties to which the EU is a party are entirely different from BITs concluded between Member States\").\n\n168.\n\nFirst, the vocabulary used by the CJEU in its *dispositif* is an undeniable reference *only to bilateral treaties* among EU Member States, not multilateral treaties to which the EU itself gave imprimatur by virtue of ratification. It is true that the CJEU did not adopt the precise formulation presented by the Bundesgerichtshof, which had expressly referenced \"a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States,\"346 and instead replaced it with a formulation that does not expressly reference BITs. Nonetheless, consistent with the general principle that the CJEU usually answers the question asked to it and not others, the *dispositif* in two respects still clearly references bilateral treaties. The relevant language is italicized below:\n\nOn those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an *international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement* on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from *one of those Member States* may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in *the other Member State*, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.347\n\n*See* *Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 23 (**RL-85**) (reflecting the Bundesgerichtshof question, \"[d]oes Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a *bilateral investment protection agreement* between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which...\") (emphasis added)\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 62 (**RL-85**) (emphasis added).\n\n169.\n\nAs can be seen from the text, the phrase \"a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States\" is immediately qualified by the phrase \"*such as*,\" followed by a reference to Article 8 of the BIT at stake in the *Achmea* case. Taking that qualification into account, the Tribunal considers that the evident goal was not to restrict the *Achmea* Judgment to a single BIT, but rather to encompass *comparable provisions* in other international agreements *of a similar nature*. As to which features of an agreement supply the requisite similarities, the first evidently concerns the nature of the Contracting Parties. Here, the Tribunal refers to an agreement *\"between Member States,\"* rather than *among* States in general, including EU Member States. More importantly, it refers to an agreement under which \"an investor from *one* of those Member States\" has rights in the event of a dispute concerning investments in *the* other Member State,\" not *an* other Member State. The other language versions contain the same references: in French, it is referred to as \"un investisseur de *l'un* de ces Etats membres concernant des investissements dans *l 'autre* Etat membre,\" not \"dans *un autre* Etat membre\"; in German, as \"ein Investor *eines* dieser Mitgliedstaaten in Fall einer Streitigkeit uber Investitionen in *dem anderen*  Mitgliedstaat,\" not \"in *ein anderen* Mitgliedstaat\"; and in Spanish, as \"un inversor de *uno* de esos Estados miembros... en caso de controversia en *el otro* Estado miembro,\" not \"*en otro* Estado miembro.\" In the view of this Tribunal, these references refer only to a bilateral treaty, and cannot be simply presumed to extend *mutatis mutandis* to multilateral treaties involving non-EU Member States. The Tribunal notes that the *Masdar* and *Vattenfall* tribunals have reached the same conclusion.348\n\n*See* *Masdar*, \u00b6\u00b6 679-680 (**RL-90**); *Vattenfall*, \u00b6 162 (**CL-193**).\n\n170.\n\nSecond, other language used by the CJEU suggests an intent not to address a situation in which the *EU itself is a Contracting Party* to the same international agreement as its various Member States. In a paragraph almost immediately preceding its conclusion, the CJEU describes the situation before it as follows:\n\nIn the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by *an agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States*.349\n\nIf the CJEU did not consider this to be a relevant distinguishing feature, there would have been no reason to mention at all the absence of the EU as a Contracting Party to the *Achmea* BIT. The fact that the CJEU drew attention to the EU's absence as a party to the *Achmea* BIT, particularly in the wake of Advocate General Wathelet's discussion of the ECT in his Opinion, suggests an awareness that the EU's presence as a party to a different treaty (such as the ECT) could be a relevant factor. While the CJEU evidently did not consider it necessary to fully assess the implications of the distinction, it clearly was leaving room in the passage above for a possible distinction. This Tribunal should not assume that having done so, the CJEU nonetheless intended this to be a distinction without a difference.350\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 58 (**RL-85**) (emphasis added).\n\n*See* *Masdar*, \u00b6\u00b6 681-682 (**RL-90**); *Vattenfall*, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163, 213 (**CL-193);** *Greentech*, \u00b6 220 (**CL-195**).\n\n171.\n\nThird and most important, the CJEU was at pains throughout its analysis - as indicated *inter alia* in the passage above - to emphasize a concern about submission to arbitration of *disputes requiring application of EU law*. The issue of applicable law had been front and center in the Commission's own 2016 submission to the CJEU prior to the Judgment, and interestingly the Commission in that submission had used applicable law as its basis for distinguishing between (on the one hand) a bilateral treaty between two EU Member States, and (on the other hand) a treaty that the EU itself might conclude with non-EU Member States such as Singapore, Vietnam or Canada. The Commission presented its position on the latter by way of written observations to the CJEU as follows:\n\n157. This case concerns only an international investment protection agreement between two Member States.\n\n158. For the sake of completeness and to prevent any misunderstanding, the Commission stresses once more... that the considerations set out in this memorandum *are not transposable to the Union's international investment protection agreements with third countries*, such as those that it is about to conclude with Singapore, Vietnam and Canada.\n\n159. The Union's international investment protection agreements with third countries concern relations between the Union and those countries. They are very different, in many ways, from BITs concluded between Member States.\n\n160. First, the Court has explicitly recognized the compatibility of the establishment of dispute settlement mechanisms in agreements with third countries.\n\n161. Secondly, in relationships with third countries, neither Article 344 TFEU nor the premise of mutual trust in the jurisdiction of the Member States, which complete the Union's system of judicial protection, are applicable.\n\n162. Thirdly, the Union's investment protection agreements with third countries, such as those with Singapore, Vietnam and Canada, *regularly state in explicit terms that Union law does not apply, not as part of the law of the host country, nor as international law*. This last point is almost a self-evident fact since the third country is not a member of the Union. The dispute settlement mechanisms established by these agreements thus *concern only the application and interpretation of the Agreement and not the rest of Union law*. Its interpretation plays a role only as a factual element in the context of the finding of a possible breach of the agreement and in no way binds the courts of the Union.\n\n163. *Arbitral tribunals operating on the basis of these agreements must therefore only apply the investment protection rules enshrined in international law between the Union and the third country, and not those provided for by Union law*. Therefore, in the case of an investment protection agreement with third countries, the problem of material overlap with the protection of investments provided for by Union law does not arise in the same way as it does with the international investment protection agreements concluded between Member States.351\n\nWhile the Commission did not refer to the ECT in the passages above, its reasoning logically would extend to the ECT as well, since the EU treaties with Singapore, Vietnam or Canada likewise were envisioned as multilateral ones to which the individual EU Member States (and not just the EU itself) also would be Contracting Parties.\n\nEuropean Commission, Written Observations regarding a Prejudicial Decision, submitted pursuant to Article 23, second paragraph, of the protocol of the Court of Justice's statute (Ref. sj.c(2016) 5385926 - 30/08/2016). Unofficial translation from French original, available at available at:  \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/dgs/legal service/submissions/c2016 284 obs fr.pdf (emphasis added); no official English version provided by the European Commission.\n\n172.\n\nIn any event, the CJEU evidently shared the Commission's concern about applicable law. Its reasoning in the *Achmea* Judgment emphasized that under the particular terms of Article 8(6) of the *Achmea* BIT, an arbitral tribunal would have little choice but to interpret and apply EU law to the dispute, since EU law was incorporated by reference as mandatory law within the BIT's own applicable law clause. As indicated above, Article 8(6) provided that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal *shall* decide on the basis of the law, *taking into account in particular* though not exclusively\" four types of applicable law: (a) \"the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned,\" (b) \"the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties,\" (c) \"the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment,\" and (d) the general principles of international law.352 The CJEU considered *the first two* of these provisions to be problematic, stating that in order to \"rule... on possible infringements of the BIT,\" a tribunal applying the BIT \"*must*, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting party concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting parties.\"353 Yet, the CJEU observed that EU law has a dual nature which qualifies it as falling in both of these categories, namely as both \"part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement between the Member States.\"354 The CJEU concluded that \"on that *twofold basis* the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law.\"355 The *dispositif* of the *Achmea* Judgment then referred back to \"a provision... *such as* Article 8\" of the *Achmea* BIT, making clear that its Judgment related to the specific content of Article 8,356*i.e.*, the \"*twofold*\" respects in which Article 8 commanded that EU law be applied.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 4 (**RL-85**) (quoting Article 8 of the *Achmea* BIT) (emphasis added).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 40 (**RL-85**) (emphasis added).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 41 (**RL-85**).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 42 (**RL-85**) (emphasis added).\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 41 (**RL-85**).\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal has no quibble with the CJEU's observations about the dual nature of EU law, which has been recognized as well by prior investment tribunals, including in *AES v. Hungary*.357 Importantly, however, the CJEU did *not* consider EU law to come into the *Achmea* BIT on a *third* basis, namely by virtue of Article 8(6)'s incorporation by reference also of \"the general principles of international law.\" This too was a proper conclusion, because as the Tribunal explained in detail in Section V.B.1(a) above, the phrase \"general principles of international law\" is a term of art in international instruments, referring to customary international law accepted by all States and to principles of law generally recognized by all States in their municipal legal systems. The CJEU quite rightly did not contend that EU law qualified for inclusion in this rarified category of universally accepted norms. Nor did it express any concern about the authority of EU Member States to consent to adjudication of issues under \"general principles of international law.\" Rather, its stated concern was that *beyond* such general principles of international law, an arbitral tribunal empaneled under the *Achmea* BIT necessarily would have to apply EU law, by virtue of Article 8(6)'s mandate that a tribunal also apply the national law of the host State and the provisions of other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties.\n\n*See* *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erom\u00fc Kft v. The Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, \u00b6 7.6.6 (23 September 2010) (**RL-82**) (\"Regarding the Community competition law regime, it has a dual nature: on the one hand, it is an international law regime, on the other hand, once introduced in the national legal orders, it is part of these legal orders.\").\n\n174.\n\nThis is a critical distinction, because the ECT contains *no equivalent incorporation* into its applicable law of either category of law that the CJEU found offending in Article 8(6) of the *Achmea* BIT. As discussed at length in Section V.B.1(a), ECT Article 26(6) provides that tribunals shall decide disputes only under \"this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law,\" neither of which categories incorporates EU law. In these circumstances, the CJEU's concern about an arbitral tribunal applying EU law under the *Achmea* BIT is not directly transposable to the ECT. EU law simply is *not* part of the applicable law of any ECT dispute, under the very different provisions of ECT Article 26(6). As such, there is no equivalent risk that the arbitration mechanism in the ECT could endanger the CJEU's ultimate control on the application of EU law, which was the driving force in the *Achmea* Judgment about its decision about a \"provision in an international agreement... *such as* Article 8\" of the *Achmea* BIT.358\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 62 (**RL-85)** (emphasis added).\n\n175.\n\nIn this context, it bears emphasis that nothing in the CJEU's Judgment suggested that EU Member States were barred from offering to arbitrate disputes under treaties *not* governed even in part by EU law, but only by express treaty provisions and by general principles of international law. The *Achmea* Judgment was not predicated on the exclusive competence of the EU to enter into such treaties on its Member States' behalf. Rather, the Tribunal understands the *Achmea* Judgment more narrowly, as objecting only to treaty provisions that by their terms give tribunals the authority (or indeed the mandate) to decide a dispute among other things by reference to EU law, in either or both of the \"twofold\" aspects the CJEU identified.359 Put otherwise, it appears that EU Member States may bring arbitral tribunals into being for the purposes of deciding treaty disputes under general principles of international law, but are no longer allowed to authorize such disputes to apply EU law in addition. The ECT does not offend this limitation imposed by the *Achmea* Judgment.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 42 (**RL-85**).\n\n176.\n\nFinally, and for avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal sees no likelihood in this particular case that it even will need to interpret EU law as a *matter of fact,* relevant to its application of international law to decide the dispute in question. As noted above, there is no claim in this case by either Eskosol or Italy that the challenged government conduct by Italy was necessitated by EU directives. The case in that sense is similar to *Charanne* and *Novoenergia*, where the tribunals found that their cases did \"not involve any assessment of the validity of Community acts or decisions adopted by organs of the European Union,\" and did \"not concern in any way allegations... of violations of EU law nor claims directed against such organisation.\"360\n\n*Charanne*, \u00b6 448 (**CL-82**); *Novoenergia*, \u00b6 462 (**CL-191**) (quoting *Charanne* and stating that \"[t]his situation is similar\").\n\n177.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal sees no basis for finding that the *Achmea* Judgment extends to ECT cases, much less to this particular ECT case, *even by the CJEU's own analysis*. The CJEU's stated concern in paragraph 42 of the *Achmea* Judgment was about a circumstance in which an arbitral tribunal *\"may*  be called on to interpret or indeed to apply EU law,\"361 a scenario that the CJEU found to exist based on the applicable law clause in the particular BIT before it. But it would be inappropriate to extend that reasoning about a *possible* risk into a blanket ban on all investment arbitration, even under different scenarios where no equivalent risk arises. A concern that arbitration *in some cases* could endanger CJEU control over application of EU law does not logically support a finding that the *mechanism of arbitration* itself is improper; rather, the CJEU's logic suggests a need to determine whether the danger actually arises in the context of a particular treaty. Some intra-EU BITs, like the *Achmea* BIT, may require application of EU law, but other intra-EU BITs by their terms may not. In the context of the ECT, which the CJEU has not even discussed, it would be particularly surreal to interpret the CJEU as already having decided that the arbitral mechanism is contrary to EU law, when that mechanism as discussed above does not actually command the application of EU law, and thus decidedly does not pose the particular risk that the CJEU identified as its basis for concern.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 42 (**RL-85**) (emphasis added).\n\n**c. Whether the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment Binds This Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nA second and independent reason why the *Achmea* Judgment does not preclude this Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction - even *arguendo*, if it were deemed to extend to ECT cases as a matter of EU law - is that the decisions of the CJEU with respect to EU law are not binding on an international investment tribunal empaneled under a different legal order.\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that the CJEU did not purport to conduct any international law conflicts analysis. It concluded that an incompatibility existed between Article 8 of the *Achmea* BIT and the EU legal system, in particular Articles 267 and 344 TFEU. But the CJEU did not indicate by what means such an incompatibility should be resolved. It made no reference either to an alleged hierarchy of norms between EU law derived from the TFEU and general international law norms contained in an international investment treaty. The CJEU accordingly did not discuss any of the conflict of norms principles this Tribunal carefully examined in Section V.B.1 above, including application of VCLT Article 30, which is not even mentioned in the *Achmea* Judgment.\n\n180.\n\nThis Tribunal, by contrast, cannot simply skip over the relevant analysis, in blind deference to the CJEU's analysis under EU law. As the *Electrabel* tribunal clearly stated, a tribunal that \"has been seized as an international tribunal by a Request for Arbitration... under the ECT and the ICSID Convention\" is required accordingly to apply the ECT and \"applicable rules and principles of international law,\" because it \"is placed in a public international law context and not a national or regional context.\"362\n\n*Electrabel,* \u00b6\u00b6 4,111, 4,112 (**RL-58**).\n\n181.\n\nIt is useful to recall that the international legal system is a general system without any central authority from whom the entire system flows. It is composed of different legal sub-systems which have independent life, even if at times there may be interactions between them. As a whole, the international legal system is bound by general principles of international law, *i.e.*, by customary international law, including norms such as *jus cogens* and *pacta sunt servanda* as discussed above. But below this level of general principles there exist various sub-systems of international law, with no precise hierarchy between the different norms established in each sub-system. Rather, each of these sub-systems is governed by its own applicable norms, and vests dispute resolution authority in particular bodies obligated to proceed under those norms. The EU Treaties are one such sub-system, vesting authority in various organs including the Commission, the CJEU, etc. But the EU Treaties are not *general* international law displacing all other sub-systems of international law; rather, they exist side-by-side with other sub-systems, including those created by various multilateral treaties. The ECT is one such other sub-system of law, and it vests authority in arbitral tribunals such as this one. Each authority is empowered in its sub-system to render decisions within its sphere, such as the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment under the EU Treaties and the awards of various arbitral tribunals under the ECT. A given State may be subject to obligations arising from both types of decisions. This structure of international law may be graphically illustrated as below:\n\n![](http://img.jusmundi.com/image/decision/4e1e906a2660d50daaae769ab6e3b987f77634e7.png)\n\n182.\n\nIn the *Achmea* Judgment, the CJEU recognized that EU law exists in its own sub-system, which is \"autonom[ous]... with respect *both* to the law of the Member States and to international law.\"363 This autonomy means that EU law is different and separate not only from the national legal orders of its constituent States, but also from general international law, including other sub-systems of international law in the broader international legal order. Essentially, and as the CJEU itself has recognized, EU law is a *regional sub-system* of law. The CJEU explained many years ago in the famous *Van Gend en Loos* case, and has frequently reiterated since then,364 that \"[t]he Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have limited their sovereign rights...\"365 In the *Kadi* case, Advocate General Maduro's Opinion also described EU law as a \"municipal legal order of transnational dimension.\" It is even more accurately expressed in the French version: *\"un ordre juridique interne de dimension transnationale*.\"366 This means that EU law certainly has primacy over the national laws of EU Member States,367 but not in the same fashion over independent rules of international law.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 33 (**RL-85)** (stating that \"the autonomy of EU law *with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law* is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves.\") (emphasis added).\n\n*See, e.g.,* Opinion 2/13 of the Court (Full Court) of 18 December 2014, given to the Commission on the compatibility of draft agreement providing for the accession of the European Union to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms with the European Treaties (\"As the Court of Justice has repeatedly held, the founding treaties of the EU, unlike ordinary international treaties, established a new legal order, possessing its own institutions, for the benefit of which the Member States thereof have limited their sovereign rights, in ever wider fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only those States but also their nationals.\").\n\nCase 26/62, *NV Algemene Transporten Expeditie Onderneming van Gend & Loos v Netherlands Internal Revenue Administration* [1963] ECR 1, at Section B.\n\nOpinion of the Advocate General Maduro in Case C-402/05, *Kadi*, \u00b6 21, [2008] ECR I-6351 (**RL-96**).\n\nCJEU case law has confirmed that primacy of EC law over the domestic law of EU Member States is a cornerstone principle of Community law. According to the Court, this principle is inherent to the specific nature of the European Community, as stated in the judgment of *Costa and Enel*, 6/64, EU:C:1964:66, p. 594: \"It follows... that the law stemming from the treaty, an independent source of law, could not, because of its special and original nature, be overridden by *domestic legal provisions*, however framed, without being deprived of its character as Community law and without the legal basis of the Community itself being called into question.\"\n\n183.\n\nArbitration tribunals sitting in the general international legal order, for example in *Electrabel*, have considered that *at the procedural level*, there is no contradiction between investment arbitration (whatever its source) and EU law, in part because there remain mechanisms that guarantee the CJEU's control on the interpretation and application of EU law *on the merits* when there is a link with the EU legal order.368 The CJEU, sitting in the European regional legal order, evidently now considers to the contrary, *i.e.*, that the control it can exercise on investment arbitral awards is insufficient to satisfy its monopoly of application and interpretation of EU law. This creates a clear contradiction of positions. However, faced with such a contradiction, a tribunal situated on the international plane is not bound by the views adopted by the CJEU, *i.e.*, within a regional sub-system of international law. As the ILC itself recognized in its 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, \"when conflicts emerge between treaty provisions that have their home in different regimes, care should be taken so as to guarantee that any settlement is not dictated by organs exclusively linked with one or the other of the conflicting regimes.\"369 Nor can the notion of \"harmonious interpretation,\" while no doubt \"a desirable outcome\" in the words of the *Electrabel* tribunal, be transformed into a principle that compels an international law tribunal to abandon an international law conflicts analysis in favor of a very different conflicts analysis derived from EU law.370 Rather, if different rules deal with an issue in a way that seems contradictory, a tribunal empaneled under international law must do the best it can under the tools of interpretation provided by international law, including those \"regarding chronology (*lex posterior derogat priori*), specificity (*lex specialis generalibus derogat*) and identity of the Parties to the agreements (same or different Parties).... However, these rules do not always apply or can only be applied with difficulty.\"371\n\n*Electrabel,* \u00b6\u00b6 4,162 (\"In other words, even when disputes raising issues of EU law are decided by international arbitration, if the resulting award is honored voluntarily by the EU Member State or enforced judicially within the European Union against that Member State, the ECJ retains the possibility, through different mechanisms for both ICSID and non-ICSID awards under the EU Treaties, to exercise its traditional role as the ultimate guardian of EU law.\") (**RL-58**).\n\nILC 2006 Report on Fragmentation of International Law, p. 252 (**R-8**).\n\n*Electrabel,* \u00b6 4,130 (stating that while \"harmonious interpretation of different treaties... may be a desirable outcome... the end does not establish the means to that end\") (**RL-58**).\n\n*Electrabel,* \u00b6 4,173 (**RL-58**).\n\n184.\n\nUltimately, the bottom line is that in a case of contradiction, each legal order remains bound by its own rules, for purposes of its own judgments. The CJEU's conclusions regarding the EU legal order are addressed to EU Member States and European institutions, and they accordingly may have no choice but to take steps consistent with the CJEU's ruling, including submitting arguments to international tribunals based on the EU legal order. But the CJEU's conclusions derived from EU law do not alter this Tribunal's mandate to proceed under the legal order on which its jurisdiction is founded, namely the ECT. This means that an international investment tribunal empaneled under the ECT is not bound by the jurisprudence of the CJEU, just as the CJEU is not bound by decisions taken by ECT tribunals. Eskosol has quite rightly described this situation as follows:\n\n... this Tribunal's jurisdiction is derived from the ECT and its corresponding mandate is to interpret the terms of that international treaty and apply them to the facts of this case. By contrast, the ECJ derives its jurisdiction from the TFEU, specifically Article 267 which grants the ECJ jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning (a) the interpretation of the TFEU and the Treaty on European Union; and (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.\n\nTherefore, each of this Tribunal and the ECJ are judicial decision-making entities created by virtue of the provisions of the respective treaties from which they each derive their jurisdiction and authority. The decisions of the ECJ are thus not binding upon this Tribunal.372\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n\n185.\n\nThis conclusion is entirely consistent with those of many other investment tribunals, starting with the *Electrabel* tribunal, which emphasized that:\n\nThis Tribunal is an international tribunal established under the ECT and the ICSID Convention. From its perspective under international law, the Tribunal notes the establishment under international law of the Parties' consent to international arbitration under the ICSID Convention and also the effect of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, providing for ICSID arbitration \"to the exclusion of any other remedy\". It is therefore no answer for the European Commission to submit that the \"proper avenue\" for the Claimant lies only in \"the Community courts\", whether the Respondent's own national courts or the EC.373\n\nThe *Eiser* and *Novoenergia* tribunals observed to the same effect that their jurisdiction was based on the express terms of the ECT, that they were not constituted on the basis of the \"European legal order,\" and accordingly that they were not subject to the requirements of that legal order.374 The *Vattenfall* tribunal noted that there was \"no principle of public international law... which would permit the Tribunal to interpret the words of the ECT, being its foundational jurisdictional instrument, so as to give priority to external treaties (the TFEU and the TEU), and a court judgment interpreting those treaties.\"375 Finally, the *RREEF* tribunal explained the point as follows:\n\n75.... if there must be a \"*hierarchy\"* between the norms to be applied by the Tribunal, *it must be determined from the perspective of public international law, not of EU law*. Therefore, the ECT prevails over any other norm (apart from those of *ius cogens* - but this is not an issue in the present case). In this respect, this Tribunal fully agrees with the position of the tribunal in *Electrabel.*\n\n\u2026\n\n87. The Tribunal observes, however, that should it ever be determined that there existed an inconsistency between the ECT and EU law... and absent any possibility to reconcile both rules through interpretation, the unqualified obligation in public international law of any arbitration tribunal constituted under the ECT would be to apply the former. This would be the case even were this to be the source of possible detriment to EU law. *EU law does not and cannot \"trump\" public international law*.376\n\n*Electrabel,* \u00b6 5.37 (**RL-58**).\n\n*Eiser*, \u00b6 199 (**CL-149**); *Novoenergia*, \u00b6 461 (**CL-191**).\n\n*Vattenfall*, \u00b6 131 (**CL-193**).\n\n*RREEF*, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 87 (**CL-101**).\n\n186.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the *Achmea* Judgment were to be construed as a matter of EU law to extend to the ECT, and not just to BITs similar to the one actually before the CJEU, that would not deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction to decide this case. Indeed, the Tribunal not only has the right to exercise its jurisdiction under the ECT, it is under a duty to do so. The Tribunal is required to operate in the international legal framework of the ECT and the ICSID Convention, outside the EU and the dictates of EU law.\n\n**d. Whether the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment Invalidates ECT Provisions**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nEven if, *arguendo*, the *Achmea* Judgment were construed so as to reach issues under the ECT and to be binding on international arbitration tribunals, there is a third alternative reason why it nonetheless would not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction. That is because as a matter of international law, a court judgment of any scope or authority cannot without more automatically invalidate a treaty or an individual provision of a treaty.\n\n***i. There is no accepted ground for invalidation under the VCLT***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nFirst, there is no accepted ground for invalidation, as enumerated in the VCLT. Article 26 of the VCLT provides that \"[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\"377 This provision, a codification of the customary international law principle *pacta sunt servanda*, implies that a judgment of the CJEU cannot *by itself* put an end to the ECT, or even to one of its Articles. For that purpose, certain procedures have to be followed by States wishing to invalidate provisions, whether on the basis of a CJEU judgment that the ECT should be considered incompatible with EU law, or on any other basis.\n\nVCLT, Article 26 (**CL-57**).\n\n189.\n\nIn this respect, pursuant to Article 42 of the VCLT (to which both Italy and Belgium are parties), the validity of Italy's consent to be bound by a particular treaty can be challenged solely on the basis of the grounds set forth in the VCLT:\n\n*Validity and continuance in force of treaties*\n\n1. *The validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the present Convention*.\n\n2. The termination of a treaty, its denunciation or the withdrawal of a party, may take place only as a result of the application of the provisions of the treaty or of the present Convention. The same rule applies to suspension of the operation of a treaty.378\n\nVCLT, Article 42 (**CL-57**) (emphasis added).\n\n190.\n\nThe grounds for invalidating a treaty are set out in Articles 46 through 53 of the VCLT: (a) provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties (Article 46); (b) specific restrictions on authority to express consent of the State (Article 47); (c) error (Article 48); (d) fraud (Article 49); (e) corruption of a representative of a State (Article 50); (f) coercion of a representative of a State (Article 51); (g) coercion of a State by the threat or use of force (Article 52); and (h) conflict with a peremptory norm of general international law (Article 53). Of these, the only possible ground for invalidating Italy's consent to arbitration under the ECT would be the first, *i.e*. provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties, on the reasoning that the EU law, as interpreted by the CJEU, is part of the internal law of all EU Member States. But even analyzed from this angle, the VCLT is not of great assistance to Italy's case, as Article 46(1) of the VCLT specifies that provisions of a State's internal law may not be invoked to invalidate its consent to be bound by a treaty, unless the violation of internal law was \"manifest\" and concerned a \"rule of fundamental importance\":\n\n*Provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties*\n\n1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent *unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance*.\n\n2. A violation is *manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith*.379\n\nVCLT, Article 46 (**CL-57**) (emphasis added).\n\n191.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal need not engage in discussion of the second factor in Article 46(1), namely whether the rule of EU law at issue is \"of fundamental importance.\" That is because, in its view, any incompatibility between Article 26 of the ECT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU could not be considered as \"manifest\" before the *Achmea* Judgment, as required by VCLT Article 46(1) and as this this term is defined in VCLT Article 46(2).380\n\nIndeed, even after the *Achmea* Judgment it could be considered that incompatibility with the ECT was not \"manifest,\" considering the diverging Declarations of EU Member States with respect to the ECT that were made in January 2019, as discussed further in Section V.B.3 below.\n\n192.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recalls that, in the *Achmea* Judgment, the CJEU framed the incompatibility between intra-EU investment arbitration clauses and the TFEU in terms of the *mere potential* to threaten the full effectiveness of EU law, not as a *blatant* violation of EU law:\n\n56. Consequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT and set out in paragraphs 39 to 55 above, it must be considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties to it established *a mechanism* for settling disputes between an investor and a Member State *which could prevent* those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, *even though they might* concern the interpretation or application of that law...\n\n[\u2026]\n\n59. [\u2026] Article 8 of the BIT has an *adverse effect* on the autonomy of EU law.\"381\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 59 (**RL-85)** (emphasis added).\n\n193.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal recalls that the question of the compatibility of intra-EU investment treaties with EU law has been the subject of considerable debate. The position of the Commission itself has shifted. When the EU expanded to the East in 2004, the purported incompatibility between intra-EU arbitration clauses and EU law was not raised as an issue. Subsequently, the Commission took the view that Member States should begin proceedings to terminate intra-EU BITs according to their own terms. At that time, however, the Commission was careful to note that these agreements did not terminate or cease to apply automatically. Later, the Commission began arguing that intra-EU BITs already had ceased to apply on account of being incompatible with EU law, but this position was by no means universally accepted. Before the CJEU rendered its *Achmea* judgment, for example, Advocate General Wathelet expressed the opinion that no incompatibility existed between either intra-EU BITs and the ECT on the one hand and the EU Treaties on the other. The Tribunal considers that the shift in the Commission's own position, and the differing opinion of Attorney General Wathelet, perfectly illustrate that the issue of the arbitration clauses' compatibility with EU law - whether in bilateral or in multilateral treaties - remained very much an open and complex question until the CJEU rendered its first decision on the subject in the *Achmea* Judgment. In these circumstances, it was certainly not \"objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and good faith\"382 that the CJEU eventually would find an incompatibility to exist. In other words, the violation was not \"manifest\" within the meaning of VCLT Article 46(2) before the *Achmea* Judgment, and accordingly VCLT Article 46(1) is not a ground upon which Article 26 of the ECT can be invalidated, at least for purposes of disputes where the investor invoked that Article long before the *Achmea* Judgment was rendered.383\n\nVCLT, Article 46(2) (**CL-57**).\n\nWith respect to this temporal issue, *see also* Section V.B.2.e below.\n\n***ii. The procedures of the VCLT have not been followed***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nMoreover, even if the statement of preclusion in the *Achmea* Judgment were considered as a viable ground of invalidation under VCLT Article 46(2), such invalidation still must follow the established procedures in the VCLT. The only circumstance in which a treaty may be deemed automatically terminated under international law is where it is contrary to a norm of *jus cogens*, according to Article 64 of the VCLT : \"If a new peremptory norm of general international law emerges, any existing treaty which is in conflict with that norm becomes void and terminates.\"384 It is quite evident, however, that EU law does not qualify as a peremptory norm of general international law (or *jus cogens*) such that a conflict with its norms and principles would invalidate Italy's consent to be bound by the ECT.\n\nVCLT, Article 64 (**CL-57**).\n\n195.\n\nIn all other situations, procedures have to be followed to effectuate invalidation. These procedures are set forth in Articles 65 to 67 of the VCLT as follows:\n\nArticle 65  \n*Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a treaty*\n\n1. A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes either a defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty, terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation, must notify the other parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the measure proposed to be taken with respect to the treaty and the reasons therefor.\n\n2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency, shall not be less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no party has raised any objection, the party making the notification may carry out in the manner provided in article 67 the measure which it has proposed.\n\n3. If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall seek a solution through the means indicated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.385\n\n4. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall affect the rights or obligations of the parties under any provisions in force binding the parties with regard to the settlement of disputes.\n\n5. Without prejudice to article 45, the fact that a State has not previously made the notification prescribed in paragraph 1 shall not prevent it from making such notification in answer to another party claiming performance of the treaty or alleging its violation.\n\nArticle 66  \n*Procedures for judicial settlement, arbitration and conciliation*\n\nIf, under paragraph 3 of article 65, no solution has been reached within a period of 12 months following the date on which the objection was raised, the following procedures shall be followed:\n\n(*a*) any one of the parties to a dispute concerning the application or the interpretation of article 53 or 64 may, by a written application, submit it to the International Court of Justice for a decision unless the parties by common consent agree to submit the dispute to arbitration;\n\n(*b*) any one of the parties to a dispute concerning the application or the interpretation of any of the other articles in part V of the present Convention may set in motion the procedure specified in the Annex to the Convention by submitting a request to that effect to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nArticle 67  \n*Instruments for declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty*\n\n1. The notification provided for under article 65, paragraph 1, must be made in writing.\n\n2. Any act of declaring invalid, terminating, withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty pursuant to the provisions of the treaty or of paragraphs 2 or 3 of article 65 shall be carried out through an instrument communicated to the other parties. If the instrument is not signed by the Head of State, Head of Government or Minister for Foreign Affairs, the representative of the State communicating it may be called upon to produce full powers.386\n\nArticle 33 of the UN Charter provides: \"The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"\n\nVCLT, Articles 65-67 (**CL-57**).\n\n196.\n\nIn other words, successive steps have to be followed. The first step, pursuant to Article 65(1) of the VCLT, involves a notification to the other party or parties to the treaty in question of its view that there was a \"defect in its consent to be bound\" by that treaty or another recognized ground for impeaching the validity of the treaty. The notice should include a proposal for the measure to be taken as a consequence of such defect. Second, pursuant to Article 65(2) of the VCLT, if the party thus notified does not react after a period of at least three months, then the party invoking invalidity can adopt the measure it proposed to rectify the situation. By contrast, if the party notified objects, then (pursuant to Article 65(3) of the VCLT) the two parties have to resort to some means of dispute settlement, like mediation or arbitration. The third step is that, if no solution has been found in 12 months after the objection was raised, then the parties should present their dispute to the ICJ, pursuant to Article 66 of the VCLT. In the meantime, Article 65(4) states that \"[n]othing in the foregoing paragraphs shall affect the rights or obligations of the parties under any provisions in force binding the parties with regard to the settlement of disputes.\"\n\n197.\n\nIn this case, none of these steps required to invalidate the ECT or its Article 26 have been completed. As previously noted in Section V.A.1, Italy did take steps to withdraw entirely from the ECT, but this is subject to the 20-year sunset provision of ECT Article 47(3),387 and is far different from claiming an invalidity in its original consent to be bound by the ECT based on an incompatibility with its internal law. It results that unless and until Italy or other EU Member States pursue the procedures established by the ECT for declaring invalidity of their consent, the ECT remains in full effect for them, subject to the timetable provided by the sunset provision for those who (like Italy) have given notice of an intent to withdraw.\n\nECT Art. 47(3) (**C-1**).\n\n198.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that whatever the scope and reach of the *Achmea* Judgment may be, it cannot be considered as a matter of international law to automatically invalidate, for Italy or any under EU Member State, either the ECT as a whole or the consent to arbitration reflected in Article 26 of the ECT. The Tribunal considers that the principle of legal certainty entitles investors to rely legitimately upon a State's written consent to arbitrate disputes, as long as that consent has not been withdrawn or invalidated through the proper procedures, including those set forth in the underlying treaty and the express provisions in the VCLT.\n\n**e. Whether the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment Retroactively Invalidates Consent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nFinally, even if all of the prior grounds established in Sections V.B.2.b, V.B.2.c and V.B.2.d were not an issue with respect to the *Achmea* Judgment's possible invalidation of EU Member State consent to ECT arbitration generally, they still would not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction to resolve this particular case. That is because any invalidation of ECT Article 26 could not be applied *retroactively* to invalidate a consent to arbitration given before the *Achmea* Judgment, but only prospectively for purposes of investors who have not yet initiated an ECT arbitration. In the Tribunal's view, this conclusion holds whether the *Achmea* Judgment *itself* is considered under EU law to be applied *ex nunc* (*i.e.,* for the future, starting from the date of the Judgment) or alternatively *ex tunc* (*i.e.,* from the outset, dating back to ratification of the ECT allegedly without proper consent).\n\n***i. The analysis if the Achmea Judgment is prospective only under EU law***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe outcome in the first scenario, in which as a matter of EU law the *Achmea* Judgment is considered as having only prospective effects, is straightforward to explain.\n\n201.\n\nThe jurisdiction of an international tribunal must be evaluated as of the date when the parties have given their consent to submit a dispute to arbitration. In this case, Article 26(3) of the ECT states that \"each Contracting Party hereby gives its *unconditional consent* to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article,\" including various procedural options, one of which is ICSID arbitration.388 Eskosol has chosen ICSID arbitration as among the options available to it. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in turn provides that \"[w]hen the parties have given their consent, *no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally*.\"389 In other words, once consent for arbitration under the ICSID Convention has been given, it becomes irrevocable, and no posterior event can annul such consent retroactively.\n\nECT, Article 26(3) (**C-1**) (emphasis added).\n\nICSID Convention, Article 25(1) (emphasis added).\n\n202.\n\nIt is not controversial that the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal is fixed at the moment the proceedings are deemed to have commenced. This has been stated repeatedly by ICSID tribunals. For example, the tribunal in the *CSOB* case stated that \"it is generally recognized that the determination whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted.\"390 Support for this proposition also can be found in the *Vivendi* case, where the tribunal explained as follows:\n\n61. This is not only a principle of ICSID proceedings; it is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined in the light of the situation as it existed on the date when the proceedings were instituted. Events that take place before that date may affect jurisdiction; events that take place after that date do not. The ICJ developed cogent case law to this effect in the *Lockerbie case*. There, in a preliminary objection, Libya relied on the Montreal Convention to establish the Court's jurisdiction. The United States and the United Kingdom contended that Security Council Resolutions adopted after the initiation of the proceedings deprived the Court of jurisdiction. The Court rejected categorically the arguments of the United States and the United Kingdom, deciding that:\n\n\"The Court cannot uphold this line of argument. Security Council Resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) were in fact adopted after the filing of the Application on 3 March 1992. In accordance with its established jurisprudence **,** *if the Court had jurisdiction on that date, it continues to do so. The subsequent coming into existence of the above-mentioned Resolutions cannot affect its jurisdiction once established...\"*\n\n62. The Court confirmed this rule in the *Arrest Warrant case*, where it stated:\n\n\"The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed. Thus, *if the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case is referred to it, it continues to do regardless of subsequent events.* Such events might lead to a finding that an application has subsequently become moot and to a decision not to proceed to judgment on the merits, but they cannot deprive the Court of jurisdiction...\"\n\n63. The consequence of this rule is that, *once established, jurisdiction cannot be defeated. It simply is not affected by subsequent events*. Events occurring after the institution of proceedings (other than, in a case like this, an *ad hoc* Committee's Decision to annul the prior jurisdictional finding) cannot withdraw the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute.391\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 3 (24 May 1999) (**CL-157**).\n\n*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (formerly *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentine Republic*), Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 61-63 (14 November 2005) (**RL-37**) (emphasis added).\n\n203.\n\nThere is no question that the *Achmea* Judgment itself was an event posterior to the commencement of these proceedings. Accordingly, if that Judgment is itself deemed to be prospective only, it cannot affect the consent granted by *both Parties* prior to the date on which it was rendered.\n\n***ii. The analysis if the Achmea Judgment is retroactive under EU law***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nEven if as a matter of EU law the *Achmea* Judgment is considered to be *ex tunc*, in the sense that Italy lacked consent from the inception to agree to Article 26 of the ECT, this still would not imply that Eskosol's acceptance - prior to the *Achmea* Judgment - of Italy's apparent offer of ECT arbitration is considered to be void. This follows from Article 69 of the VCLT regarding the consequences under international law of the invalidity of a treaty because of lack of consent.\n\n205.\n\nArticle 69 of the VCLT provides as follows:\n\n*Consequences of the invalidity of a treaty*\n\n1. A treaty the invalidity of which is established under the present Convention is void. The provisions of a void treaty have no legal force.\n\n2. *If acts have nevertheless been performed in reliance on such a treaty* :\n\n(a) each party may require any other party to establish as far as possible in their mutual relations the position that would have existed if the acts had not been performed;\n\n(b) *acts performed in good faith before the invalidity was invoked are not rendered unlawful by reason only of the invalidity of the treaty*.\n\n3. In cases falling under articles 49, 50, 51 or 52, paragraph 2 does not apply with respect to the party to which the fraud, the act of corruption or the coercion is imputable.392\n\nVCLT, Article 69 (**CL-57**) (emphasis added).\n\n206.\n\nUnder Article 69(1), the general rule is that invalidation of a treaty based on the absence of consent operates retroactively, with the effect that the provisions of that treaty are \"void\" and \"have no legal force.\" Consistent with the general rule, the parties to the treaty may require each other to restore the situation that existed as between them *ex ante* (*restitutio in integrum*). However, there is an important exception to this rule stated in Article 69(2)(b), under which acts that have been performed \"in good faith before the invalidity was invoked\" are not considered unlawful simply because of invalidity of the treaty. In the Tribunal's view, this is the case for arbitration agreements perfected before the *Achmea* Judgment, in reliance on EU Member States' apparent offer of consent to investor-State arbitration under the ECT or other treaties. The conclusion that investors accepted that apparent offer in good faith follows from the point, discussed above, that any invalidity in the offer of consent was far from \"manifest\" prior to the *Achmea* Judgment. Indeed, lack of consent was neither manifested in the text of the ECT itself; the contemporaneous conduct of the Commission and EU Member States, none of which \"sought an opinion from the Court on the compatibility of that treaty with the EU and FEU Treaties\";393 and the subsequent shifting positions of the Commission regarding whether additional action by EU Member States would be required in order to terminate intra-EU treaties. It was not until the CJEU actually issued the *Achmea* Judgment that, at the very *earliest*, given persisting debate about whether that Judgment even reaches the ECT, it could be said that investors were placed on notice about the risks of relying on Member States' apparent consent to arbitration in Article 26 of the ECT.\n\nCase No. C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 Sep. 2017, \u00b6 43 (**RL-91**).\n\n**3. The January 2019 Members' Declaration**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to Italy's Termination Request on 4 February 2019, by which it requested \"an award declaring immediate termination\" of this arbitration, by virtue of the January 2019 Declaration filed by 22 EU Member States, including Italy and Belgium.\n\n208.\n\nAs it will be recalled, the January 2019 Declaration was entitled \"Declaration of the Governments of the Member States on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union.\" Citing the *Achmea* Judgment, the January 2019 Declaration first stated that \"Member States are bound to draw all necessary consequences from that judgment pursuant to their obligations under Union law.\"394 The rest of the Declaration may be divided into two parts, the first expressing views on certain legal issues in the wake of the *Achmea* Judgment,395 and the second declaring that in accordance with those views, the 22 EU Member States \"will undertake the following actions without undue delay.\"396\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 1.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, pp. 1-2.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, pp. 3-4.\n\n209.\n\nRegarding the legal issues, the signatories state *inter alia* as follows:\n\nUnion law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States.1 As a consequence, all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable. They do not produce effects including as regards provisions that provide for extended protection of investments made prior to termination for a further period of time (so-called sunset or grandfathering clauses). An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty.\n\nFurthermore, international agreements concluded by the Union, including the Energy Charter Treaty, are an integral part of the EU legal order and must therefore be compatible with the Treaties.2 Arbitral tribunals have interpreted the Energy Charter Treaty as also containing an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between Member States.3 Interpreted in such a manner, that clause would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied.4397\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, pp. 1-2.\n\n210.\n\nThe passages above contain several footnotes. The first footnote, following the statement that \"Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States,\" cites certain CJEU judgments and then asserts, without any analysis or citations, that \"[t]he same result follows also under general public international law, in particular from the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties and customary international law (*lex posterior*).\"398 The second footnote, following the statement that the ECT \"must be compatible with the Treaties,\" states that \"[f]or the Energy Charter Treaty, its systemic interpretation in conformity with the Treaties precludes intra-EU investor-State arbitration.\"399 The fourth footnote, following the statement that if the ECT's investor-State arbitration clause were interpreted as applicable between Member States, \"that clause would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied,\" cites only to the Commission's own 2018 Communication on \"Protection of intra-EU investment.\"400\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 1, n. 1.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 2, n. 2.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 2, n. 4.\n\n211.\n\nRegarding the actions to be taken by the 22 signatories, the January 2019 Declaration pledges that they will \"undertake the following,\" *inter alia* :\n\n1. By the present declaration, Member States inform arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the *Achmea* judgment, as set out in this declaration, in all pending intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings brought either under bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States or under the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\n2. In cooperation with a defending Member State, the Member State, in which an investor that has brought such an action is established, will take the necessary measures to inform the investment arbitration tribunals concerned of those consequences. Similarly, defending Member States will request the courts, including in any third country, which are to decide in proceedings relating to an intra-EU investment arbitration award, to set these awards aside or not to enforce them due to a lack of valid consent.\n\n3. By the present declaration, Member States inform the investor community that no new intra-EU investment arbitration should be initiated.\n\n\u2026\n\n5. In light of the *Achmea* judgment, Member States will terminate all bilateral investment treaties concluded between them by means of a plurilateral treaty or, where that is mutually recognised as more expedient, bilaterally.\n\n\u2026\n\n8. Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance of that plurilateral treaty or of any bilateral treaty terminating bilateral investment treaties between Member States no later than 6 December 2019.\n\n9. Beyond actions concerning the Energy Charter Treaty based on this declaration, Member States together with the Commission will discuss without undue delay whether any additional steps are necessary to draw all the consequences from the *Achmea* judgment in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.401\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, pp. 3-4.\n\n212.\n\nItaly has now followed through on the first undertaking above, by virtue of informing this Tribunal about the January 2019 Declaration in its letter of 4 February 2019. Having been so informed, the question for the Tribunal is whether the January 2019 Declaration has legal significance for its jurisdiction to proceed in this case.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal's first observation is that in their statements regarding legal issues on the first pages of the January 2019 Declaration, the signatories have gone far beyond the actual holding in the *Achmea* Judgment. First, as discussed in Section V.B.2.b above, it is far from clear whether the *Achmea* Judgment stands for the proposition that \"*all* investor-state arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties... are contrary to Union law,\"402 or simply those with a \"provision... *such as* Article 8\" of the *Achmea* BIT,403*i.e.*, clauses that make EU law part of the applicable law of the treaty and thus require tribunals to apply EU law in reaching their decision.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 1.\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00b6 62 (**RL-85)** (emphasis added).\n\n214.\n\nSecond, even if the *Achmea* Judgment did stand for a proposition regarding \"all\" intra-EU BITs, it does not address the ECT, much less state that the ECT's arbitration clause - which contains no command about applying EU law, and to which the EU also agreed by becoming a Contracting State - itself \"would be incompatible with the Treaties.\"404 There is nothing in the *Achmea* Judgment that even purports to reach the conclusion in the second footnote of the January 2019 Declaration, namely that a \"systemic interpretation [of the ECT] in conformity with the Treaties precludes intra-EU investor-State arbitration.\"405 This reality was emphasized by the six other EU Member States that have declined to express a view at this time regarding the compatibility of EU law and the ECT, based on the *Achmea* Judgment's complete silence about the ECT in its analysis.406\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 1.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 2, n. 2.\n\nFor example, in a Declaration signed on 16 January 2019, Hungary stated that \"in its view, the *Achmea* Judgment concerns only intra-EU bilateral treaties. The *Achmea* Judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the [ECT] and it does not concern any pending or prospective arbitration proceedings initiated under the ECT. Against this background, Hungary underlines the importance of allowing for due process and considers that it is inappropriate for a Member State to express its views as regards the compatibility with Union law of the intra-EU application of the ECT.\" Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden expressed a similar position in another Declaration signed on 16 January 2019.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the *Achmea* Judgment was restricted to a discussion of EU law, and nowhere purported to discuss the broader international law consequences of its findings regarding EU law. There is no discussion whatsoever in the *Achmea* Judgment of the points asserted in the first footnote of the January 2019 Declaration, namely that \"[t]he same result follows also under general public international law, in particular from the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties and customary international law (*lex posterior*).\"407 It certainly did not explain, as a matter of either VCLT conflicts analysis or VCLT rules on invalidity of treaty provisions, that intra-EU arbitration clauses are \"inapplicable\" and \"would have to be disapplied,\" with the effect that an \"arbitral tribunal established on the basis of [such] clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate.\"408\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 1, n. 1.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, pp. 1-2.\n\n216.\n\nIn other words, these particular assertions by the 22 Member State signatories are not grounded in the express findings of the CJEU in the *Achmea* Judgment, but merely reflect the signatories' own interpretation of the further \"legal consequences of the judgment,\" as the title of the January 2019 Declaration reflects. Moreover, in expressing that interpretation the signatories made no reference to any international law analysis. There is no attempt in the January 2019 Declaration to work through, for example, the impact of the numerous VCLT provisions this Tribunal has carefully analyzed above.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that important language in the signatories' undertakings is stated in the future tense. For example, in undertaking numbers 5 and 8 the signatories state that they \"*will terminate*\" all bilateral investment treaties concluded between them, and \"*will make best efforts*\" to complete this process by 6 December 2019. With respect to the ECT, the signatories state in undertaking number 9 they state that they *\"will discuss...* whether any additional steps are necessary to draw all the consequences from the *Achmea* judgment in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.\"409 The use of the future tense suggests that the signatories do not believe their intra-EU BITs already have been terminated for invalidity of the underlying consent, much less that an equivalent result already has been accomplished with respect to the intra-EU application of the ECT. As discussed above in Section V.B.2.d, the VCLT provides specific procedures in this regard, yet there is no assertion in the January 2019 Declaration that these procedures have been commenced, much less completed.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, pp. 3-4 (emphasis added).\n\n218.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to accept Italy's assertion that the mere fact that Italy and Belgium both signed the 2019 Declaration requires termination of these proceedings. The proposition would require a finding that even with no analysis to support its key assertions regarding international law, the 2019 Declaration qualifies *simply by its existence* as a \"binding instrument\" amounting to a \"shared understanding... regarding the interpretation of the ECT,\"410 and moreover one that applies even to cases that were filed years before any such interpretation was declared, based on the plain meaning of a treaty text that has been in force for decades. Yet, neither VCLT Article 31(2)(b) or VCLT Article 31(3)(a), which Italy invokes in support of this position,411 requires such a result.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7.\n\nTermination Request, p. 2.\n\n219.\n\nFirst, VCLT Article 31(2)(b) provides that \"[t]he context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text,... any instrument which was made by one or more parties *in connection with the conclusion of the treaty* and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\"412 Yet, the January 2019 Declaration was not \"made... in connection with the conclusion\" of the ECT, in the sense that various instruments deposited as part of its ratification process were, and thus hardly can be considered a reliable record of the contemporaneous understanding of the relevant Contracting Parties at the time the ECT came into force. To the contrary, it was issued *25 years after* the \"conclusion\" of the ECT, in the context of pending arbitrations against various EU Member States. The Tribunal does not interpret VCLT Article 31(2)(b) as requiring obedience to *post-hoc* statements of this sort as relevant (much less determinative) \"context\" for interpreting the original intent of these Contracting Parties.\n\nVCLT, Article 31(2)(b) (**CL-57**) (emphasis added).\n\n220.\n\nDifferent considerations apply to VCLT Article 31(3)(a), which does address a \"subsequent agreement\" as distinct from one made \"in connection with the conclusion\" of a treaty. Article 31(3)(a) states that \"[t]here shall be taken into account, together with the context... any subsequent agreement *between the parties* regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions.\"413 The first point here is that there is a significant distinction in international law between interpretations agreed by *all* Contracting Parties to a multilateral treaty, and those offered unilaterally by *only a subset* of such Parties. This point is firmly established by the very authority Italy invokes in support of its arguments, namely the ILC's 2001 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, which distinguishes between \"interpretative declarations\" made unilaterally by one or more States or international organizations and those accepted by *all* signatories to a particular treaty. In particular, \"[t]he joint formulation of an interpretative declaration by several States or international organizations does not affect the unilateral character of that interpretative declaration,\"414 whereas \"[a]n interpretative declaration that has been approved by all the contracting States and contracting organizations may constitute an agreement regarding the interpretation of the treaty.\"415\n\nVCLT, Article 31(3)(a) (**CL-57**) (emphasis added).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Guideline 1.2.1, p. 2 (**RL-102**).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties **,** Guideline 4.7.3, p. 27 (**RL-102**); *see also id.*, Comments (1) and (2) to Guideline 4.7.3, p. 559 (\"Assent to an interpretive declaration by all the other parties to the treaty... radically alters the situation.... Unanimous agreement by all the parties therefore constitutes a true interpretative agreement which represents the will of the 'masters of the treaty' and thus an authentic interpretation.\").\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept Italy's suggestion that the critical requirement of unanimity in a subsequent agreement on interpretation can be dispensed with in the ECT context, since any particular arbitration will involve only two interested States (the investor's home State and the host State of the investment), who have \"reciprocal\" obligations.416 While it may be true that only Belgium and Italy have any stake specifically in this arbitration, this does not mean that the *terms* of the ECT can be transformed simply by their bilateral agreement. As previously discussed, the terms of a multilateral treaty must be given a consistent meaning, not varying meanings depending which particular States may have concrete interests in the outcome of a particular dispute and/or subsequently agree to particular interpretations.\n\nTermination Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\n222.\n\nA further difficulty with Italy's reliance on the January 2019 Declaration is that it does not actually purport to \"interpret\" any particular term of the underlying treaty, such as the terms \"Contracting Party,\" \"REIO\" or \"Area\" that the Tribunal assessed through a detailed VCLT Article 31 analysis in Section V.A. above. To the contrary, while denominated as \"interpretation,\" the Declaration is more a statement of current political will. This is quite different from the types of \"subsequent agreements\" that VCLT Article 31(3)(a) was intended to address. As the ILC's 1966 Commentaries on the Draft VCLT Articles discuss regarding this provision, \"[a] question of fact may sometimes arise as to whether an *understanding reached during the negotiations* concerning the meaning of a provision was or was not intended to constitute an agreed basis for its interpretation.\"417 The January 2019 Declaration does not assert, however, that any understanding regarding ECT Article 26(6)'s application to intra-EU disputes actually was reached during the ECT negotiations. To the contrary, it seems that the issue was not discussed at all, likely because (as Advocate General Wathelet has suggested) neither the EU Member States nor the Commission at the time \"had the slightest suspicion that [Article 26(6)] might be incompatible\" with EU law.418\n\n*See* ILC Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, 1966, p. 221 (Art. 27, Commentary, item 14) (emphasis added).\n\nCase No. C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 Sep. 2017, \u00b6 43 (**RL-91**).\n\n223.\n\nThe goal of the January 2019 Declaration thus appears less to confirm a shared understanding *at the time*, but rather to offer a *new understanding* (as among the 22 signatories) for the purposes of overriding interpretations of the ECT that arbitral tribunals have reached in various intra-EU disputes.419 VCLT Article 31(3)(a) is not, however, a trump card to allow States to offer new interpretations of old treaty language, simply to override unpopular treaty interpretations based on the plain meaning of the terms actually used. Indeed, the ILC was quite clear in its 1966 Commentaries that even a *contemporaneous* document \"made... in connection with the conclusion of the treaty,\" within the meaning of what became VCLT Article 31(2)(b), is \"not... necessarily to be considered as an integral part of the treaty,\" but simply as \"part of the context for the purpose of arriving at the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty.\"420 This is all the more true for an interpretative declaration, which \"does not modify treaty obligations,\" but \"may only specify or clarify the meaning or scope which its author attributes to a treaty... and may, as appropriate, constitute an element to be taken into account in interpreting the treaty in accordance with the general rule of interpretation of treaties.\"421\n\n*See* January 2019 Declaration, p. 2 (\"Arbitral tribunals have interpreted the Energy Charter Treaty as also containing an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between Member States.\")\n\n*See* ILC Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, 1966, p. 221 (Art. 27, Commentary, item 13).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Guideline 4.7.1.1, p. 26 (**RL-102**).\n\n224.\n\nIn particular, an interpretative declaration may \"corroborate or 'support' an interpretation that has already been determined by other methods,\" such as \"the objective elements listed in articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention,\" but it cannot override the application of those elements.422 The ILC explains that:\n\nIt is therefore clear from practice and doctrinal analyses that interpretative declarations come into play only as an auxiliary or complementary means of interpretation corroborating a meaning revealed by the terms of the treaty, considered in light of its object and purpose. As such, they do not produce an autonomous effect: when they have an effect at all, interpretive declarations are associated with another instrument of interpretation, which they usually uphold.423\n\nThe ILC explains the bottom line as follows: \"Whether or not the interpretation is correct, its author remains bound by the provisions of the treaty.\"424\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Comment (26) on Guideline 4.7.1, p. 555 (**RL-102**).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Comment (31) on Guideline 4.7.1, p. 556 (**RL-102**).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Comment (7) on Guideline 4.7.1, p. 549 (**RL-102**).\n\n225.\n\nAs Eskosol notes,425 there can also be a fine line between an interpretive declaration and an attempted reservation to a treaty, which becomes particularly important in cases where a treaty unambiguously prohibits the latter. This is the case for the ECT, which states authoritatively in Article 46: \"No reservations may be made to this Treaty.\"426 The ILC cautions not to defer to mere labels in distinguishing between the two.427 Rather, its Guideline 1.3.3 offers a practical distinction, namely that \"[w]hen a treaty prohibits reservations to all or certain of its provisions, a unilateral statement formulated in respect of those provisions... nevertheless constitutes a reservation if it purports to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty, or of the treaty as a whole with respect to certain specific aspects, in their application as to its author.\"428 In other words:\n\nIn determining the legal nature of a statement formulated in connection with a treaty, the decisive criterion lies in the effective result that implementing the statement has (or would have). If it results (or would result) in modifying or excluding the legal effect of the treaty or certain of its provisions, it is a reservation \"however phrased or named\"; if the statement simply clarifies the meaning or scope that its author attributes to the treaty or certain of its provisions, it is an interpretative declaration.429\n\nApplying this standard, the ultimate effect of the 2019 Declaration would be to significantly modify the legal reach of Article 26(6) of the ECT as otherwise interpreted pursuant to the ordinary meaning of its terms, with the effect of excluding that reach entirely in any intra-EU dispute brought against any of the 22 signatories. That is more in the nature of an attempted reservation to the ECT than a simple clarification in support of the plain meaning of the text.\n\nTermination Rejoinder, pp. 2-3.\n\nECT Article 46 (**C-1**).\n\n*See* ILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, pp. 63-65 (Comment (5)) (**RL-102**).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, Guideline 1.3.3, p. 3 (**RL-102**).\n\nILC 2011 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, p. 76, Comment (3) (**RL-102**).\n\n226.\n\nFinally, even if the January 2019 Declaration were to be treated as a binding joint interpretation of ECT Article 26(6) on a prospective basis, the Tribunal is unable to accept that it should be given retroactive effect to require the termination of a pending arbitration, initiated in good faith by an investor years before the Declaration was issued, and indeed already *sub judice* as of its issuance. Giving it such effect in a pending case would go against the security of the legal order intended to be achieved by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, namely that \"[w]hen the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" The ECT itself contains protections against revocation of specific assurances provided to investors, through the concept of legitimate expectations embodied in fair and equitable treatment. In the Tribunal's view, it would be inconsistent with general notions of acquired rights under international law to permit States effectively to non-suit an investor part-way through a pending case, simply by issuing a joint document purporting to interpret longstanding treaty text so as to undermine the tribunal's jurisdiction to proceed. Such a result would be particularly inappropriate to condone, where the express words of the joint document reveal that the signatories themselves do not believe the treaty has yet been terminated, but simply plan to \"discuss without undue delay whether any additional steps are necessary\" to achieve the desired result.430\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 4, \u00b6 9.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal adds, as a final note, that the January 2019 Declaration seems to be, by its own word, only a means of *information* of the position of the EU Member States signatories of this Declaration,431 which have now aligned with the Commission position. It indicates also, as already mentioned, that no EU Member State considers that its intra-EU BITs or the ECT have automatically been terminated by virtue of either the *Achmea* Judgment or the January 2019 Declaration itself,432 which is precisely the conclusion to which this Tribunal has arrived in the course of its analysis.\n\n*See* January 2019 Declaration, p. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.\n\n*See* January 2019 Declaration, p. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9.\n\n**C**. **The Duty to Render An Enforceable Award**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal briefly addresses the issue of enforceability of its eventual Award, which the Parties have raised in their submissions. In so doing, the Tribunal emphasizes that this Section does not imply any conclusion that there necessarily will be any Award that requires enforcement, either against Italy (if Eskosol prevails on the remaining jurisdiction and merits issues, and obtains an award of either damages or costs), or by Italy (if Italy prevails on either jurisdiction or the merits, and obtains a costs award against Eskosol). By including this Section in the discussion, the Tribunal is not signaling anything about its current thinking on the remaining jurisdictional, liability, damages or costs issues in the case.\n\n229.\n\nRather, the Tribunal discusses enforcement only because the Parties have raised the issue as ostensibly relevant to the Tribunal's consideration of Italy's intra-EU jurisdictional objection. As noted in the summary of their positions, Italy contends that the Tribunal should \"refus[e] to exercise jurisdiction\" because any award it would issue would be unenforceable due to a lack of a \"functioning arbitration agreement,\" and a tribunal should not proceed where it is unable to \"discharge the essential mandate to produce an enforceable award.\"433 Eskosol deems the issue of enforceability to be \"pure speculation,\" and states that \"more fundamentally, questions of enforceability in certain jurisdictions should not impact a tribunal's jurisdictional analysis.\"434\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 122.\n\nEskosol PHB, \u00b6 99 & n. 152 (quoting *Vattenfall,* \u00b6\u00b6 230-231 (**CL-193**)).\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal of course acknowledges that the *Achmea* Judgment is binding in the European legal order, including on EU Member States (including Italy and Belgium) and in their respective judicial systems. The CJEU has not yet clarified whether it considers the reasoning in that Judgment to be applicable to the ECT, as a matter of EU law. If the CJEU ultimately finds the ECT distinguishable from the intra-EU BIT that it discussed in the *Achmea* Judgment - for example, because an ECT tribunal does not apply EU law to resolve the dispute, as this Tribunal has found in interpreting ECT Article 26(6) - then ultimately no enforcement issue may arise even within Europe.\n\n231.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal accepts that if the *Achmea* Judgment ultimately is determined to be applicable to the ECT, a court subject to the EU legal order could eventually question the enforceability under EU law of an ECT award rendered in an intra-EU case. In non-ICSID arbitrations, this might happen because the seat of the arbitration was in an EU Member State, but that possibility does not arise in ICSID cases such as this one, which are de-nationalized, *i.e.*, with no legal seat in any individual State. In ICSID cases, therefore, the concern about enforceability would arise principally in the scenario in which enforcement is sought in an EU Member State. Logically, that would not occur if Italy prevails: Eskosol would have no damages or cost award to enforce against Italy, and Italy may be unlikely to seek enforcement through the EU courts of any costs award against Eskosol that is not paid voluntarily, given its position that this Tribunal has no proper authority to render any award. Thus, it seems that any enforcement challenge in this case could arise only in a scenario under which Eskosol prevails on both jurisdiction and merits and obtains a damages award and/or a costs award against Italy. The Tribunal accepts that there could be a risk in that scenario that a European court might not grant enforcement of such an award.\n\n232.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts that Eskosol could face certain challenges in enforcing an award against Italy in a non-EU country, beyond the common problem that investors face of locating appropriate overseas assets that are not immune from execution. Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention obligates all Contracting States to \"recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.\" Nonetheless, non-EU courts may face certain pressure not to enforce an intra-EU investment arbitration award, based on the undertaking by Italy and others in the January 2019 Declaration that \"defending Member States *will request the courts, including in any third country*, which are to decide in proceedings relating to an intra-EU investment arbitration award *,* to set these awards aside or *not to enforce them* due to a lack of valid consent.\"435 Alternatively, if a non-EU court proceeds to enforce an award against Italy, the Commission eventually could deem any amounts collected to be unlawful State aid, and require Italy to seek recovery from Eskosol in an equivalent amount.\n\nJanuary 2019 Declaration, p. 4, \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). It remains to be seen how the courts of such third countries (*i.e.,* courts not seated in EU Member States) would react to such requests, which effectively ask them to accept the extraterritorial application of EU law at the enforcement stage of disputes that arbitral tribunals already have found not to be governed by EU law.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal expresses no views on the appropriateness of such potential developments as a matter of international law. It identifies these possibilities only to illustrate that while the scenarios are limited in which issues of enforcement of an award could arise, it accepts that there are at least some scenarios where enforcement could be challenging and/or create further residual disputes. Nonetheless, a tribunal has not rendered an \"unenforceable award\" simply because its award may prove challenging to enforce, or is capable of enforcement only in certain jurisdictions but not in others. The issue of a categorically \"unenforceable award\" would seem to arise only if an award is issued in violation of the mandatory rules of the arbitral seat. That possibility does not arise in ICSID cases such as this one.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal of course accepts that it is preferable to render an award that is easily enforceable. But the Tribunal does not agree with the proposition that it is restricted in its jurisdiction simply because there may be some limitations or complexities that arise at the enforcement stage. This Tribunal's jurisdiction is not determined by any national rules governing the enforceability of arbitral awards, but rather by the ICSID Convention and the ECT, neither of which subordinates jurisdiction to issues of enforcement.\n\n235.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Tribunal rejects Italy's contention that any award it may render (in either Party's favor) necessarily would be unenforceable. The Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction under the ECT, notwithstanding Italy's intra-EU jurisdictional objection, the *Achmea* Judgment, and the Termination Request based on the January 2019 Declaration. In these circumstances, a tribunal finding that it has jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the ECT should not decline to exercise that jurisdiction, simply because there are certain scenarios under which one or the other Party might face challenges in enforcement in certain jurisdictions, based on their national laws and/or their other treaty obligations. This Tribunal has a duty to exercise the jurisdiction it has found to exist, and will proceed to do so with respect to the issues remaining in this case.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n236.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(1) Italy's request of 4 February 2019 for an award declaring immediate termination of this arbitration, on the basis of the January 2019 Declaration of 22 EU Member States, is hereby denied;\n\n(2) Italy's related jurisdictional objection, based on the alleged inapplicability of the ECT to disputes between investors of one EU Member State and another EU Member State, is hereby denied;\n\n(3) The Tribunal will address separately in its Award the other jurisdictional and/or merits issues remaining in this case; and\n\n(4) Decisions regarding costs are deferred for resolution in the context of the forthcoming Award."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2020-09-04T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Table of Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n----------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| Blusun | Blusun S.A. |\n| *Blusun* case | *Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty (the \"ECT\"), to which the Italian Republic has been a party since 16 April 1998, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione (\"Eskosol\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Italian Republic, with an 80% shareholding by Blusun S.A. (\"Blusun\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Italian Republic (\"Italy\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute relates, in general terms, to certain changes that Italy enacted in 2011 to a program of incentives that it previously had put in place to encourage the building of additional photovoltaic (\"PV\") solar facilities in the country. The Claimant alleges that the investment it had made towards constructing a substantial PV project in Italy, in the expectation of qualifying for the incentive program while that program remained in effect, was rendered unviable as a result of the changes Italy enacted in 2011. The Claimant contends that Italy bears international responsibility under the ECT in these circumstances, which Italy rejects on the merits. Italy also contends that, as a threshold matter, the Claimant may not pursue its ECT claims because it already was in liquidation proceedings in Italy when it commenced this suit, and because its majority shareholder already had brought an ECT claim involving related events, although not on behalf of the Claimant or involving the Claimant\u2019s receiver in those proceedings. The Tribunal turns to these various jurisdictional and merits issues after addressing certain preliminary matters below.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 9 December 2015 from Eskosol against Italy (the \"Request for Arbitration\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 14 March 2016, the Claimant requested that, in the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn 15 March 2016, following appointment by the Claimant, ICSID notified the Parties that Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil had accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn 6 April 2016, following appointment by the Respondent, ICSID notified the Parties that Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy had accepted his appointment as arbitrator. Prof. Dupuy subsequently withdrew his acceptance on 25 June 2016, and was replaced by Prof. Brigitte Stern, who accepted her appointment on 1 August 2016.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 1 June 2016, the Claimant requested that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appoint the President in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(1). By letter of 21 June 2016, ICSID invited the Parties to consider a list of five candidates in view of finding a mutually acceptable President by ballot prior to commencing the requested Article 38 appointment. By letter of 25 June 2016, ICSID notified the Parties that, in light of Prof. Dupuy\u2019s resignation, the ballot procedure was suspended.\n\n12.\n\nBy email of 12 August 2016, the Claimant notified ICSID that the Parties had agreed to a new method for appointment of the President, specifically:\n\na. The co-arbitrators shall have until September 12 to agree on at least one name for presiding arbitrator (the \"President\") that would be acceptable to both of them. Each Party may have *ex parte* communications with the co-arbitrator it appointed solely for the purpose of discussing the appointment of the President.\n\nb. If the co-arbitrators cannot reach agreement by the above-mentioned deadline, either Party shall be free to resort to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention for the purpose of the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.\n\nc. If the co-arbitrators agree on one or more names, the Parties shall have two weeks as of the date on which such agreement is communicated to them to approve the proposed name or agree on a President if the co-arbitrators were able to agree on two or more names. If this two-week time-window expires with no such confirmation or agreement, as applicable, either Party will be free to resort to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention to appoint the President.\n\nd. While the above mechanism is underway, the Parties agree that ICSID should not resume the ballot procedure it suspended as a result of Prof. Dupuy withdrawing his acceptance to serve as Italy\u2019s co-arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 15 September 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that, pursuant to their agreed-upon method, it had contacted the candidate for President proposed by the co-arbitrators; however, the candidate did not have availability to accept his appointment.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 20 September 2016, the Claimant again requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council proceed to appoint the President under Article 38. By letter of 1 October 2016, ICSID transmitted a new ballot to the Parties.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 12 October 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that the ballot was successful, and that Ms. Jean Kalicki had been selected as President. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 5(2), ICSID proceeded to seek Ms. Kalicki\u2019s acceptance.\n\n16.\n\nOn 19 October 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Ms. Jean Kalicki, a national of the United States of America, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil, a national of Argentina and Portugal, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n18.\n\nOn 18 November 2016, the Respondent filed an objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), asking that the proceedings be dismissed for manifest lack of legal merit (the \"Rule 41(5) Objection\").\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 2 December 2016, by teleconference.\n\n20.\n\nOn 23 December 2016, the Claimant filed its response to the Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n21.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 4 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceedings would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed schedule for the proceedings, including a hearing in Paris on 8 February 2017, for oral arguments on the Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n22.\n\nOn 13 January 2017, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Claimant\u2019s response to the Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n23.\n\nOn 16 January 2017, the European Commission (the \"Commission\") filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (the \"Commission\u2019s Application\") pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37. By letter of 17 January 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations on the Commission\u2019s Application by 3 February 2017.\n\n24.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, the Respondent filed a Request for Provisional Measures under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) (the \"Request for Provisional Measures\"), seeking, *inter alia,* an order on security for costs. By letter of 23 January 2017, the Tribunal asked the Parties to revert by 30 January 2017, with a proposed schedule for briefings on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n25.\n\nOn 1 February 2017, the Claimant submitted its rejoinder to the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n26.\n\nOn 3 February 2017, as anticipated in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 17 January 2017, the Parties filed their respective observations on the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n27.\n\nA hearing on the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection was held in Paris on 8 February 2017.

On 15 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, providing the detailed reasoning for its decision in Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n38.\n\nAlso on 15 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, in which it provided the detailed reasoning for its decision in Procedural Order No. 2 on the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n39.\n\nOn 27 October 2017, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (the \"Counter-Memorial\") and supporting documentation, including the expert reports of Profs. Elena Maria Fumagalli and Stefano Pedrini (\"Fumagalli/Pedrini\"), and of Profs.

By letter of 19 December 2017, ICSID informed the Parties that the pre-hearing call would take place on 3 July 2018.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of 10 January 2018, the Tribunal noted that the Hearing originally had been scheduled for 24-28 September 2018, but asked the Parties whether the final day might be released, based on the small number of witnesses involved and in light of a possible conflict for one of the Tribunal members. By email of 11 January 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it had no objection to the proposed change. By email of 15 January 2018, the Claimant confirmed its agreement to the change.\n\n44.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits (the \"Reply\"), along with accompanying documentation, including the second witness statements of Messrs.

Should the Claimant wish to offer any brief points in sur-rebuttal, it was to do so by 1 March 2019, following which the Tribunal would treat the briefing on Respondent\u2019s Request for Termination as complete.\n\n77.\n\nBy letter of 16 February 2019, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Claimant\u2019s Response to the Request for Termination.\n\n78.\n\nBy letter of 1 March 2019, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent\u2019s 26 February 2019 submission.\n\n79.\n\nOn 7 May 2019, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Italy\u2019s Request for Immediate Termination and Italy\u2019s Jurisdictional Objection Based on Inapplicability of the Energy Charter Treaty to Intra-EU Disputes (the \"Decision on Termination\") in which it rejected Italy\u2019s requests.\n\n80.\n\nBy letter of 18 June 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings. By email of 21 June 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to respond to the Respondent\u2019s request by 1 July 2019.\n\n81.\n\nBy letter of 1 July 2019, the Claimant provided its comments on the Respondent\u2019s letter of 18 June 2019.\n\n82.\n\nBy email of 1 July 2019, the Office of Economic Interests of the Belgian Government forwarded the Centre a copy of the \"Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union.\" The Centre duly transmitted this document to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n83.\n\nBy email of 1 August 2019, Mr. Marco Pocci informed the Centre that he would continue to represent the Claimant from his new firm, Stephenson Harwood LLP, Hong Kong. He subsequently provided a power of attorney to that effect on 14 August 2019.\n\n84.\n\nBy email of 7 November 2019, the Respondent provided certain updates to its list of counsel for this proceeding.\n\n85.\n\nBy email of 6 December 2019, the Respondent requested leave to submit two additional legal authorities into the record, reflecting awards recently issued in arbitrations against Spain. By email of the same date, the Tribunal asked the Claimant for its comments on the Respondent\u2019s request. By letter of 15 December 2019, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request.

By email of the same date, the Tribunal asked the Claimant for its comments on the Respondent\u2019s request. By letter of 6 April 2020, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request. On 8 April 2020, the Tribunal denied the request \"in light of the stage of these proceedings, and in recognition in any event that the Tribunal resolves issues in this case based on its independent analysis, not based on the rulings of other tribunals.\"\n\n87.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, the Respondent requested leave to submit a new legal authority, reflecting a decision on annulment recently rendered in an ICSID arbitration brought by Blusun against Italy (the *\"Blusun* case\"),1 for which the earlier award already was part of the record. By email of the same date, the Tribunal asked the Claimant for its comments on the Respondent\u2019s request. By letter of 23 April 2020, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request. By letter of 18 May 2020, the Tribunal denied the request, \"on grounds of insufficient materiality and in light of the current stage of the proceedings.\"\n\n*Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3.\n\n88.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 25 August 2020.\n\n**III. ITALY\u2019S SUSPENSION REQUEST**\n-----------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nAs noted above, six weeks after the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Termination, which denied Italy\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on the inapplicability of the ECT to intra-EU disputes, Italy requested that the Tribunal nonetheless suspend these proceedings, on account of a matter then pending before the CJEU. Specifically, Italy mentioned two referral orders issued in May 2018 by the Italian Administrative Court of Lazio, asking the CJEU to consider whether the effects of the \"Spalma Incentivi Decree\" (Legislative Decree No. 91/2014) are contrary to certain provisions of EU law and/or to Article 10 of the ECT. Italy\u2019s contention was that a suspension of this arbitration would \"[g]iv[e] room to the [CJEU]\" to address \"the same ECT standards,\" and therefore promote consistency and legal certainty.2\n\nRespondent's letter of 18 June 2019.\n\n90.\n\nIn response, Eskosol noted *inter alia* that neither it, nor any of the special purpose vehicles (\"SPVs\") it owned, were party to the local proceedings that had given rise to the referred cases, nor did the Spalma Incentivi Decree have any relevance to this case. Eskosol also observed that this Tribunal \"is an international investment tribunal empanelled under a different legal order and pursuant to its own duties,\" as explained in the Decision on Termination, and therefore that a suspension of these proceedings would be unwarranted even apart from the lack of any overlap as to parties or measures at issue in the two cases.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal saw no basis for a suspension of its work. At the time the request was filed, the Tribunal had just issued a lengthy and detailed decision explaining its independent duty to decide this ECT dispute, regardless of the CJEU\u2019s role as the final arbiter of EU law. It is not clear why Italy waited until after that decision was rendered to inform the Tribunal that a year earlier, an Italian court apparently had referred questions about a different Italian measure to the CJEU, raising in that context certain issues regarding the ECT. Be that as it may, the pendency of such questions before the CJEU in no way altered the Tribunal\u2019s decision regarding its responsibility to proceed to resolve the issues entrusted to it. The Tribunal therefore determined to press ahead in its preparation of this Award, addressing the suspension request in the context of this Award rather than in yet another interim decision.\n\n**IV. PARTIES' CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s request for relief, as stated in its Post-Hearing Brief, is as follows:\n\nEskosol respectfully requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Declare that Italy has breached its obligations towards Eskosol\u2019s Investments and Eskosol itself under the ECT and/or international law;\n\n(ii) Declare that Italy\u2019s actions and omissions, as described in Eskosol\u2019s submissions, are unfair and inequitable; unreasonable; have failed to protect Eskosol\u2019s Investments; have failed to observe its obligations with Eskosol or Eskosol\u2019s Investments under the \"umbrella clause\" in the ECT; and have effectively expropriated Eskosol\u2019s Investments without prompt, adequate and effective compensation;\n\n(iii) Award Eskosol compensation for all damages, including loss of profits, caused by Italy\u2019s breaches of the ECT and/or international law towards Eskosol or Eskosol\u2019s Investments, in an amount of at least EUR 196,717,000 for its lost profits claim; and alternatively award Eskosol its sunk costs in an amount of at least EUR 37.9 million.\n\n(iv) Award Eskosol pre-award interest in an amount of at least EUR 18,825,558 as of 30 November 2018 for its lost profits claim, or alternatively award Eskosol pre-award interest in an amount of at least EUR 3,630,808 as of 30 November 2018 for its sunk cost damages.\n\n(v) Order Italy to pay to Eskosol all the costs of these proceedings, with interest on any relevant sum applied on the same basis as pre-award interest, including Eskosol\u2019s counsel fees and disbursements, the fees of the Tribunal and those of the Centre (such costs and interest calculations to be provided by the Claimant by way of Schedule of Costs, currently anticipated to be submitted on 11 January 2019);\n\n(vi) Award Eskosol post-award interest to be applied to the total amount ordered by the Tribunal and any portion thereof remaining unpaid by the Italy in the future, such interest to be compounded quarterly, and which rate of interest shall be based on the Italian Consumer Price Index (Nic), as published by The Italian National Institute of Statistics on the website: http://dati.istat.it/?lang=en# (Section: Prices / Nic - Monthly.3\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 218.\n\n93.\n\nItaly's request for relief, as expressed in its Memorial on Jurisdiction and in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (which in turn were incorporated by reference in the prayer for relief included in the Respondent's Rejoinder),4 is as follows:\n\nThe Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal, after having bifurcated the proceedings so that to judge exclusively on the objections on jurisdiction and admissibility:\n\n1. Rejects Eskosol's request for arbitration for lack of jurisdiction and/or inadmissibility;\n\n2. order the Claimant to pay all the costs of these proceedings.5\n\nResp. Rejoinder, \u00b6 386.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 291.\n\n94.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Respondent requested as follows:\n\n[S]hould the Tribunal uphold its own jurisdiction on the claim and consider it admissible, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n(a) declare, on the merits, that all the claims of the Claimant under Article 10(1) and [A]rticle 13 of the ECT are unfounded, for lack of a causal link between the challenged Respondent's conduct and the outcomes of the Project; and that, in any case, the Respondent's conduct does not constitute a violation of such rules.\n\nb) In this context, declare the requests for damages not supported by sufficient evidence of injury.\n\nc) In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to uphold one of the claims of the Claimant and award some form of compensation to the Claimant, declare the appropriateness of the calculations of the damages and the interest proposed by the Respondent.\n\nd) In any event, exclude from any amount of compensation the part of contributory fault attributable to the conduct of the Claimant, whose responsibility in the negative outcomes of the Project exceeds that in any way attributable to the Respondent.\n\ne) Ordering the Claimant to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian Republic in connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.6\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 435.\n\n95.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requested as follows:\n\nTogether with its reiterated plea to declare its behaviors not to violate any of the claimed provisions of the ECT, Respondent thus requests to be relieved from all costs and expenses of this procedure.7\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 181.\n\n**V. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes below certain relevant facts that are either agreed or that the Tribunal has found to be proven by the evidence. These include background facts regarding the regulatory framework applicable to solar energy projects in Italy, Eskosol\u2019s investment in Italy, and the measures Italy adopted in 2011 about which Eskosol complains in these proceedings. The Tribunal emphasizes nonetheless that it does not purport to set out all facts considered for purposes of this Award, and the absence of reference to particular facts or assertions, or to the evidence supporting any particular fact or assertion, should not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal has carefully considered all evidence and arguments submitted to it in the course of these proceedings.\n\n**A. The Regulatory Framework Prior to the Challenged Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nOn 27 September 2001, the European Commission issued Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market (the \"2001 Directive\").8 The purpose of the 2001 Directive was \"to promote an increase in the contribution of renewable energy sources of electricity production in the internal market for electricity and to create a basis for a future Community framework thereof.\"9 Among other things, this Directive set national indicative targets for each Member States' contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources to gross electricity consumption by 2010. Italy's indicative target under the Directive was 25%.10\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 1; 2001 Directive, C-12.\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 1.\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 3 and Annex.\n\n98.\n\nUnder the 2001 Directive, Member States were under an obligation periodically to publish a report setting national indicative targets for future consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources, taking into account the target set in the Directive, and outlining the measures taken or planned.11 On the basis of those Member State reports, the Commission in turn would assess to what extent the Member States had made progress towards achieving their national targets, and whether the national targets were compatible with a \"global indicative target\" of 12% of gross national energy consumption and with a 22.1% indicative share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in total Community electricity consumption by 2010.12 If the Commission's report concluded that the national indicative targets were likely to be inconsistent with the global indicative target for reasons that were \"unjustified and/or do not relate to new scientific evidence,\" the Commission was to propose \"national targets, including possible mandatory targets, in the appropriate form.\"13\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 3(2) and 3(3).\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 3(4).\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 3(4) *in fine*.\n\n99.\n\nThe 2001 Directive also required the Commission to evaluate mechanisms used in Member States to support producers of renewable energy, including \"assess[ing] the success, including cost-effectiveness, of the support systems... in promoting the consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with the national indicative targets referred to in Article 3(2).\"14 If necessary, the Commission was to propose a \"Community framework with regard to support schemes\" for renewable energy, with any such proposal to:\n\na. Contribute to the achievement of the national indicative targets;\n\nb. Be compatible with the principles of the internal electricity market;\n\nc. Take into account the characteristics of the different sources of renewable energy, together with the different technologies, and geographical differences;\n\nd. Promote the use of renewable energy sources in an effective way, and be simple and, at the same time, as efficient as possible, particularly in terms of cost;\n\ne. Include sufficient transitional periods for national support systems of at least seven years and maintain investor confidence.15\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 4(2).\n\n2001 Directive, C-12, Art. 4(2).\n\n100.\n\nOn 29 December 2003, Italy enacted Legislative Decree No. 387 on the implementation of the 2001 Directive.16 Article 7 of this legislative decree established that, within six months of its enactment,\n\nthe Minister of Production, in concert with the Minister of the Environment and Protection of Land and Sea, in agreement with the Unified Conference, will implement one or more decrees setting forth the criteria aimed at incentivizing the production of electric energy from solar sources.... without any cost to the State budget and observing current European Community Law....17\n\nThese criteria, in turn:\n\nsh[ould] establish the methodology to determine the amount of incentives. For energy produced by means of photovoltaic conversion from solar sources, [the criteria should] provide for a specific incentivising tariff, of a decreasing nature and having a duration that ensures a fair return on the investment and operating costs.18\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 1; Legislative Decree No. 387, CL-94.\n\nLegislative Decree No. 387, CL-94, Art. 7(1) and (2).\n\nLegislative Decree No. 387, CL-94, Art. 7(2)(d).\n\n101.\n\nOn 18 April 2005, Italy enacted Law No. 62, concerning the implementation by Italy of obligations arising from its EU membership. This law was aimed, *inter alia,* at completing the process of liberalization of the energy sector, in order to implement the EU Directive 2003/54/CE concerning common rules for the domestic electricity market. Among the principles to be followed in the implementation of EU policy was:\n\n[to] develop the use of renewable energy sources and co-generation through market instruments, providing a reorganization of the current legislative framework and a differentiation based on types of power plants and introducing incentivising mechanisms based on tender aimed at incentiviz[ing] the most advanced technologies which are far from trade competitiveness, remaining understood that all existing incentives for assimilated energies, at the end of the relevant deadline, will stop.19\n\nLaw No. 62, CL-95, Art. 15(f).\n\n102.\n\nOn 28 July 2005, Italy enacted a Ministerial Decree containing what is known as \"Conto Energia I,\" establishing incentives for investment in Italy\u2019s solar PV sector.20 Conto Energia I established a mechanism consisting of pre-determined incentivizing tariffs to be paid to PV plants having a nominal capacity lower than 100 kW, on the basis of the amount of electricity injected into the grid, with the understanding that the tariffs recognized by the decree would apply up to a \"[m]aximum aggregate limit,\" *i.e*., \"until the total aggregate power of all power plants that secure the same incentivizing tariffs reaches 100 MW.\"21 This aggregate limit on power plants entitled to secure the special tariffs was in turn related to the \"aggregate national target of capacity from photovoltaic plants to be installed [by] 2015,\" which was 300 MW.22 The level of the tariffs a *particular* new or renovated power plant would receive depended on its nominal capacity and on the date of the plant\u2019s application for the tariffs,23 with the understanding that the application was predicated on the plant\u2019s being \"connected to the grid\" and having \"entered into operation following 30 September 2005.\"24 For plants with a nominal capacity higher than 50 kW but lower than 100 kW, a rate of 0,490 euro/kWh was established for plants whose application was submitted during 2005 or 2006, while those plants whose applications were submitted after 2006 would have a tariff reduced by 2% for each year after 2006, \"it being understood that such incentivising tariff will be paid for twenty years.\"25\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 1; Conto Energia I, CL-96.\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 12(1).\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 11.\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Arts. 5 and 6.\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 4(1).\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 6(3).\n\n103.\n\nOn 6 February 2006, Italy adopted a decree amending Conto Energia I \"in light of the gained experience,\" and in particular \"the high interest for photovoltaic conversion\" which had led to applications already exceeding the maximum aggregate limit previously set at 100 MW.26 The amendment raised the national aggregate target of PV power to be installed by 2015 to 1,000 MW, and increased the \"aggregate limit of plants that can secure the incentivising tariffs\" under Conto Energia I from 100 MW to 500 MW.27\n\nDecree of 6 February 2006, CL-97.\n\nDecree of 6 February 2006, CL-97, Arts. 1, 2(1); Joint Chronology, p. 1.\n\n104.\n\nOn 19 February 2007, Italy enacted a Ministerial Decree containing \"Conto Energia II.\"28 This decree \"[c]onsider[ed] that the first results [of Conto Energia I and its amendment] have shown a remarkable managerial complexity of the system and an excessive imbalance in favour of the construction of large plants,\" and \"consider[ed] it appropriate to approve new measures aimed at correcting the incentive mechanism by introducing a simplified, stable and lasting scheme of access to the incentives.\"29 In order to qualify under Conto Energia II, PV plants must not already have benefited from the prior regime, \"must be connected to the grid,\" \"must have entered into operation,\" and must submit an application for the relevant incentive rate within 60 days of entry into operation, following which they would be notified of the approved tariffs.30\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 1; Conto Energia II, CL-98.\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98.\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Arts. 4(1), 4(3), 4(6), 4(7), 5(4), 5(5).\n\n105.\n\nThe electric power produced by PV plants built in compliance with the decree, and which came into operation between the effective date of Conto Energia II and 31 December 2008, \"has a right to an incentivising tariff... identified on the basis of [a] table\" set forth in the decree, \"valid for a period of twenty years from the date of entry into operation.\"31 As with Conto Energia I, the level of the tariffs again differed depending on when the plants entered into operation, with plants entering into operation before 31 December 2008 receiving a rate set out in Article 6(1), and those entering into operation during 2009 and 2010 receiving tariffs reduced by 2% for each calendar year after 2008.32\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 6(1).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 6(2).\n\n106.\n\nAs with Conto Energia I, Conto Energia II linked the incentive program to an objective of installing a \"national target for nominal cumulative photovoltaic power,\" now stated to be 3,000 MW by 2016.33 Conto Energia II also fixed a ceiling for the \"maximum cumulative electric power of all power plants that, in accordance with this decree, can obtain the incentivizing tariffs,\" with the ceiling now set at 1,200 MW.34 The decree also stated as follows:\n\nIn addition to the power plants that contribute to the achievement of cumulative electric power referred to in paragraph 1, all power plants entering into operation within fourteen months after the date, to be communicated by the operator on its website, on which the limit of power of 1,200 MW referred to in paragraph 1 is reached, have a right to the incentivizing tariffs mentioned in Article 6 and the bonus mentioned in Article 7. The above-mentioned period of fourteen months is extended to twenty-four months only for those plants owned by public entities.35\n\nIn order that the public be able to track the progress towards achieving both the national target and the incentive ceiling of 1,200 MW established under Conto Energia II, regular updates were to be published showing the accumulated power of plants that had entered into operation under Conto Energia I and II.36 Within six months of the 1,200 MW incentive ceiling being reached, a new decree would be adopted setting out further measures for achieving the national target.37\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 12.\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(1).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(2).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(3).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(4).\n\n107.\n\nIn general, Conto Energia II envisioned that further decrees would be issued every two years from 2009, setting out the tariffs for plants entering into operation for years after 2010, with those new tariff levels taking into account, *inter alia,* \"the price trends of energy products and components for photovoltaic plants,\" as well as the results of prior incentive programs, including the amount of PV energy brought online and the volume of incentives thus far extended.38 However, in the event that new decrees were not put in place, then the tariffs fixed by Conto Energia II for power plants coming into operation in 2010 \"shall continue to apply for the years beyond 2010.\"39\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Arts. 6(3), 14(1), 14(2).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 6(3).\n\n108.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (the \"Renewables Directive\"), which replaced the 2001 Directive and imposed mandatory targets on EU Member States for expansion of renewable energy by the year 2000.40 In Italy\u2019s case, the target imposed for 2020 was that 17% of gross final consumption of energy should be from renewable sources.41\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 1; Renewables Directive, C-23, Art. 3.\n\nRenewables Directive, C-23, Annex I.\n\n109.\n\nRecognizing that Member States had different renewable energy potentials and operated different support schemes to encourage the growth of renewable energy, the Renewables Directive provided that \"[f]or the proper functioning of national support schemes it is vital that Member States can control the effect and costs of their national support schemes according to their different potentials.\"42 Consequently, it established that \"[i]n order to achieve the targets... each Member State shall promote and encourage energy efficiency and energy savings.\"43 Moreover, the Renewables Directive provided that the national renewable energy action plans should \"tak[e] into account the effects of other policy measures relating to energy efficiency on final consumption of energy.\"44\n\nRenewables Directive, C-23, recital 25.\n\nRenewables Directive, C-23, Art. 3(1).\n\nRenewables Directive, C-23, Art. 4.\n\n110.\n\nOn 21 January 2010, Italy\u2019s Undersecretary for Economic Development, Mr. Stefano Saglia, reportedly declared that \"the Government\u2019s strategy on energy envisages a stable system of incentives that will lead to an increase in energy production from renewable sources.\"45 On 3-4 May 2010, Undersecretary Saglia attended the 2010 Verona PV Summit and reportedly declared that the Government intended \"to enact by the next meeting of the State-Regions Conference guidelines for the construction of renewable energy plants and the new photovoltaic energy bill, in order to give certainty to the entire sector.... The government wishes to confirm its commitment to the development of PV energy in Italy hoping to create investment opportunities, employment and development of a national pipeline, although foreign investments are certainly welcome.\"46 Reports on the same 2010 Summit noted that the new Conto Energia III was going to \"aim at a target of installed capacity of 3,000 MW in the next three years, but with the availability to take advantage of the tariffs for further 14 months after the target is achieved.\"47 Mr. Saglia also reportedly declared that the objective was to \"simplify, but also give [] certainty of rules.\"48\n\nFuture of Renewable Energy in Italy, luxenergia net, 21 January 2010, C-25.\n\nNational Press agencies Review of the 2010 Italian PV Summit, C-27.\n\nNational Press agencies Review of the 2010 Italian PV Summit, C-27.\n\nNational Press agencies Review of the 2010 Italian PV Summit, C-27.\n\n111.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, these and other statements by the Italian Government were intended to give assurances to investors in order to encourage investments in Italy\u2019s PV sector.49\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47; *see also New Conto Energia: expected news and GSE's point of view*, Enernew.it, 12 May 2010, C-28, and *Saglia: No Backward Steps.

In the Tribunal's view, nothing in the case turns on resolving this issue.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 7.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, pp. 7-8.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 8.\n\n113.\n\nThe National Action Plan further advised that \"[r]egarding the current situation, some corrections are expected to be introduced to the existing framework... in order to avoid a parallel increase in production and in incentive costs.\"54 These include a review of the FiT for solar plants \"in order to avoid excessive or insufficient remuneration,\" and a \"planned and progressive reduction of incentives (for example through adjustment according to the production costs of each technology,\" with \"advance planning of reductions in tariffs\" and \"application of new values only to those plants which come into operation at least one year after the introduction\" of the new values.55 More generally, the Plan described Italy\u2019s incentive scheme as follows:\n\nThe feed-in tariff is a support scheme which guarantees constant remuneration at current currency values for the electricity produced by plants for a set period of time (20 years for photovoltaic plants, 25 years for solar thermal plants). Moreover, the scheme is subject to regular adjustments which take into account the trends in the prices of energy products and components for photovoltaic plants as well as the results of monitoring and promoting technology used to create the plants, with the intention of limiting the medium- and long-term costs to the community. In any case, the incentive tariff paid when the plant becomes operation[al] remains fixed for the whole entitlement period.56\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 107.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 107.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 112.\n\n114.\n\nThe Plan referred to an upcoming new decree currently awaiting signatures *(i.e.,* the future Conto Energia III), which would set the national target at 8000 MW of PV capacity to be installed by 2020,57 and make various other changes, including a \"scheduled decrease\" of FiTs during 2011 and a further 6% annual reduction in 2012 and 20 1 3.58 The third FiT decree \"sets a maximum cap of 3000 MW for the capacity which is eligible for the incentive... Once these capacity limits have been reached, the tariff will nonetheless be provided for a further 14 months (24 months for public bodies).\"59 Access to these tariffs is \"allowed on the condition that the photovoltaic plants comply with the requirements of the third \u2018Feed-In Tariff,\"60 with the tariffs then \"paid for a period of 20 years starting from the date on which the plant becomes operational.\"61\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, pp. 108-109.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 112.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, pp. 114, 115.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 115.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, pp. 117-118.\n\n115.\n\nOn 7 July 2010, the Ministry of Economic Development issued a press release stating as follows:\n\nThe new Conto Energia for electricity produced by photovoltaic plants starting from 2011 operates a reduction of the incentives, which will have an impact on energy consumers. Thanks to the reduction on system charges, the electricity bills will be less expensive. The decree recognizes on energy produced a fixed and guaranteed incentive tariff for 20 years when the system enters into service in which anyone can secure (individuals, companies, public bodies, condominiums). For plants that will commence operations in 2012 and 2013 the incentives will be reduced by 6%. For subsequent years, it will be issued a new decree.62\n\nPress release of the Ministry of Economic Development, 12 July 2010, C-31.\n\n116.\n\nOn 6 August 2010, Italy issued a Ministerial Decree containing \"Conto Energia III,\" which was intended to apply to PV plants that entered into operation after 31 December 2010,63 and which would enter into effect upon its official publication. In the interim, however - on 13 August 2010 - Italy adopted Law No. 129 (the \"Salva Alcoa Act\"), \"providing for urgent measures on energy matters.\"64 The Salva Alcoa Act provided as follows:\n\nThe incentivising tariffs referred to in Article 6 of [Conto Energia II]... will be granted to producers that will complete the construction of the relevant power plants within the 31st of December 2010, and will communicate the completion of works to the relevant authorities and Gestore dei Servizi Elettrici - GSE S.p.A. within the above mentioned deadline, and whose plants enter into operation within the 30th of June 2011.65\n\nThe basic effect of the Salva Alcoa Act was to enable certain additional PV plants, which would be fully constructed by the end of 2010 but not yet entered into operation, to still qualify for the benefits of Conto Energia II - rather than the terms of the new Conto Energia III - so long as these plants entered into operation during the first six months of 2011.\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 2; Conto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 8(1).\n\nSalva Alcoa Act, C-32.\n\nSalva Alcoa Act, C-32; Joint Chronology, p 2.\n\n117.\n\nOn 24 August 2010, Conto Energia III entered into effect with its official publication.66 As indicated in the recitals, this Decree acknowledged the evolution of photovoltaic technology and the reduction of costs, and considered that in light of the basic tariff principle of \"fair remuneration of costs,\" tariff levels therefore should be progressively decreased:\n\nHaving considered the evolution of the photovoltaic technology achieved after the date of entry into force of ministerial decree 19 February 2007, and in particular the reduction of the costs of equipment and photovoltaic systems;\n\nDeemed to intervene in order to adjourn the incentivizing tariffs in light of the positive reduction of the cost of the photovoltaic technology, and in order to respect the principle of fair remuneration of costs, established by article 7 of the legislative decree no. 387 of 2003 and to encourage the innovation and further decrease of costs;\n\nDeemed that the above mentioned reduction of the incentivizing tariffs has to be implemented through a progressive decrease which, on the one hand, will result in a progressive alignment towards the current costs of technology and that, on the other, will maintain stability and certainty in the market...67\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99; Joint Chronology, p.2.\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, p. 2.\n\n118.\n\nThis new scheme in Conto Energia III provided that \"the national target of photovoltaic cumulative rated power to be installed is 8,000 MW by 2020,\"68 and \"[t]he capacity of cumulative electric power of photovoltaic power plants that can receive the incentive rates provided for in Title II [which covers Articles 7 to 10] of this decree is 3,000 MW.\"69 Progress towards this ceiling would be published and continually updated,70 and once the ceiling of 3,000 MW capacity of total incentivized power was reached, power plants that entered into operation within the next 14 months would still \"have the right to the incentivising tariffs.\"71\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(1).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(2).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(5).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(6); *see also* GSE, *Guide to Conto Energia III*, January 2011, C-34, \u00b6 3.\n\n119.\n\nConto Energia III provided that plants entering into operation during 2011 would have \"the right to\" tariffs set forth in a table which reflected a three-step decrease in rates during the course of that year; plants entering into operation in 2012 and 2013 would have \"the right to\" tariffs that were further reduced by 6% per year.72 A new decree would update rates for plants that entered into operation after 31 December 2013, failing which the gradual reduction established for plants entering into operation in 2012 and 2013 would continue to apply.73 As with Conto Energia II, once a plant entered into operation and thus became entitled to tariffs at a certain level, those tariffs were \"granted for a period of 20 years running from the day on which the power plant enters into operation.\"74\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 8(2).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 8(3).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 8(4). *See also* GSE, *Guide to Conto Energia III,* January 2011, C-34 (confirming the 20-year duration of the incentivizing tariff).\n\n120.\n\nConto Energia III included a number of requirements to qualify for the incentivizing tariffs, the most critical of which was that the relevant PV plants should enter into operation.75 This meant that the plants must be connected to the grid in accordance with the requirements set forth in Article 2(c) of the decree, by the deadlines established in the decree.76 To be granted the relevant incentivizing tariffs, the owner had to submit an application to the system operator within 90 days from entry into operation of the plant, with the operator having 120 days to decide on the application.77 If the incentivizing tariff was granted, then an incentivizing tariff agreement would be signed, specifying the tariff applicable to the relevant plant for 20 years.78\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 7(2).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 2(c).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 4(1) and (2).\n\n*See, e.g.*, Redacted Incentivising Tariff Agreement, 6 August 2010, C-36.\n\n**B. Eskosol\u2019s Investment**\n---------------------------\n\n121.\n\nOn 21 December 2009, Eskosol was established as an Italian \"societa a responsabilita limitata\" by Blusun, a Belgian company which then owned 50% of Eskosol\u2019s equity, and four Italian nationals (Messrs. Roberto Scognamiglio, Vittorio Sisto, Luigi Dante and Gilberto Braha), each of whom owned 12.5% of equity.79 Blusun, in turn, is owned by Mr. Jean-Pierre Lecorcier, a French national, and Mr. Michael Stein, a German national.\n\nEskosol Deed of Incorporation, Deed No. 224, Notary Repertory no. 1522, 21 December 2009, C-37.\n\n122.\n\nBetween 18 May and 26 July 2010, Eskosol acquired a 100% shareholding in 12 SPVs, which in turn held land rights for the construction of PV plants in Italy\u2019s Southern Apulia region.80 Its plan was to bring into operation a portfolio of 120 PV power plants with an aggregate power of 120 MW, with each of the plants having a nominal capacity of \"just below\" 1 MW. The 1 MW capacity cap was important to Eskosol\u2019s business plan, which sought to take advantage both of simplified permitting procedures and higher tariff levels available for small PV plants. At the same time, Eskosol\u2019s plan was to unite these 120 separate 1 MW plants into a single project for purposes of outside financing, with construction on the power plants beginning after this financing was arranged.\n\nTable Summarizing the acquisition of the 12 SPVs by Eskosol in mid-2010, C-87; Table Summarizing the Land Agreements between SPVs and landowners, C-92.\n\n123.\n\nAccording to Mr. Scognamiglio, the investors \"estimated that constructing these 120 power plants would require an investment in the region of \u20ac380 million to \u20ac400 million,\" and \"[t]he idea was to finance 80% of the costs of [the] project by way of bank loans (as was normal in the PV industry in Italy).\"81 This investment involved the construction of two medium- to high-voltage substations, which were necessary for the connection of the future plants to the electricity grid.82 The permit to build the substations had been obtained on 30 November 2009,83 a contract for the construction of the substations had been signed with Societa Interconnessioni Brindisi (\"SIB\") on 24 February 2010, and construction on the substations began in April 2010,84 shortly before the transactions in which Eskosol acquired its interest in the 12 SPVs.\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6 18.\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 16.\n\nAuthorisation for the Construction and Operation of Primary Cabins and Related Works from Province of Brindisi to Nico Energia, 30 November 2009, C-43; Joint Chronology, p. 1.\n\nJoint Chronology, p. 2; Magli I, \u00b6 26; Construction Contract between Societ\u00e0 Interconnessioni Brindisi Sr.l. and Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali S.p.A, 24 February 2010, C-42; Notification of Commencement of Work, 3 April 2010, C-46.\n\n124.\n\nMr. Scognamiglio has testified that Eskosol was established as an \"operating company in Italy that would acquire the 12 SPVs... and complete the power plants and other needed works.\"85 He stated that \"the plan was to buy the 12 SPVs at some point in 2010 and connect the power plants to the public electricity grid during 2011, to obtain the benefits of a new Conto Energia, that is, Conto Energia III.... More specifically, around September/October 2009, it was clear that Italy was going to issue new legislation,\" and that \"the specific provisions of Conto Energia III - eventually issued on 6 August 2010 - were generally known during the first months of 2010...\"86\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6 19.\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n125.\n\nMr. Scognamiglio testified that during 2010, including in May of that year, he met with Italy\u2019s Undersecretary for Economic Development, Mr. Stefano Saglia, \"to discuss the Eskosol Project.\" He stated that during these meetings, Undersecretary Saglia \"made it very clear to me that Italy was committed to keeping a stable environment for the investment in the solar PV sector and that it would not follow Spain\u2019s example. He also said to me that Eskosol should have no concerns in respect of its planned investment in Italy.\"87\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6 24.\n\n126.\n\nOn 10 July 2010, the law firm Watson, Farley & Williams produced at Eskosol\u2019s request a \"Due Diligence Report for the 121 MW Puglia Project,\" which advised on the regulatory framework applicable to PV plants in Italy under Conto Energia III as well as on the permits and authorizations thus far obtained by the 12 SPVs.88\n\nWatson, Farley & Williams: Preliminary Due Diligence Report relating to 121 MW Puglia Project, 23 July 2010, C-40, pp. 63-399.\n\n127.\n\nOn 25 November 2010, Eskosol\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to the GSE as follows:\n\nWith regard to the Project, we do believe - and we would like to receive your confirmation - that if the Project have [sic] the features described below and files a request to be granted the incentives under the so called Conto Energia between January and September 2011, you will accept the relevant request:\n\n- The relevant permits are completely legitimate and effective, and their effect has not been challenged or suspended; being understood that the construction in respect of the DIAs filed during the period August/September 2008 will be completed within 36 months from the relevant filing.\n\n- The relevant permit are [sic] not vitiated or suspended, and will not be suspended at the time application for incentives, by the Municipality through an action in self-defence (\"autotutela\") or by the competent administrative Court.\n\n- In addition, the power plants meet all the requirements (also technical), further to the construction permits, as envisaged to have access to by the Conto Energia.89\n\nLetter from Watson, Farley & Williams to GSE, 25 November 2010, C-94.\n\n128.\n\nOn 26 November 2010, Nico Energia signed, on behalf of itself and the other SPVs owned by Eskosol, two agreements with the operators of the electricity grid, ENEL and Terna-Rete Elettrica Nazionale S.p.A.

The letter, which was based on the assumption that the project would qualify for the incentivizing tariffs under Conto Energia III, clarified that:\n\nthis letter is not intended to be, and shall not constitute, an offer of financing or a commitment or undertaking by WestLB to provide or negotiate the terms of any credit facility in connection with the Project. Any commitment or undertaking by WestLB to arrange or provide a portion of the financing would be subject to, inter alia, satisfactory documentation, internal credit approval and satisfactory due diligence, and subject to such terms and conditions as WestLB may specify in its absolute discretion.96\n\nLetter to Mr. Stein from WestLB, 9 November 2010, C-53, pp. 2 and 6.\n\n133.\n\nOn 29 December 2010, Eskosol signed an engineering, construction and procurement contract with Siemens for the construction and commissioning of the Eskosol plants (the \"EPC Contract\").97 Eskosol was to procure the solar panels.98\n\nConstruction contract between Eskosol, S.p.A. and Siemens S.p.A., 29 December 2010, C-21; Joint Chronology, p. 3.\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6 43.\n\n134.\n\nThe EPC Contract provided that the Eskosol plants would be completed and become operable in three different stages: a first cluster of 30 MW entering into operation by 30 April 2011, a second cluster of 60 MW entering into operation by 31 August 2011, and a third cluster of 30 MW entering into operation by 15 November 2011.99 As noted in the EPC Contract, the purpose of these deadlines was for those PV plants to become eligible for the corresponding subsidies for the relevant periods.100 For that reason, the EPC Contract foresaw a penalty in the event that Eskosol was unable to secure the subsidies as a result of a delay by Siemens.101\n\nConstruction contract between Eskosol, S.p.A. and Siemens S.p.A., 29 December 2010, C-21, pp. 4-5; Joint Chronology, p. 3.\n\nConstruction contract between Eskosol, S.p.A. and Siemens S.p.A., 29 December 2010, C-21, p. 4.\n\nConstruction contract between Eskosol, S.p.A. and Siemens S.p.A., 29 December 2010, C-21, Art. 14.3.\n\n135.\n\nAccording to Mr. Magli, on 20 January 2011, Eskosol issued the first Notice to Proceed under the EPC Contract to Siemens.102 However, on the same day, Eskosol and Siemens signed a side letter to the EPC Contract, agreeing that:\n\nthe \"Notice to proceed\" for the First Group of Plants will be issued on January 25, 2011 and that the date for the down-payment and the Bank guarantee shall be extended to February 28, 2011.103\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 33; Joint Chronology, p. 3.

The Romani Decree**\n------------------------\n\n142.\n\nOn 30 November 2010, the Italian Council of Ministers issued the first draft of the decree on the implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE (later to be adopted with changes, and known as the \"Romani Decree\"). This draft noted among its \"[g]eneral principles\" an intent to \"reduc[e] the specific support costs charged to consumers,\" while \"safeguarding the investments made and the proportionality to the objectives... with the purpose of taking into account the market mechanisms and development of... technologies.\"111 The Claimant has not suggested, however, that the first draft of the decree contained major modifications to Conto Energia III.\n\nFirst Draft of Romani Decree, 30 November 2010, C-55; Joint Chronology, p. 2.\n\n143.\n\nOn 24 January 2011, the GSE published a Guide to Conto Energia III, with the purpose of \"providing all operators interested in realising photovoltaic power plants an easy and comprehensive reference work on the regulatory framework and on the procedure to have access to the incentivising tariff and in relation to relevant premiums, from the phase of application to the phase of payment of the incentives, as provided [by] the new ministerial decree 6/08/2010.\"112\n\nGSE, *Guide to Conto Energia III*, January 2011, C-34; Joint Chronology, p. 3.\n\n144.\n\nAt a Senate hearing held on 25 January 2011, the GSE noted that \"the growth of photovoltaic power plants has been too rapid.\"113 The GSE highlighted as follows:\n\n\u2022 The aggregate nominal capacity of plants realized, even if not connected to the grid, at the end of 2010 may have reached approx. 7,000 MW based on 200,000 plants;\n\n\u2022 Once into operation, the above mentioned plants will accrue burdens over the A3 fee equal to 3 billion euro, each year for 20 years;\n\n\u2022 To the end of 2011 it will be reached the target of 8,000 MW, nine years in arrears, set forth by the National Plan;\n\n\u2022 We suggest to consider a reduction on the capacity to be incentivised, by providing new targets for photovoltaic power plants for 2020 as well as a reduction of the incentivising tariffs for power plants which will enter into operation in next coming years, by reducing the incentives set forth by DM 6.8.2010 for the years 2012 and 2013.114\n\nGSE document entitled \"Hearing of 25/1/2011 \u2013 Comments of GSE on the Scheme of Law Decree Implementing Directive 2009/28/CE,\" 25 January 2011, C-82.\n\nGSE document entitled \"Hearing of 25/1/2011 \u2013 Comments of GSE on the Scheme of Law Decree Implementing Directive 2009/28/CE,\" 25 January 2011, C-82.\n\n145.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]he assertions made by GSE on 25 January 2011 before the Italian Senate (\u2018the 8,000 MW target that the National Action Plan... set for the year 2020 for photovoltaic plants, might be reached towards the end of 2011\u2019) and other Italian agencies on the \u2018excessive\u2019 growth of the PV sector, were incorrect. In fact, by February 2011, only approximately 3,730 MW of PV capacity under Conto Energia I, II and III had been connected to the grid.\"115 Indeed, according to another document from the GSE, the installed capacity of PV plants that entered into operation under Conto Energia III in 2011 was 1,552 MW.116\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 322.\n\nGSE, Table of In-Service Plants, 31 December 2014, C-59.\n\n146.\n\nHowever, according to the International Energy Agency, while the 2020 target of PV installed capacity under Conto Energia III was 8 GW *(i.e.,* 8,000 MW), the installed capacity by the end of 2011 reached about 13 GW.117\n\nInternational Energy Agency, \"Energy Policies of IEA countries, Italy, 2016 Review,\" R-47, pp. 86-87.\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that, in addition to the dramatic and rapid increase of PV installed capacity in 2011 (with a corresponding sharp increase in public spending on incentives), there was also a significant decrease in the costs associated with PV plants, resulting in unexpectedly high profitability levels for plant operators compared to those in earlier years.118 The Claimant has not disputed that the cost of PV technology significantly declined in this period.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 145-148; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 284-285 (citing Bacchiocchi).\n\n148.\n\nOn 7 February 2011, an Italian newspaper reported that the Italian Government had warned, in the report on market conditions sent to the Italian Parliament, of the risks of reaching the national photovoltaic target for 2020 years ahead of schedule in 2013, and the ensuing excessive costs to be borne by Italian consumers.119\n\n*5.7 billion to be paid by end consumers*, LaRepubblica.it, 7 February 2011, C-57 (noting that \"[t]here is a possible overcharging of 5.7 billion for end consumers, due to the incentivizing tariffs for renewables\").\n\n149.\n\nOn 17 February 2011, the Italian Senate approved a second draft of the decree on the implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE.120 The Claimant has not suggested that this second draft contained major changes regarding Conto Energia III.\n\nSecond Draft Romani Decree, C-61; *see also* Joint Chronology, p. 3.\n\n150.\n\nOn 28 February 2011, Italy\u2019s Minister for Economic Development, Mr. Paolo Romani, reportedly stated that the Government needed to stop the incentive-based mechanism for promoting renewable energies, because such incentives had \"cost the Italian people 20 billion euros between 2000 and 2010.\"121\n\n\"Romani Decree: The Law that Damages Investors of Renewable Energy in Italy,\" 28 February 2011, C-60a.\n\n151.\n\nOn the same date, the Italian Government published a third draft of the decree on the implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE.122 This draft included the following new provision:\n\nArticle 7 of legislative decree no. 387/03 will be in force until 1 January 2014; if the specific objective for the solar photovoltaic sector, set at 8,000 MW by 2020 as part of the National Action Plan referred in article 3, is reached ahead of time, according to article 3 of decree of economic development 6 August 2010, published on [sic] the Official Gazette no. 197 of 24 August 2010, the grant of incentives for further production of energy from solar PV sources shall be suspended until a decree issued by the Minister for Economic Development (to be made in consultation with the Minister for Environment and Sea Protection, after consulting the Unified Conference) sets out the new policy objectives and the relevant modalities, also in light of the provisions of article 33, paragraph 5-bis.

PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87, 100.\n\n153.\n\nIn any event, the third draft of the decree gave rise to significant criticism, including by one of the rapporteurs of EU Directive 28/2009/EC, Mr. Claude Turmes, who noted that this constituted a \"gift made to the nuclear lobby\" and that it was \"likely to cause the demise of hundreds of businesses and [the loss of] thousands of jobs, starting with the photovoltaic sector.\"126 Mr. Turmes suggested that the Government:\n\nmust eliminate the suspension of incentives in [Conto Energia III] when 8,000 MW are reached and guarantee the continuity of the market... A feasible option consists of adjusting the tariffs for [solar] photovoltaic [energy], and renewable [energy] in general, permanently (and not every 2 or 3 years) in light of different parameters such as Europe-wide costs trends of individual technologies, the price of kWh in respect of electricity and gas in respect of thermal.127\n\n\"Europe criticizes the decree that stops renewables,\" 2 March 2011, C-83a, p. 1.\n\n\"Europe criticizes the decree that stops renewables,\" 2 March 2011, C-83a, p. 1.\n\n154.\n\nOn 3 March 2011, the Italian Government adopted Legislative Decree No. 28 (also known as the \"Romani Decree\"), which was the final version of its decree on the implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE.128 The stated purpose of the Romani Decree was to \"define [] the tools, mechanisms, incentives and institutional, financial and legal framework, necessary to achieve the objectives until 2020 in matters of the overall share of energy from renewable sources.\"129 The Romani Decree noted that the production of renewable energy was to be encouraged on the basis of certain general criteria, including \"ensuring a fair return on investment and operating costs.\"130\n\nRomani Decree, C-75; Joint Chronology, p. 4.\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 1.\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 24(1), (2)(a).\n\n155.\n\nThe Romani Decree provided that the incentivizing tariff established by Conto Energia III would apply to the production of electricity generated by solar PV power plants that entered into operation by 31 May 2011.131 The electricity generated by solar PV plants that enter into operation *after* 31 May 2011 would be \"governed by a decree from the Minister for Economic Development to be adopted... [by] 30 April 2011.\"132 Without anticipating the precise conditions and levels of the tariffs to be offered under the new decree, the Romani Decree provided that they would be based upon the following principles:\n\na) determination of a maximum annual cumulative electric power from photovoltaic plants that can get the incentive rates;\n\nb) the incentivising tariff is to be determined taking into account the reduction in the costs of the technology and power plants and those to the incentives applied by other Members States of the European Union;\n\nc) determination of incentive rates and differentiated quotas according to the nature of the ground area;\n\nd) application of provisions of Article 7 of Legislative Decree of 29 December 2003 no. 387, if [they] are compatible with this paragraph.133\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(9).\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(10).\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(10).\n\n156.\n\nThus, the Romani Decree anticipated the early end of Conto Energia III and the coming into force instead of a new and different Conto Energia IV. It also eliminated the grace period that Conto Energia III had extended, for plants entering into operation within 14 months after a ceiling of 3,000 MW capacity of total incentivized power had been reached.\n\n157.\n\nSeparately, the Romani Decree set out new restrictions regarding the availability of incentivizing tariffs for PV plants built on small parcels of agricultural land, albeit subject to a transitional mechanism before the new rules would come into effect. Prior to the Romani Decree, PV plants were eligible for the tariffs so long as they occupied no more than 50% of the agricultural parcel of land on which they were built. In January of 2011, however, the GSE acknowledged the importance of \"protect[ing] agricultural land\" and \"preventing the excessive diffusion of large photovoltaic power stations which take up large areas of land,\" by directing incentives \"mostly to the photovoltaic plant built into roofs and structures.\"134 The ensuing Romani Decree therefore provided that beginning one year from its entry into force *(i.e.,* by 31 March 2012), tariffs under the forthcoming Conto IV regime would be available to plants built on agricultural land only if they occupied no more than 10% of the parcel available to the applicant and had capacity between 200 kW and 1 MW.135\n\nHearing of 25/1/2011 \u2013 Comments of GSE on the Scheme of Law Decree Implementing Directive 2009/28/CE, C-82(a), p. 1.\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Article 10 provides in relevant part as follows:  \n1. After one year from the date of entry into force of the present decree, renewable energy power plants will only be able to secure the State incentives if they meet the requirements and technical specifications set out in Annex 2. This is subject to any different starting date provided in Annex 2.  \n4. As of the date of entry into force of this decree, solar photovoltaic power plants with modules placed on land in agricultural areas, may access the State incentives provided that, in addition to the requirements set out in Annex 2:  \na) the nominal power of each power plant is not greater than 1 MW and, in respect of parcels of land that belong to the same owner, the power plants are situated at a distance of no less than two kilometres;  \nb) no more than 10 per cent of the surface of the agricultural parcel of land that is available to the applicant is earmarked for the construction of the power plants.\n\n158.\n\nThe Romani Decree was criticized by some associations and politicians. These included the Association of Foreign Banks in Italy, which noted that it \"place[d] many of the projects already financed and set to be disbursed at risk of default.\"136 It also included politicians from southern Italy, who noted that it \"endanger[ed] thousands of jobs\" and endangered investments underway.137\n\nGiorgio Lonardi, Energy and infrastructure, the wrath of foreign banks, La Repubblica, C-67.\n\n*Energy, renewable decree: The Region writes to Minister Romani*, Rinnovabili.it, 10 March 2011, C-69; *see also* Valerio Gualerzi, *Sit-in protests before the Ministry*, La Repubblica, 28 March 2011, C-64.\n\n159.\n\nThe Romani Decree was also criticized at the sessions held by the Italian Parliament on 14 and 15 March 2011, with some members of Parliament noting, *inter alia*, that the Romani Decree created a legal vacuum with respect to power plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, that the time needed for plants to connect to the grid ranged between 70 and 150 days, that some banks had announced the suspension of foreseen funding, and that some companies were at risk of losing their investments.138 Other members of the Italian Parliament noted, *inter alia:* (i) the risk that postponing the determination of the new incentivizing tariffs would lead to the blocking of investments underway; (ii) that the change undermined the rights of investors that had not factored in unexpected changes to the legal framework; (ii) that the Romani Decree \"change[d], retrospectively, the rules, setting tight deadlines which are incompatible with the realization of the capacity already authorized\"; and (iv) that given the absence of legislation for the period after 31 May 2011, those who had already obtained permits to realize and commission photovoltaic plants were at risk of not being able to have access to the credit market or to do so only under onerous terms.139\n\nDeputy D. Piffari's Motion 1-00594, 14 March 2011, C-70, which reads as follows:  \n[Pursuant to the Romani Decree] the \"rewards\" of Conto Energia III on photovoltaic [energy generation], which were meant to last at least from 2011 to 2013, will apply only to power plants connected to the grid by 31 May 2011. After that, the new incentives will apply. As a result, we are witnessing a sort of a legal vacuum that concerns all the power plants that connect to the grid after 31 May 2011; today, indeed, the time needed for a small PV power plant to connect [to the national grid] is around 70 working days, a period which is around 150 working days for more complex structures. It is completely unclear whether those who have approved projects, financed or in progress, would be able to be profitable after 31 May 2011. This is why it has been said that this cut is \"retroactive\" and unconstitutional; banks have already announced the suspension of foreseen funding and many companies have suddenly found themselves at risk of losing their investments, a circumstance that affects thousands of jobs and prevents the creation of new job opportunities (it has been reported today that, at present, in Italy, one of each three new jobs created relates to the green economy[\u2026]\n\nDeputy D.

The consequences of such amendments arouse my concern.\n\nWith Directive 2009/28/CE, the European Union has undertaken to increase the percentage of renewable energy, by establishing national mandatory fixed thresholds to be reached within 2020. Thanks to this strategy we could mitigate the climate change, improve the energy procurement and promote the industrial development.\n\nItaly is required to reach the quota of 17% of the gross final consumption of electricity from renewable energy within 2020. As set forth in National Action Plan for the renewable energy, in order to meet such requirement it is envisaged a significant increase of the internal production as well as the import from abroad, pursuant to the cooperation mechanism established by the above mentioned Directive. Therefore, it appears crucial that the Italian Government establishes a clear, stable and predictable incentives system, aimed at guaranteeing the development of renewables, without the risk that the necessary investment being postponed and become more expensive, preventing the achievement of the above mentioned target.\n\nIn the recent Communication \"Renewable Energy: Progressing towards the 2020 target,\" the Commission has highlighted the problems arising out from the recent reforms, recognizing the need to support the development of the technology and to provide incentives proportionate to the decreasing costs of the renewable investments. The amendments which modify the financial return of the existing projects may violate the national and European general principles and, above all, may jeopardize the stability of the investments in the industry, with potential repercussions on the economic upturn.\n\nTherefore I would like to kindly invite you to make all efforts in order to implement Directive 2009/28/CE in a stable and predictable manner and to be prudent when considering legislative measures that may have repercussions on the investments already made. My offices will be happy to further discuss the subject matter and assist you.140\n\nLetter from G\u00fcnther Oettinger, EU Commissioner for Energy, to Minister Romani, 15 April 2011, C-76.\n\n**E. Conto Energia IV**\n-----------------------\n\n161.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, the Italian Government enacted Decree of 5 May 2011 (also known as \"Conto Energia IV\").141\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100; Joint Chronology, p. 4.\n\n162.\n\nAccording to the recitals of the decree, in issuing Conto Energia IV, the Government took into consideration, *inter alia,* the following:\n\n... that the promotion of the production of electricity through photovoltaic plants entering into operation after the 31st of May 2011 has to be implemented by means of a gradual reduction of the tariffs which, on one hand, will tend to align the public aid with the relevant cost of the technology in line with the politics adopted by the main European states and, on the other, will ensure stability and certainty of the market;\n\n... that, based on the evolution of technology costs, the grid parity, that is the economic convenience of the energy generated through photovoltaic compared to other sources, will be met in [a] few years, which will result in incentives not [being] needed;\n\n... [that incentives should] allow[] investors and the industry to grow through the years, with a less impact on electricity bills;\n\n... that, on the basis of existing provisions for photovoltaic and data support on the investments made and in progress, the burden of the system\u2019s costs the electricity sector [sic] should reach, by 2011, around 3.5 billion annually.\"142\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, p. 3.\n\n163.\n\nOn this basis, Conto Energia IV established a gradual reduction of the incentivizing tariffs available for photovoltaic plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, with plants entering into operation in June 2011 receiving a higher incentive than those entering into operation in March 2012.143 The reduction in the tariffs offered under Conto Energia IV has been represented in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial as follows:144\n\n**Incentivising tariff depending on month when the power plant enters into operation Capacity of the power plant 200 < P \u2264 1000 kWh**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Jun \u201811** | **Jul \u201811** | **Aug \u201811** | **Sep \u201811** | **Oct \u201811** | **Nov \u201811** | **Dec \u201811** | **Jan-March \u201812** |\n|  | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** | **\u20ac/kWh** |\n| **III CE** | 0,303 | 0,303 | 0,303 | 0,266 | 0,266 | 0,266 | 0,266 | 0,251 |\n| **IV CE** | 0,291 | 0,276 | 0,263 | 0,245 | 0,233 | 0,210 | 0,189 | 0,172 |\n| **Difference** | 0,012 | 0,027 | 0.04 | 0,021 | 0,033 | 0,056 | 0,077 | 0,079 |\n\n**Percentage reduction (compared to Conto Energia III)**\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **%** 3.9 8.9 13.2 7.8 12.4 21 28.9 31.4 |\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Arts. 4 and 12(1), and Annex 5.\n\nMemorial, p. 62.\n\n164.\n\nConto Energia IV continued to provide that any particular tariff level, applicable to a given plant based on the date of its entry into operation, would remain constant for that plant for 20 years.145\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 12(2).\n\n165.\n\nArticle 6 of Conto Energia IV established the following conditions to access the incentivizing tariffs:\n\n2. The large plants that will enter into operations by August 31, 2011 will have directly access incentive rates, subject to the duty to notify GSE the entry into operation within 15 days after that date.\n\n3. For the years 2011 and 2012, large plants that do not fall in those referred to in paragraph 2 access to incentive rates if the following additional conditions occur:\n\na) the plant is listed in the register under Article 8, in such a position as to match the specific cost limits defined for each reference period referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2. The cost limit for 2011 includes the costs related to the incentives granted in favour of the large plants that have come into operation by 31 August 2011. If the whole cost of incentive for large plants that have come into operation by 31 August 2011 and of the cost of the incentives granted in favour of the plants enrolled in the register referred to in Article 8 for the year 2011 exceeds the limit estimated for the same period, the excess leads to a reduction by the same amount of the cost limit for the second half of 2012;\n\nb) the certification of completion of the plant is received by GSE within seven months after the date of publication of the list referred to in Article 8, paragraph 3; this period is extended to nine months a new mechanism for plants whose capacity exceeds 1 MW.\n\n4. In all cases, the applicable incentivizing tariff is the one in force on the date when the plant entered into operation.146\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 6(2)-(4).\n\n166.\n\nOne of the main changes under Conto Energia IV was that \"large plants\" (such as Eskosol\u2019s) had to enroll in a registry kept by the GSE. The registry established certain \"priority criteria,\" favoring plants that had entered into operation on the date of their application for registration, followed by those for which construction work was finished and those which had simply received certain authorizations. If the certificate of works completion for the plants listed in the GSE\u2019s registry was not produced by the applicable deadline, the registration of the relevant plant lapsed.147\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 8:  \n1. For the years 2011 and 2012 the person in charge of large plants must apply to [the] GSE for being listed in the appropriate register, sending the documentation described in Annex 3-A.  \n2. For 2011, applications must be received by GSE from 20 May to 30 June 2011. For the same year, the period for being listed in the register is re-opened, in case of additional availability under the cost limit referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2, from September 15 to September 30, 2011. For the first half of 2012, the period for registration is from 1st to 30th November 2011 and is subsequently reopened, in case of further availability within the cost limit referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2, from 1 to 31 January 2012. For the second half of 2012 the registration period goes from 1 to 28 February 2012 and is subsequently reopened, in case of further availability within the cost limit referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2 from 1 to 31 May 2012, in view of the provisions of article 6, paragraph 3, letter a) third sentence.  \n3. GSE prepares the list of the systems enrolled in the register and publishes it on its website within fifteen days after the closing date, according to the following priority criteria, to be applied in a hierarchical order: a) plants that have entered into operation on the submission date of the application for registration;  \nb) plants in which the construction works were finished on the submission date of the application for registration; in this case, subject to the provisions in Article 9;  \nc) priority based on the date of the relevant authorization;  \nd) lower nominal capacity;  \ne) priority based on the date of the application for being listed in the register.  \n4. If, for a plant enrolled in position to match the cost limits set out in Article 4, paragraph 2, the certificate of works completion has been not produced before the deadline specified in Article 6, paragraph 1, letter b), the registration of the same plant elapses. If, anyway, the plant is completed and qualifies, in a subsequent period, for the incentive rates in the manner and within the limits laid down in this decree, it is entitled to the rate in force on the date of entry into operation less 20%.\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that Italy\u2019s domestic courts have systematically rejected contentions that Conto Energia IV had retroactive effect. Italy cites, by way of example, the Administrative Court of Lazio, according to which \"access to the incentives is not tied to the mere possession of the administrative authorization to build the plant (which is just an essential prerequisite),\" but rather they are \"granted upon the commissioning of the plant..., when a plant is actually built and commissioned.\"148 In the court\u2019s view, the \"distinction anchored to the date of commissioning of the plant is adequately justified by the characteristics of the incentive system in question,\" which \"reflects the difference between the preparation phase of the intervention on the plant and the (very complex) phase of its commissioning.\"149\n\nThe Regional Administrative Court of Lazio Judgement, R-36, as translated at Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 158.\n\nThe Regional Administrative Court of Lazio Judgement, R-36, as translated at Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 158.\n\n168.\n\nOn 29 July 2011 and 16 September 2011, the GSE published a list of plants eligible to receive feed-in tariffs subject to the timely completion of their works. The lists included 113 of the Claimant\u2019s plants.150 Pursuant to Conto Energia IV, in order to qualify for the incentivizing tariffs, the plants had to be completed no later than seven months after the GSE\u2019s publication of the lists, *i.e.* by the end of February 2012.151\n\nMr. Stein's First Witness Statement in the *Blusun* proceedings, R-49, \u00b6 152; *see also* Reply, \u00b6 91; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 173.\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 6(3)(b).\n\n**F. The Eskosol Project after the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s witnesses, the uncertainty created by the Romani Decree and the reduction in tariffs resulting from Conto Energia IV, which made the Eskosol project \"economically unviable,\" prevented Eskosol from securing funding for the project,152 and thus proceeding with the Siemens EPC Contract under which construction essentially had been predicated on Eskosol\u2019s first obtaining outside funding.\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6\u00b6 58-60 (\"The enactment of the Romani Decree was a total disaster for Eskosol. It created absolute uncertainty in the market as and as a result prevented us from securing funding. In turn, this prevented us from making progress on the build out of Eskosol Project, as we had planned. \u2026 The reduction in the amount of the incentivising tariffs in Conto Energia IV, especially in respect of the tariffs for the end of 2011, was extremely detrimental to the viability of the Eskosol Project, particularly given the need to bear the significant costs of the whole infrastructure required for the Eskosol Project.\"); *see also* Magli I, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42 (\"In our case, the Romani Decree ultimately killed the Eskosol deal with the group of lenders led by Unicredit S.p.A., as they definitely pulled out, if I am not mistaken, at the end of March 2011. To make things even worse, on 5 May 2011, Conto Energia IV was published. This new decree significantly reduced the FiT in comparison to the ones applicable under Conto Energia III and, unlike Conto Energia II and III, did not contain a grace period provision protecting on-going projects. \u2026 So even if in theory we could secure funding \u2013 which was not possible as discussed above \u2013 the Eskosol Project became economically unviable.\").\n\n170.\n\nThe same witnesses also explained that Eskosol tried to save the project by offering subcontractors the possibility of building 60 power plants, with a total capacity of 60 MW, to be paid *after* the plants were connected to the grid. Eskosol\u2019s efforts were unsuccessful. According to Mr. Magli:\n\nEskosol approached local subcontractors to try to reach a deal so they would build these 60 power plants in exchange for payments after the power plants were connected to the main electricity grid. Due to the lack of trust in the system, no one, including subcontractors, was willing to risk their own money and thus no agreement was possible.153\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 43; *see also* Scognamiglio I, \u00b6 61.\n\n171.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Siemens sent a letter to Eskosol communicating its decision to terminate the EPC Contract. That letter read in relevant part as follows:\n\nReference is made to our communication dated March 07th 2011... under which... we were forced to suspend the EPC contract...\n\nUnfortunately we have to ascertain that, in the following months, it was not possible from your side to confirm us these financial and contractual conditions or alternatives that would ensure the sustainable implementation of the EPC contract.\n\nWe therefore inform you about our decision to terminate the EPC contract (suspended since last March) for reasons not attributable to us, as from the fifteenth day after receipt of this letter.154\n\nLetter from Siemens to Eskosol, 16 December 2011, C-80.\n\n172.\n\nSubsequently, the GSE sent a letter to Mr. Lecorcier communicating that \"the Responsible Party didn\u2019t submit, within the provided deadline, the completion certificate,\" and that \"this leads to the revocation of the enrollment to the \u2018large Plant\u2019 Register.\" According to the same letter from the GSE, 269 other plants with a capacity up to 1 MW had been connected to the grid and had qualified for the incentivizing tariffs.155\n\nGSE, Plants under Conto Energia IV - Revocation, R-37.\n\n173.\n\nOn 20 July 2012, Mr. Magli filed a request seeking the bankruptcy of Eskosol in respect of a debt of \u20ac2,082 million, mostly related to the sale of his rights in Nico Energia, J&P and Electra (3 of the 12 SPVs) to Eskosol.156\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 46.\n\n174.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, Eskosol\u2019s shareholders agreed to wind up the company, and Mr. Lecorcier was appointed as Eskosol\u2019s liquidator.157\n\nCopy of Eskosol's registration issued by the Italian Business Register, C-2.\n\n175.\n\nOn 12 November 2013, Eskosol was declared insolvent by a Brindisi court, which appointed Mr. Teodoro Contardi as receiver.158 According to the Claimant, Blusun and Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein thereafter failed to cooperate with Eskosol\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. They also commenced an ICSID claim against Italy under the ECT (the *Blusun* case) without informing either Mr. Contardi (Eskosol\u2019s receiver) or the judge supervising the Eskosol bankruptcy proceedings.159\n\nCopy of Eskosol's registration issued by the Italian Business Register, C-2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 187.\n\n176.\n\nIn 2014, the Brindisi court recognized that Eskosol had a total debt in the amount of \u20ac14,767,115.160 According to Dr. Stickel\u2019s Report, Eskosol\u2019s total sunk costs in relation to its planned PV projects in Italy are approximately \u20ac39.2 million.161\n\nList of Creditors for Eskosol's Bankruptcy Proceedings, Court of Brindisi, C-81.\n\nStickel I, \u00b6 23.\n\n**G. Eskosol\u2019s Business Plan**\n------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective positions differ with respect to the appropriateness of Eskosol\u2019s business plan.\n\n178.\n\nAccording to Italy, the failure of the Eskosol project was the result of Eskosol\u2019s own entrepreneurial choices, and in particular its decision to defer any construction work on PV plants until late in the project. By contrast, Italy notes that \"269 plants comparable to those of the Claimant [] (*i.e*., below 1 MW), entered the ranking and were indeed completed within that period.\"162\n\n*See, e.g.,* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 174; *see also id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 182-184; GSE, Plants under Conto Energia IV, Revocation, R-37; GSE, Overview table of results in different Conto Energia, R-38; GSE, Conto Energia- installed capacity in 2010, R-39.\n\n179.\n\nItaly states that \"Claimant\u2019s decision to prioritize the work on the grid, rather than proceeding at the time with the construction of the plants, was easily the single most important reason for missing out on the incentives available in 2010 and until June 2011.\"163 It also explains that \"the statement that without an STMD, no bank would finance the Project finds no correspondence in the clauses indicated by *Unicredit* 's Term Sheet, where the bank requires the STMD or the DIL for the grid connection deposited in July 2010.\"164 Eskosol chose to postpone the construction of the plants \"to the last possible moment, in order to cash in on the constantly decreasing cost of solar panels.\"165 Italy also notes that Eskosol signed the EPC Contract with Siemens before arranging its outside financing. In Italy\u2019s view, \"[t]he timeframe and the regulatory environment cannot be blamed for the Claimant\u2019s central failure to do the only indispensable thing: acquire enough funds to make the Project viable.\"166\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 123.\n\nResp.

The Respondent notes that Eskosol did not explain why its informal exchange with West LB was not explored further. Regarding Unicredit, Italy argues that \"[a]t a critical juncture, Claimant simply failed to convince the Unicredit Syndicate, its only possible partner, to inject urgently a substantial amount of money into a speculative project that, in several respects, was over-exposed to business risks, and that was just weeks away from entering disastrous financial troubles.\"169 In Italy\u2019s view, \"[i]nstitutional investors... were wary and careful to monitor profitability differentials existing across countries. As the margin of profit estimated in Italy was decreasing, it could not be expected that investors would rush to fund a massive project, like that of the Claimant, which was planned during the adjustment phase, and would become operational much later in time.\"170\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 189-196, 198 (citing Mr. Stein's written testimony in the *Blusun* case that \"Mr. Dante's initial idea was to sell the project to final investors who would buy a \u2018paper project' \u2026 Alternatively, the project could be sold to final takers after completion of the two substations \u2026 In any event Mr. Dante was hoping to sell the project to final investors rapidly. In the meantime, Mr. Dante was looking for debt investors to finance the project's development in the short- and medium-term.

First, it contends that \"[t]o qualify for incentives, PV plants have to be both built *and* operational; and the substations and cables had to be built and connected for Eskosol\u2019s PV plants to operate!\"171 Eskosol also suggests that ENEL required Eskosol to connect its PV plants to the public grid through two substations in the first place.172 Having the electrical infrastructure built and authorized made commercial sense, since obtaining the permits and building that infrastructure takes much longer, and is more risky, than building the PV power plants themselves.173 The Claimant contends that its business plan was also justified because \"Claimant saved money by waiting to construct the plants until after the connection work was complete. In 2010, the price of solar panels began to decrease *\u2018due to technological progress.* \u2019\"174 Eskosol further notes that \"obtaining the STMD from ENEL was a \u2018condition precedent\u2019 for securing the loan\" from Unicredit.175 Eskosol\u2019s experts also advance reasons related to savings on operation and maintenance, module warranty and module degradation, all of which would be achieved by building the PV plants only once the infrastructure was in place.176\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 33 (emphasis in original); *see also* Cl.

PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 103-108.\n\n183.\n\nEskosol also explains that the project needed to be large because there was no infrastructure in the region to connect the plants to the grid, and therefore the substations were required.178\n\nReply, \u00b6 42; Magli II, \u00b6\u00b6 7-16.\n\n184.\n\nEskosol contends that the project was financially viable under Conto Energia III, citing the term sheet Eskosol received from Unicredit on 31 January 2011.179 It notes that it hired sophisticated legal and financial consultants, and retained one of the top contractors for the final leg of the project.180 It also noted that receiving financing for 80% of the project was normal for solar PV projects,181 and that by the time it applied for construction financing \"it had eliminated nearly all regulatory risk because it had obtained nearly all necessary permits required for the infrastructure, the construction, and the connection of its PV plants.\"182 Eskosol argues that Professor Delfanti (Italy\u2019s expert) contradicted Italy\u2019s position that the PV plants should have been built in parallel with the substations, and that both Parties\u2019 experts actually agree that deferring construction of the PV plants until after completion of the substations and a significant portion of the medium voltage grid could not possibly have caused the collapse of the project.183\n\nReply, \u00b6 50.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.\n\nMagli II, \u00b6 21; Reply, \u00b6 49; Cl.

Lecorcier and Stein, had paid \u20ac16.9 million in cash to fund the project, and that its total sunk costs were much higher.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n--------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal has addressed issues of jurisdiction and admissibility in two prior decisions in this case: its 20 March 2017 Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, and its 7 May 2019 Decision on Termination. The latter decision conclusively resolved Italy\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on inapplicability of the ECT to intra-EU disputes. The former decision did not conclusively resolve any objections to jurisdiction or admissibility, but expressed certain preliminary views on several objections, in the course of rejecting Italy\u2019s request that the Tribunal dismiss Eskosol\u2019s claims for manifest lack of legal merit under ICSID Rule 41(5). Italy has now chosen to pursue some (but not all) of its original objections, and as to these, the Tribunal accepts that its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection does not resolve the issues, as that Decision necessarily was preliminary in nature. The Parties have since presented further arguments on the relevant objections, as was their procedural right. The Tribunal turns in this section to their principal contentions regarding the remaining jurisdictional and admissibility objections in this case.\n\n189.\n\nBy way of background, Eskosol states that it satisfies the jurisdictional requirements under both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the ECT. First, it contends that this proceeding concerns a legal dispute over Italy\u2019s violation in 2011 of its obligations under the ECT and international law.190 Second, it says that the dispute arises directly out of qualifying investments under both the ICSID Convention and Articles 1(5), 1(6) and 1(10) of the ECT, namely: (i) its land rights; (ii) its rights to the Eskosol grid; (iii) its 100% shareholding in the SPVs; (iv) the entitlement to use the substations; (v) its rights under the EPC Contract; (vi) its rights under the agreements for the acquisition of the SPVs; (vii) its officers\u2019 intellectual creations for the purposes of the Eskosol project; and (viii) its entitlement to permits, authorizations and licences obtained from different Italian authorities.191 Third, Eskosol states that it is a qualifying investor under Article 1(7) of the ECT, as the dispute involves an ICSID Member State (Italy) and a national of a juridical person \"as to which there is an agreement that it be treated as a national of another ICSID Contracting State.\" Indeed, Eskosol notes that, by signing the ECT, Italy and Belgium (which is the state of incorporation of Blusun, the holder of 80% of the Eskosol\u2019s shares) agreed in Article 26(7) as follows:\n\nAn Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party to the dispute on the date of the consent [to arbitration] and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purposes of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \u2018national of another Contracting State\u2019...192\n\nPursuant to this provision of the ECT, Eskosol contends that it should be treated as \"a national of another Contracting State\" for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICISD Convention.193\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 208.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 202-204, 209.\n\nECT, C-1, Art. 26(7).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 196, 213-216.\n\n190.\n\nFinally, Eskosol states that it sent a notice of dispute to the Italian Government in accordance with Article 26(2) of the ECT and consented to arbitration, pursuant to Article 26(3) and (4) of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, through its Request for Arbitration.194\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 218-220.\n\n191.\n\nIn the wake of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, Italy pursued two objections in addition to the intra-EU objection which the Tribunal subsequently denied. First, it advanced a jurisdictional objection based on Eskosol\u2019s alleged failure to satisfy the nationality requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT. Second, Italy advanced an admissibility objection grounded on *res judicata* and abuse of rights allegations, based on the relationship between Eskosol\u2019s claims in this case and those brought by Blusun and subsequently denied by the tribunal in the *Blusun* case. Italy\u2019s objections and Eskosol\u2019s position on these objections are summarized in turn below.\n\n**A. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nItaly argues that \"[i]n the context of ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal must be satisfied that its jurisdiction is granted both under the ICSID Convention and under the specific instrument of consent invoked by the investor.\"195 It contends that Eskosol did not satisfy, at the critical times, the requirements of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT, which in its view are cumulative and warrant separate analysis.196\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 18.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 16.\n\n**1. Nationality Requirement under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Italy\u2019s position**\n-----------------------\n\n193.\n\nItaly argues that investors that have the nationality of the host State at the time of registration of their Request for Arbitration do not fall under the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae.* Exceptionally, Article 25(2)(b) provides for the possibility that domestic companies may bring a claim against their host State, but stipulates two requirements: that \"the investor must be controlled *\u2018by foreign investors\u2019* of the home State, and the Parties must have agreed that such control qualifies the investor for protection as if it had foreign nationality.\"197 Italy notes that Article 25 does not specify the point in time at which foreign control must exist, but contends that it should be interpreted to require foreign control at the date of consent to arbitration, which is considered to be the date of registration by ICSID of the arbitration request.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 23.\n\n194.\n\nItaly accepts that Article 26(7) of the ECT records an agreement between Italy and Belgium regarding foreign control, but contends as a matter of fact that \"there was no foreign control of the Claimant at the relevant time.\"198\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 24.\n\n195.\n\nIn its view, \"[i]f the parties indicated foreign control as a qualifying element, a different - and looser - notion, like foreign shareholding, will not suffice. Exceptions cannot be interpreted extensively.\"199 To this effect, Italy invokes the treaty interpretive principles of Article 31 of the VCLT, which it says \"includes taking into account the default treaty regime from which the exceptions derogate. The default rule (foreign citizenship is required) cannot be waived by extending the exception (foreign control) beyond its literal meaning.\"200 According to Italy, \"[s]ince Article 26(7) of the ECT requires *\u2018foreign control,,* anything short of objective foreign control will not suffice to trigger the circumstances envisaged by the ECT parties.\" Indeed, Italy argues that \"even if the agreement between the ECT parties were to require anything less stringent than actual foreign control, it could not override the specific requirement in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID.... The element of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) must be factually demonstrated.\"201\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 30.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 30.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32; *see also id*., \u00b6 33.\n\n196.\n\nItaly considers that:\n\n[t]he idea of formal control is a contradiction in terms in the framework of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID because the \u2018foreign control\u2019 element operates precisely to pierce the veil of formal nationality and reach for the reality of effective control. In short, non-objective control is just not control.202\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32.\n\n197.\n\nIn support of its proposition on the need for an objective test for foreign control, Italy relies on the decisions rendered in *National Gas*,203*TSA*,204 and *Vacuum Salt.205* Italy rejects Eskosol\u2019s attempt to distinguish the *TSA* decision on the factual grounds that the claimant in that case had been controlled by an Argentinian national *all* the time. Italy says that its reliance on *TSA* is to the effect that \"foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) ICSID must be real and material, objectively identifiable and not merely presumed. This point is one on the law, about the nature of control (actual rather than presumed),\" and the point cannot be defeated simply by distinguishing *TSA* on the facts, \"on an aspect that did not concern the nature of foreign control.\"206\n\n*National Gas S.A.E. v.

Schreuer to the effect that: \"The existence of foreign control is a complex question requiring the examination of several factors such as equity participation, voting rights and management. In order to obtain a reliable picture, all these aspects must be looked at in connection. There is no simple mathematical formula based upon shareholding or votes alone.\" (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 49, citing C. Schreuer, 12 ICSID REV.- FOR. INV'T L. J. 59, 79-80 (1997), 126).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 26.\n\n198.\n\nItaly argues that Eskosol misunderstood its statement that \"Article 26(7) ECT... is open-ended\" and \"thus contains no agreement, and can raise no presumption of foreign control, with respect to Eskosol or any other specific company.\"207 Italy says that the emphasis in this quote should be on the words \"with respect to Eskosol or any other specific company,\" given that \"[i]n most... cases cited in support of the \u2018ownership implies control\u2019 theory, the agreement required under Article 25(2)(b) ICSID was contained in a contract, to which the individual company that was to be treated as foreign was a party. Of course, in such circumstances, the presumption that the host State had considered the control structure of the contracting company is reasonable, and its express willingness to treat that company as foreign enjoys a presumption of validity.\"208\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\n199.\n\nAccording to Italy, \"[t]he issue in the present case is whether Italy and Belgium, and all the parties to the ECT, have agreed at all to consider any foreign-owned company to be controlled by foreign investors by reason of foreign shareholding alone. This is clearly not the case, and there are no presumptions to rebut. The simple question is whether, in the case at hand, the local company could demonstrate... having been controlled by foreign investors at the critical time.

In support of this, Italy relies on *Vattenfall, LETCO* and *AES,* three cases where the investors appear to have provided evidence of actual control in addition to their shareholding in the relevant companies.210 Indeed, Italy says that \"there can be ownership without control.\"211\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42 (citing *Vattenfall AB et al. v.

In fact, according to Italy, the ECT imposed a stricter requirement on foreign control *ratione temporis*.214 Italy notes that, at the time of consent,\n\n[t]he existence of the present proceedings, after all, is the result of the non-foreign controller (the court-appointed receiver) acting in name of the Claimant *(recte:* of its creditors) to launch arbitration. At some earlier point, the Belgian shareholders did indeed possess and exercise control over the Claimant. Indeed, one of the last relevant managerial decisions taken by them was precisely to consciously relinquish control, by triggering bankruptcy proceedings that led to receivership.215\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 53.\n\n203.\n\nItaly rejects Eskosol\u2019s argument that Blusun\u2019s shareholding would be devoid of meaning or content, if Eskosol were to be deemed no longer controlled by Blusun simply by virtue of its entry into receivership. In Italy\u2019s view, Blusun \"is simply devoid of control.\"216 It also rejects Eskosol\u2019s suggestion that Blusun still could recover control in the future. First, apart from the likelihood of this scenario, \"it cannot be argued that hypothetical acquisition of control triggers the application of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID.\"217 Second, the notion that Blusun could regain control if sufficient funds could be secured by winning this proceeding to satisfy Eskosol\u2019s creditors is \"conditional on a finding of jurisdiction, which in turn depends on a prior determination of foreign control.

In its view, should Eskosol have wished to bring a claim against Italy, it could have done so since 2011, \"and for a long while thereafter, until the Italian court\u2019s order in November 2013.\"224\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 64.\n\n206.\n\nRegarding the critical time to assess the existence of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Italy notes that Article 25 \"does not contain an express indication of when foreign control of legal persons must exist for the Centre to have jurisdiction by virtue of a special agreement of the parties.\"225 In its view, \"[s]ince Article 25(2)(b) ICSID provides the Contracting States with the power to extend the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, by replacing the criterion of nationality with that of control, it stands to reason that the lack of the replaced criterion (foreign nationality) and the replacement criterion (foreign control) be ascertained at the same critical moment, that is, the time of consent to arbitration.\"226 Eskosol \"lost foreign control long before it consented to arbitrate its ECT-related grievances. There is no issue of losing previously acquired arbitration rights.\"227\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 66.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 67. Italy relies for this proposition on *Vacuum Salt*, RL-10, n. 6; Christoph Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009), RL-17, p. 329; and *TSA*, RL-30, \u00b6 160.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 72.\n\n207.\n\nItaly also rejects the argument that a potential injustice could arise if there were a requirement of continuous nationality, for example in an expropriation case, as the investor would be deprived of its right to ICSID arbitration by the very act which it wishes to challenge in such a proceeding.228 In its view, no such scenario arises here, for three reasons. First, the Tribunal only must require continuous ownership and control up through the time of consent, but not afterwards. Second, this is not an expropriation case. And third, approximately two and a half years passed after the challenged measures, before Eskosol lost its foreign control.229\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 74, citing *Vacuum Salt*, RL-10, n. 6.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 74-77.\n\n**b. Eskosol\u2019s position**\n-------------------------\n\n208.\n\nEskosol rejects Italy\u2019s argument that it no longer was subject to foreign control as required under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. First, Eskosol notes that Article 25(2)(b) \"is silent on the definition and timing of \u2018foreign control\u2019 and does not even suggest, much less establish, when \u2018foreign control\u2019 must exist.\"230 It argues that \"nowhere does the ICSID Convention provide support to the conclusion that \u2018foreign control\u2019 over the domestic corporate claimant must exist at the time of consent.\"231\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 7.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 7.\n\n209.\n\nEskosol also notes that none of the cases Italy cites deal with the agreement on foreign control contained in the ECT. Indeed, none of these cases were faced \"with a decision on the issue of whether the reference to foreign control in Article 25(2)(b) could only mean that such foreign control must exist at the time of consent to arbitration.\"232 It argues, *inter alia,* that the *TSA* decision \"is distinguishable because it was accepted that \u2018at all possible critical dates (the request of arbitration, the consent to jurisdiction, the origin of the dispute), [claimant] was controlled by an Argentinian national.\u2019\"233 Eskosol also refers to the Tribunal\u2019s statement in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection that \"there is no temporal element... simply a reference to the parties\u2019 agreement.\"234 In its view, it is this agreement that should guide the Tribunal, and when the requirement set forth in Article 26(7) of the ECT is satisfied, \"which Eskosol does, then Article 25(2) [of the ICSID Convention] is also satisfied.\"235 Eskosol criticizes Italy for \"mak[ing] the assertion that \u2018Article 26(7) ECT... is open-ended\u2019 and \u2018thus contains no agreement, and can raise no presumption of foreign control, with respect to Eskosol or any other specific company.\u2019\"236\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 8.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 8, citing *TSA,* RL-30, \u00b6 159.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation. \u00b6 7.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 9.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 11.\n\n210.\n\nAccording to Eskosol, in placing emphasis on the importance of the objective component of Article 25(2)(b), Italy ignores the Tribunal\u2019s finding that:\n\nThe term \"foreign control\" is not defined in the ICSID Convention, and tribunals have concluded that the absence of a definition represented a deliberate choice by the drafters. In reliance on the consensual nature of the Convention, they preferred giving the parties the greatest latitude to define these terms themselves, provided that the criteria agreed upon by the parties are reasonable and not totally inconsistent with the purposes of the Convention.237\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13 (quoting Decision on Rule 41(5) Application, \u00b6 101, and citing the decision in *Aguas del Tunari S.A. v.

Second, Eskosol states that \"[w]hat is sudden is that merely invoking bankruptcy proceedings to block Eskosol\u2019s jurisdiction here would allow Italy to effectively flip a switch turning off access to arbitration for \u2018an otherwise qualified foreign-owned entity.\u2019\"240 This result is particularly problematic when the cause of the bankruptcy is alleged to be the State\u2019s breach of the ECT.241 In this regard, Eskosol notes that Italy failed to address the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion, in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, as follows:\n\n[T]his would mean that even in demonstrated cases where State conduct is partially or wholly responsible for the financial straits that led to the bankruptcy (as Eskosol alleges in this case), the State could avoid scrutiny of its acts by virtue of their own consequences, simply by invoking the predictable reality that local bankruptcy proceedings always will be supervised by local courts.242\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 17.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 18.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 18 (quoting Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 106).\n\n**2. The Notion of \"Foreign Control\" under the ECT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Italy\u2019s position**\n-----------------------\n\n213.\n\nItaly asserts that the ECT imposes two requirements with respect to foreign control: (i) it requires actual foreign control, as opposed to mere ownership; and (ii) foreign control must exist at the moment when the dispute arose.\n\n214.\n\nFor the proposition that the ECT requires actual foreign control, Italy relies on the ECT\u2019s Understanding with respect Article 1(6):\n\nFor greater clarity as to whether an Investment made in the Area of one Contracting Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Investor of any other Contracting Party, control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. In any such examination, all relevant factors should be considered, including the Investor\u2019s\n\n(a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment;\n\n(b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment; and\n\n(c) ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or any other managing body.243\n\nECT, C-1, p. 70.\n\n215.\n\nAccording to Italy, this Understanding makes it clear that the ECT requires \"control in fact,\" looking at the \"actual circumstances\" of the case and consideration of \"all relevant factors.\"244 Italy states that Eskosol has failed to prove these elements to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.245\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 87.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 88-90.\n\n216.\n\nItaly agrees with Eskosol that the expression \"before a dispute arises\" has to be read as meaning \"immediately before\" or \"as of the moment\" a dispute arises. The Parties disagree, however, on the meaning of \"dispute.\"246 Italy relies on the ICJ jurisprudence for the proposition that a dispute is \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties\" and that \"[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other.\"247\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 94 (citing *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v.

ICSID arbitration was available to Eskosol for more than 30 months from March/May 2011 to November 2013, and Eskosol \"failed to exercise its right to consent to arbitration\" before it \"voluntarily triggered receivership and knowingly ceased to be controlled by Belgian investors.\"251\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 110 (citing Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 106).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 110.\n\n219.\n\nItaly asserts that Eskosol tries \"to replace the time of the challenged measures (in 2011) with the time in which the dispute arose.\" Italy notes that Eskosol \"strung together five passages of its pleadings in which, allegedly, it had signaled the notion that the dispute had arisen since 2011.\"252 In Italy\u2019s view, by stating that \"[t]he Italian Government was aware, or should have known, that these measures were opposed by and would injure solar energy investors, such as Eskosol,\" Eskosol shows \"the impossibility to satisfy the legal test for a dispute to exist.\"253 Indeed, Italy notes that \"[t]here is no reference to any legal claim in this sentence, whilst the existence of a legal claim amenable to a specific source of obligations (which must subsequently meet with positive opposition *by the entity whose responsibility is invoked*) is the quintessential element of a dispute.\"254\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 33.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 38.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 38 (emphasis in the original).\n\n220.\n\nItaly also criticizes Eskosol\u2019s reliance on *De Levi,* arguing that, contrary to Eskosol\u2019s suggestion, paragraph 149 of this award *\"did not* address the critical time of the dispute, but the critical time of the breach.\" Indeed, Italy points out that the footnote to the same paragraph says that \"the moment when an alleged breach of the treaty occurs is not necessarily the same as the moment in which the dispute arises,\"255 and that at paragraph 167 of the same award the tribunal held that \"a breach or violation does not become a \u2018dispute\u2019 until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.\"256 In Italy\u2019s view, \"[t]he putative exchange between Mr. Scognamiglio and Government officials in which the latter allegedly reassured the former about his planned investments, in 2010, cannot... amount to evidence of a legal dispute relating to an ECT-claim about the 2011 measures, met with positive opposition by the Respondent.\"257 Italy thus concludes that the dispute crystallized \"only at the time of the trigger letter in 2015.\"258\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 40 (emphasis in original), (citing *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi & Gremcitel SA v.

Eskosol\u2019s position**\n-------------------------\n\n221.\n\nEskosol argues that \"[it] was under foreign control before this dispute arose; and it remains under foreign control for purposes of ECT Article 26(7) in any event because, *inter alia*, it remains majority-owned by Blusun and its foreign controlled status cannot be stripped away by the bankruptcy which Italy\u2019s own misconduct proximately caused.\"259\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 20.\n\n222.\n\nEskosol says that Italy\u2019s argument that the ECT\u2019s Understanding *\"rule[s] out* all possible attempts to argue that \u2018foreign control\u2019 exists simply by reason of foreign majority shareholding\" ignores the following finding by the Tribunal in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection:\n\nThe factors listed in the Understanding are each in a sense structural, deriving either from the distribution of company shares or from the distribution of powers regarding management, operation, and selection of board members, which generally are reflected in a company\u2019s foundational documents. *While the company's economic fortunes may wax and wane,* and certain exigencies may require a resort to bankruptcy protection, *there is no suggestion in the ECT Understanding that the possibility of financial misfortune was expected to outweigh a more structural analysis of control*, and render an entity *ipso facto* locally controlled, simply because of the necessary supervision of a bankruptcy court.260\n\nItaly having acknowledged that \"the Belgian shareholders did indeed possess and exercise control over the Claimant,\" Eskosol says that \"Italy\u2019s argument continues to be that \u2018financial misfortune\u2019 somehow \u2018outweigh[s] a more structural analysis of control.\u2019 Not so.

Eskosol says that the dispute arose in 2011, and that its position is consistent with a number of statements in the Request for Arbitration and Eskosol\u2019s pleadings on Italy\u2019s application under Rule 41(5).262 Eskosol relies on *Maffezini* for the proposition that \"there is a difference between a dispute and a claim\" and that \"[w]hile a dispute may have emerged, it does not necessarily have to coincide with the presentation of a formal claim.\"263 In its view, it was in 2011 that Eskosol and Italy became positively opposed: the Government \"was aware, or should have known, that these measures were opposed by and would injure solar energy investors, such as Eskosol, after their enactment.\"264 Eskosol also refers to public debate at the time of the adoption of the Romani Decree, including the statements made by financial institutions, Italian politicians and the European Commission.265 Eskosol also refers to the concerns raised by Mr. Scognamiglio with Italian Government officials.266\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 29.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27 (quoting *Maffezini*, RL-45, \u00b6 96).\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 29.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 29-32 (relying on *De Levi,* CL-24, \u00b6 149, as follows: \"In the Tribunal's view, *the critical date is the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure*, even when the measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started years earlier.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThere is no dispute that as of the dates of the two State measures that are alleged to have violated Italy\u2019s ECT obligations (the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, in March and May 2011 respectively), Eskosol was controlled in all relevant respects by Blusun - a Belgian company that owned 80% of its shares, and that exercised the powers of control attendant to such dominant shareholding under its foundational documents. There is equally no dispute that as of the later date when Eskosol\u2019s ECT claim was registered by ICSID (22 December 2015), Eskosol was in liquidation proceedings in Italy, having been declared insolvent on 12 November 2013. As would be expected, those proceedings were supervised by an Italian court (in Brindisi), and the receiver the court appointed was an Italian national, Mr. Contardi. The question is whether the latter circumstances have jurisdictional significance for this case.\n\n225.\n\nAs the Tribunal discussed in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, both the ICSID Convention and the ECT establish that, in appropriate circumstances, a company incorporated in the host State can be accepted as qualified to bring a claim against the host State, notwithstanding the normal requirement that a claimant must have the nationality of another Contracting State. As to what those circumstances are, both texts must be separately examined and satisfied.\n\n226.\n\nBeginning with the ICSID Convention, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes jurisdiction over \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of *another* Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre\" (emphasis added). This principle of diversity of nationality is subject to a specific exception reflected in Article 25(2)(b), which includes within the definition of a foreign national \"any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\" The reference to a party agreement in turn requires reference to Article 26(7) of the ECT, which (as the Tribunal previously noted)267 sets forth two requirements, separated by the conjunctive \"and,\" for a host State company to be treated as a qualified foreign national for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. First, such company must have the host State nationality \"on the date of [its] consent in writing\" to ICSID, a requirement that was clearly satisfied by virtue of Eskosol\u2019s Italian corporate nationality. Second and independently, the company must be \"controlled by\" investors of another Contracting Party \"before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises.\"\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 87.\n\n227.\n\nThe Parties have debated extensively both the legal issue of *when* foreign control must be established to satisfy the ECT and ICSID Convention tests, and the factual issue of *whether* those tests were satisfied on the operative date(s).268 Beginning with the temporal issue, this involves two distinct questions. First, for purposes of the ECT Article 26(7) foreign control inquiry, when can the relevant \"dispute\" between Eskosol and Italy be said to have arisen -the date of the challenged measures, the date Eskosol first objected to those measures, or the date when ICSID registered Eskosol\u2019s ECT claim? Second, for purposes of the ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b) inquiry, does the reference to party agreement on foreign control make the ECT critical date dispositive, or does the ICSID Convention impose an additional requirement that, whatever the control finding may be as of the date the dispute arose, foreign control must subsist at least through the date of consent to ICSID arbitration *(i.e.,* registration of the claim)?\n\nIt is uncontroversial that the tests of both the ECT and ICSID must be satisfied, because Article 25(3)(b) of the ICSID Convention has both subjective and objective components. The subjective component looks to whether there has been an agreement to treat a local entity as a national of another Contracting State; the objective component requires a tribunal to satisfy itself that control indeed was exercised by a national of the Contracting State, because \"parties do not have unlimited discretion to define as foreign-controlled an entity that objectively is not, or that objectively is controlled only by nationals of a non-Contracting State.\" Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 90 (citing authorities). Nonetheless, as the Tribunal previously noted, \"[g]iven the importance of the parties' stated intentions as reflected in their agreement, \u2026 a tribunal should not conclude that foreign control objectively is lacking unless there are unusual circumstances that preclude deference to their agreement to \u2018treat[]' an entity as so controlled. These circumstances would require a finding that the criteria agreed by the parties are simply unreasonable, or that application of such criteria would result in an outcome that contravenes the underlying purposes of the ICSID Convention.\" *Id.* (citing authorities).\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal offered certain preliminary observations on these questions in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, based on the limited (expedited) briefing the Parties then had submitted. Among other things, the Tribunal agreed with Professor Schreuer that Article 25(2)(b)\u2019s wording \"is not without ambiguity\" regarding the operative date for foreign control,269 because the Article references the date of consent to arbitration as critical to the nationality determination, but does not contain an express temporal element with reference to foreign control, simply a reference to the parties\u2019 agreement.270 The Tribunal also noted that \"either interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) could have significant implications for cases involving facts different from this one,\"271 for example: (i) in cases involving corporate transactions between the date the dispute arose and the date of consent, where an exclusive focus on control as of the date of the dispute could \"facilitate the buying or selling of ICSID claims... to new owners... with no element of foreign control whatsoever\" by the date a claim is brought,272 or (ii) in cases involving State nationalization or forced sales to third parties, where an exclusive focus on control as of the date of consent could enable States \"to shield them[selves] from challenge for wrongdoing that directly precipitated the loss of control.\"273 Finally, the Tribunal observed that because \"all interpretations of arguably ambiguous treaty language have potential doctrinal consequences for future cases that should not be lightly ignored,\" this \"counsels for caution\" in how tribunals proceed with such exercises, \"particularly where the issue presented appears... to be one of first impression.\"274\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 93 (quoting Christoph Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed. 2009), RL-17, p. 329).\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 94-95.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 96.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 96.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 97.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 98.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal reaffirms its previously expressed view about the importance of prudence, in not reaching out to decide unsettled points of law that are not strictly necessary to the resolution of the issues before it. In this case, that proves to be the situation regarding the temporal question, because the Tribunal ultimately concludes that the answer to that question is not necessary to resolve Italy\u2019s jurisdictional objection. *Arguendo,* if Eskosol were correct that the only critical date for foreign control purposes was the date of the challenged State measures, then it is undisputed that Eskosol was controlled by a Belgian company on the relevant dates, and therefore that it has jurisdiction to proceed with its claim. Correspondingly, if (*arguendo*) Italy were correct that the key date for foreign control purposes was the date ICSID registered Eskosol\u2019s claim, the Tribunal concludes that Eskosol\u2019s status as being in liquidation proceedings does not suffice to make either the Italian receiver or the Italian court the controlling entity, for purposes of determining jurisdiction to bring claims under the ECT and the ICSID Convention, and Italy has not pointed to any indicia of change in control other than the pendency of those proceedings.\n\n230.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted in its prior decision, the term \"foreign control\" is not defined in the ICSID Convention, and tribunals have concluded that the absence of a definition represented a deliberate choice by the drafters.275 \"In reliance on the consensual nature of the Convention, they preferred giving the parties the greatest latitude to define these terms themselves, provided that the criteria agreed upon by the parties are reasonable and not totally inconsistent with the purposes of the Convention.\"276 In this case, the ECT text does not define control for purposes of determining whether a local company is \"controlled\" by a foreign investor pursuant to Article 26(7), but the term \"controlled\" also was used in the definition of \"Investment\" in Article 1(6), which refers to \"every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor..\" The Tribunal considers it appropriate to construe the term consistently across these two provisions. The Tribunal therefore gives due weight to the \"Understanding\" adopted by the ECT parties with respect to Article 1(6).277 Moreover, the Tribunal sees no reason, for purposes of an ICSID Convention \"objective\" control analysis, to adopt different criteria than those on which the ECT parties subjectively agreed. The stated criteria are \"reasonable\" and in no way threaten to \"permit parties to use the Convention for purposes for which it was clearly not intended.\"278\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 101.\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001, RL-8 (\"*Autopista*\"), \u00b6 97.\n\nFinal Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, Section IV (\"Understandings\"), CL-192, \u00b6 3 (\"With respect to Article 1(6)\").\n\n*Vacuum Salt*, RL-10, \u00b6 37 (quoting Aron Broches for the proposition that with respect to agreements on foreign control, \"any stipulation \u2026 based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted\" and jurisdiction should be declined \"only if \u2026 to do so would permit parties to use the Convention for purposes for which it was clearly not intended\").\n\n231.\n\nAccording to the joint Understanding adopted by the ECT parties, \"control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation.\"279 The Tribunal accepts that \"control in fact\" is not to be decided exclusively by reference to equity shareholding, although \"equity interest\" is included within the first of three \"relevant factors\" identified in the Understanding\u2019s non-exhaustive list of items to consider in determining control (\"financial interest, including equity interest\"). With respect to this factor, there has been no allegation of any intervening transaction that altered Eskosol\u2019s shareholding structure, after the date of the challenged measures and before ICSID\u2019s registration of its claim. To the contrary, the Parties agree that Blusun, a Belgian company, continues to own 80% of the Eskosol shares. Moreover, the Parties have not made any significant arguments based on the identity of Eskosol\u2019s creditors, to try to establish control-in-fact based on the allocation of any \"financial interest\" other than \"equity interest.\"\n\nFinal Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, Section IV (\"Understandings\"), CL-192, \u00b6 3.\n\n232.\n\nThe Understanding identifies as the second and third \"relevant factors\" the \"ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment,\" and the \"ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or any other managing body.\" The Tribunal previously noted that these factors are to a large degree \"structural,\" deriving from the distribution of power that generally would be reflected in a company\u2019s foundational documents.280 There has been no allegation of any change in Eskosol\u2019s foundational documents, for example regarding the distribution of voting power, the appointment of Board members and officers, and the authority of officers to take decisions on their own versus referring them to the Board.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 107.\n\n233.\n\nRather, as the Tribunal previously observed, \"Italy\u2019s sole objection is that the bankruptcy filing itself displaced whatever mechanisms of control existed previously, so that from that date on, \u2018control in fact\u2019 of Eskosol manifestly resided in the hands only of its receiver and the supervising bankruptcy court. This is said to follow from Italian law regarding the powers of a bankruptcy receiver and court.\"281 But the ECT parties no doubt were aware of the possibility that the \"economic fortunes [of a local company] may wax and wane, and certain exigencies may require a resort to bankruptcy protection.\"282 And yet, as the Tribunal previously observed, \"there is no suggestion in the ECT Understanding that the possibility of financial misfortune was expected to outweigh a more structural analysis of control, and render an entity *ipso facto* locally controlled, simply because of the necessary supervision of a bankruptcy court.\"283\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 104.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 107.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 107.\n\n234.\n\nIt is of course true that a bankruptcy receiver exercises significant influence over the management of a company\u2019s *assets*, under the supervision of a bankruptcy court, while the company remains in bankruptcy proceedings. However, the receiver does not exercise such authority *on his own behalf*, making him the ultimate party-in-interest to the company\u2019s fate,284 and therefore supporting some conclusion that it is *his* nationality that properly should govern for ECT and ICSID Convention purposes. Rather, the receiver acts essentially as a trustee or agent - not as a principal - on behalf of those with dominant legal and financial interests in the company *(e.g.,* shareholders and priority creditors). The trustee administers the company in the shareholders\u2019 interests, not in his own. That agency moreover is a temporary power, not a permanent one, and it remains in place only so long as the entity remains in bankruptcy. That status could come to an end for various reasons, including (but not limited to) the possibility that an insolvent entity prevails in a legal claim and collects sufficient recovery to settle its outstanding debts.\n\n*Cf.* *Guardian Fiduciary*, RL-35, \u00b6\u00b6 131, 134, 137 (finding that control was held by the beneficial owner and not the immediate legal owner of a trust, where the legal owner merely held the shares on behalf of beneficial owner).\n\n235.\n\nIn this case, Italy concedes that Eskosol\u2019s shareholders \"retained certain rights, even after the opening of the receivership procedure... such as the right to reach an agreement with the creditors.\"285 In other words, if they had the means and saw a business reason for doing so, the shareholders could choose to infuse additional capital into the company, to enable it to emerge from bankruptcy and resume operations. However likely or unlikely that might be on the facts, the shareholders\u2019 legal right to make such choices, if considered warranted and feasible from a business perspective, is an important indicia of their *residual* control, even if they have been forced by extenuating circumstances to place the company into temporary administration.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 54.\n\n236.\n\nFinally, the determination of control for purposes of the ECT or ICSID must be conducted in a way that is consistent with, and not in violation of, the object and purpose of those treaties. Without entering into a broad exploration of the treaties\u2019 object and purpose, it is fair to say that at least one such purpose includes facilitating the neutral resolution of disputes between investors and States, regarding those States\u2019 treatment of investments made within their borders. It is a reality that a substantial number of foreign investments are made through local companies incorporated in host States, and that reality was reflected *inter alia* in both Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would be inconsistent with that understanding, and with the object and purpose of the treaties, to divest local companies that indisputably were owned by foreign investors from the ability to pursue potentially well-founded ECT claims, simply because of a subsequent collapse in the company\u2019s economic fortunes, particularly in circumstances where it is alleged that the collapse was attributable to the State\u2019s own wrongful conduct. Yet that would be the inevitable outcome of Italy\u2019s suggestion that any bankruptcy filing by the local company should be deemed to transfer effective control either to the receiver or to the host State\u2019s courts, since almost by definition both the receiver and the local judges overseeing his work will be nationals of the host State.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal stated as much in its Decision on the Rule 41(5) Objection, as follows:\n\nWhile the Convention\u2019s drafters may have been content largely to defer to the parties to reach their own agreements regarding the facts of control, such agreements must be consistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention, including the protection in appropriate cases of foreign investment. It would not be consistent with the underlying purposes of the Convention to render an otherwise qualified foreign-owned entity suddenly ineligible to access its protections, simply because the entity\u2019s liabilities eventually overtake its assets enough to justify (at least temporary) supervision of its activities to protect the rights of creditors. Among other things, this would mean that even in demonstrated cases where State conduct is partially or wholly responsible for the financial straits that led to the bankruptcy (as Eskosol alleges in this case), the State could avoid scrutiny of its acts by virtue of their own consequences, simply by invoking the predictable reality that local bankruptcy proceedings always will be supervised by local courts. But even in less dramatic situations, such as where the bankruptcy is attributable largely to factors other than State action, there still is no logic to divesting the entity of its otherwise applicable right to seek redress for grievances against the State - particularly when doing so might enable it to reverse its financial fortunes enough to emerge from bankruptcy. There is certainly nothing in the ICSID Convention to suggest that implementation of the foreign control requirement for jurisdiction was intended to depend on the financial fortunes or misfortunes of the local entity.286\n\nDecision on the Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 106.\n\n238.\n\nSince that time, the Tribunal has seen nothing in the subsequent briefing to change its view. Accordingly, Italy\u2019s jurisdictional objection on the basis of lack of foreign control is denied.\n\n**B. Admissibility Objection**\n------------------------------\n\n**1.** ***Res Judicata*** **and Duplication of Proceedings Generally**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Italy\u2019s position**\n-----------------------\n\n239.\n\nItaly contends that, even if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction, Eskosol\u2019s claims are inadmissible \"as contrary to *res judicata* and any other principle barring duplication of proceedings.\"287\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n\n240.\n\nAccording to Italy, the dispute in this arbitration is substantially the same as the one in the *Blusun* case. In that case: (i) the dispute concerned Blusun\u2019s investments in Italy through Eskosol; (ii) Blusun challenged various measures, including the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV; and (iii) as Eskosol admitted in its application under Rule 41(5) in the *Blusun* case, its claims in this arbitration \"arise from the same factual matrix and adverse measures that [we]re at issue in the *Blusun* arbitration.\"288\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 119; *see also* \u00b6\u00b6 121-128.\n\n241.\n\nItaly also argues that the following conclusions of the *Blusun* tribunal, which \"are related to lack of causation, would have equally applied in the event that the claimants had based their grievances on other standards under the ECT\":\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have not discharged the onus of proof of establishing that the Italian state\u2019s measures were the operative cause of the Puglia Project\u2019s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued dependence on project financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended. That being so, the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project would fail in any event.289\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130 (quoting *Blusun, S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian* Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Award, 27 December 2016, \u00b6 394, RL-56 (\"*Blusun*\")).\n\n242.\n\nIn Italy\u2019s view, the *Blusun* case and this proceeding concern \"identical qualified interests.\" Italy notes the Tribunal\u2019s observation, in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, that \"there may be certain circumstances in which a foreign shareholder and the local company in which it holds shares have *such identical interests* that it would be abusive to permit arbitration of a given dispute by one after the other already has concluded an arbitration over the same dispute.\" The Tribunal indicated this could apply in a situation where \"a first case were brought by the 100% shareholders of a local company and thereafter a second case was attempted by the local company that they wholly owned.\"290\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 132-133 (quoting Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167) (emphasis added).\n\n243.\n\nItaly says that the Tribunal \"did not imply that the above principle of identity of interest could only apply in case of wholly owned companies, since it indicates this situation as only one example of \u2018identical interests\u2019.\"291 According to Italy,\n\nif the parent company places itself in the position of being made substantively whole for the alleged harm, then the harm caused by the contested remedies is remedied. Blusun claimants requested damages for the failure of the Project, and included in the losses all harms also claimed by Eskosol.292\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 134.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 134.\n\n244.\n\nItaly challenges Eskosol\u2019s arguments that: (i) Blusun failed to coordinate with Eskosol in pursuing its claims in the *Blusun* case, which in turn would indicate that it did not intend to share with Eskosol any proceeds of those claims; and (ii) Blusun did not represent Eskosol\u2019s significant interests.293\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 135.\n\n245.\n\nRegarding the first aspect of Eskosol\u2019s argument, Italy contends as follows: (i) Eskosol waited more than two years after the decision was taken to liquidate the company to initiate this proceeding, so it is difficult to argue that it bears no responsibility for Blusun proceeding with an arbitration first, and there is no evidence that Blusun impeded Eskosol from starting an arbitration earlier; (ii) the statement that Blusun had no intention of sharing any proceeds of its arbitration with Eskosol is purely speculative; and (iii) Eskosol\u2019s minority shareholders, whose interests allegedly were not represented in the *Blusun* case, in any event were not qualified investors under the ECT who would be entitled to the benefit of ECT protections.294\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 136-138, 143 (relying on *Orascom TMT Investments S.a.r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, RL-57 (\"*Orascom*\"), \u00b6\u00b6 488, 495) (quotation omitted)).\n\n246.\n\nRegarding the second aspect of Eskosol\u2019s argument, Italy says that any harm to Eskosol from the challenged measures could have been fully repaired in the *Blusun* case, as Blusun\u2019s claimed losses in that proceeding included Eskosol\u2019s equity value as well as the capital injected into the project.295\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 144 (quoting *Orascom*, RL-57, \u00b6 497 (quotation omitted)).\n\n247.\n\nItaly says that in the present circumstances, where Eskosol\u2019s \"minority shareholders would not be entitled by any means to ECT or ICSID protection as nationals of Italy... there is no discrimination, nor deprivation of fundamental rights of anyone legitimate to claim them under the relevant foreign investment protection regime.\"296\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 145.\n\n248.\n\nItaly further rejects Eskosol\u2019s argument that not allowing it to seek redress would jeopardize its creditors. Aside from noting that the creditors are also Italian, Italy says that \"they did not directly claim for damages suffered by their own investments and consequently they have no right to recover under this arbitration.\"297 It adds that the claims of Eskosol\u2019s minority shareholders and its creditors could be pursued in the Italian courts under Italian law, but not through an ECT arbitration.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 147.\n\n**b. Eskosol\u2019s position**\n-------------------------\n\n249.\n\nEskosol rejects Italy\u2019s *res judicata* objection. It explains that *res judicata* requires identity of (i) parties, (ii) cause, and (iii) object, none of which has been established here.298\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 35-49.\n\n250.\n\nFirst, Eskosol argues that Blusun and Eskosol \"are plainly not identical.\"299 It also says that \"the finding of an identity of interest depends on the circumstances at issue\" and notes that, in its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application under Rule 41(5), \"[t]his Tribunal found that in the present circumstances there was no identity of interests between the Eskosol and Blusun claimants.\"300 Eskosol rejects the application of a possible exception based on 100% ownership by the foreign shareholder, because \"Eskosol is not wholly owned by Blusun, and... [a]t no point was Eskosol\u2019s independent corporate personality abused.\"301 Nor has Eskosol acted in concert with Blusun. Indeed, it was Blusun that rejected consolidation of its ICSID case with the case Eskosol later initiated, which is why Eskosol filed an application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) to be heard as a non-disputing party in the *Blusun* case, \"precisely to ensure that Blusun did not claim the damages that only Eskosol could rightfully claim.\"302 Blusun opposed that application as well.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 36.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 38.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 39.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 40.\n\n251.\n\nAs to the delay in filing the Request for Arbitration, Eskosol explains that its timing was \"reasonable under the circumstances,\" as it sent Italy a trigger letter on 20 July 2015, *i.e.,* less than a year after it went into receivership, and it needed that time to discuss the claim with the receiver, retain counsel, obtain third party funding and seek approval from the creditors\u2019 committee and the judge in charge of receivership.303\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 43.\n\n252.\n\nEskosol finally claims that neither of the other two prongs of the triple identity test are met in this proceeding. First, the two proceedings do not concern the same contested measures. While Eskosol\u2019s claims concern two contested measures (the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, both issued in 2011), the *Blusun* claim was based on a number of events that spanned a five-year period (2008-2012), just two of which were the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV.304 Also, Eskosol argues, Blusun claimed only for its reflective losses as a shareholder in Eskosol, while Eskosol is claiming for 100% of the company\u2019s losses arising out of the two contested measures at issue. Eskosol also notes that Italy offers no support for the assertion that Blusun requested damages for \"all harms also claimed by Eskosol,\" and that under Italian law shareholders \"cannot exercise the rights of the company.\"305\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 48.\n\n**2. Abuse of Rights**\n----------------------\n\n**a. Italy\u2019s position**\n-----------------------\n\n253.\n\nItaly argues that the fact \"[t]hat the Blusun proceedings resulted in a decision in favour of Respondent only proves that Italy should not serve as respondent again for a challenge of the same measures under the ECT, for alleged damages caused to the same business.\"306\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 127.\n\n254.\n\nAccording to Italy, \"an investor controlling more than one entity by vertical integration will commit an abuse if it seeks to challenge the same measures and claim for the same harm at various levels.\"307 It argues that since the *Orascom* tribunal applied this principle in the presence of multiple treaties leading to parallel protection, *a fortiori* the principle must apply when the same treaty is at stake.308\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 151 (quoting *Orascom*, RL-57, \u00b6\u00b6 540-543 (quotation omitted)).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 152.\n\n255.\n\nItaly also states as follows:\n\n[w]hether there is identity between the two claimants, concededly, is a matter of perspective. Formally, shareholders are distinct from the company. In practice, they might be inextricably linked. The rationale of *RSM* was deployed in cases of 100% ownership, but there is no principled reason why it should not apply in other cases where ownership is lower. For instance, the *Orascom* tribunal did not hinge its finding of inadmissibility on the condition of 100% ownership, but on the specific circumstances of the case, which evinced the abusive duplication of the claims even if these were based on different treaties.309\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 129.\n\n256.\n\nThis, in Italy\u2019s view, was confirmed by Eskosol when it recalled that its application in the *Blusun* case under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) was made to ensure that Blusun could not claim the damages that only Eskosol could rightfully claim. According to Italy, \"Blusun *did*, in fact, claim the share of damages on which Eskosol claimed monopoly. That the case failed on the merits is irrelevant to this point.\"310\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 130.\n\n257.\n\nItaly also asserts that, should the Claimant\u2019s thesis that it has been at all times under the control of Blusun be accepted, then the investor has \"abused of its right by duplicating requests for redress under the ECT by taking benefit of the possibility *in abstracto* to access arbitration separately in its own name and through its local company.\"311\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 155.\n\n258.\n\nItaly finally distinguishes this case from the situation in *CME*,312 on the grounds that here, Italy sought (rather than refused) to consolidate proceedings.313 Moreover, given that Eskosol waited more than two years after the start of the *Blusun* case to file its claim, the \"[a]lleged lack of cooperation by Blusun should indeed be at least confronted with Eskosol\u2019s own responsibility for postponing any serious attempt to intervene in the Blusun arbitration to claim its rights.\"314\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 14 March 2003, CL-142 (\"*CME*\").\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 158-159; Rejoinder, \u00b6 131.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 161.\n\n**b. Eskosol\u2019s position**\n-------------------------\n\n259.\n\nEskosol claims that the circumstances in *Orascom,* on which Italy relies for its abuse of process objection, were unique and are not present here. In *Orascom*, the tribunal found that: \"(i) \u2018the dispute being notified in the three notices is effectively one and the same\u2019; and (ii) that all three notices of dispute were sent by Mr. Sawiris who owned and controlled each of the three vertically integrated companies.\"315 Eskosol also notes Algeria\u2019s argument in that case that \"Mr. Sawiris used his group of companies to seek to maximize his chances of success by introducing several arbitration proceedings against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies.\"316 This case, by contrast, does not involve a single person or entity seeking to maximize its chances by repeat arbitrations. To the contrary, there has been a complete lack of cooperation between Blusun and Eskosol.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 52.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 52.\n\n260.\n\nEskosol also rejects Italy\u2019s assertion that it \"should not be penalized for the lack of coordination between Eskosol and Blusun.\"317 As explained, Eskosol\u2019s delay in filing the application under Rule 37(2) in the *Blusun* case was due to the difficulties associated with representing a company in bankruptcy. Moreover, the Rule 37(2) application would not have allowed Eskosol to assert its rights in the *Blusun* case, but solely to be heard as a non-party. Regarding consolidation, Eskosol repeats that it was Blusun who rejected that possibility.318\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 54.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n\n261.\n\nFinally, Eskosol argues that \"there can be multiple legitimate investors under an ECT claim, as Italy itself admits.\"319 Blusun and Eskosol are not acting in privity nor in concert, and they do not represent the same interests. Eskosol agrees with the Tribunal\u2019s statement in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection that \"it would not be appropriate for tribunals to preclude arbitration by qualified investors [such as Eskosol], simply because other qualified investors may have proceeded before them without their participation.\"320\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 56.\n\nResponse to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 56 (quoting Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 170).\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal is not called upon to decide whether, as a matter of either efficiency or fairness, it would be preferable for all shareholders of an entity affected by a challenged State measure to be heard in a single forum at a single time, together with the entity that they collectively own. The Tribunal previously observed that it is \"not unsympathetic to Italy\u2019s circumstances, having to face claims now that are closely related to those it already successfully vanquished in a prior proceeding.\"321 But ultimately, these are system design questions that present policy issues, none of which are before the Tribunal. As the Tribunal also noted in its prior decision, \"States have the power to create [such a system] if they so wish,\" but the fact remains that they have not done so in either instrument relevant to this case. Specifically, \"neither the ICSID system as presently designed, nor the ECT itself, incorporate clear avenues (much less a requirement)\" for such joinder or consolidation.322\n\n*See* Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 170.\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 170.\n\n263.\n\nIn these circumstances, the issue is not whether Eskosol\u2019s claims present certain overlapping issues of law or fact with those previously presented by Blusun. Rather, the question is whether, in circumstances where Eskosol *otherwise would be permitted* to bring an ECT claim on its own behalf pursuant to ECT Article 26(7), it *should be precluded from doing so* simply because Blusun previously invoked different articles of the ECT to bring its own claims.323 The Tribunal considered this question preliminarily in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, and does so again now with the benefit of the Parties\u2019 additional briefing. In the end, however, its conclusion remains the same.\n\n*See* Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 166 (noting that \"[t]he ECT authorizes a variety of entities to proceed as qualified \u2018Investor[s]' under its terms,\" including both foreign investors who can bring claims under Article 26(1) relating to investments that they \"own[] or control[] directly or indirectly,\" and local companies who are permitted to bring claims in their own name provided they meet the foreign control requirements of Article 26(7); \"Italy itself admits that in principle, both Blusun and Eskosol could be legitimate investors under the ECT.\").\n\n264.\n\nFirst, whether viewed through the lens of *res judicata,* related preclusion doctrines like collateral estoppel, or abuse of process, the fact remains that Eskosol and Blusun are not the same party, either formally or in essence. In both *RSM* and *Orascom*, tribunals were presented with situations where a local company was wholly owned by ultimate beneficial owner(s) who maneuvered to bring duplicative proceedings. In *RSM*, a corporate claimant sued first, and after losing the case it sued a second time, this time joined by the three shareholders who collectively owned 100% of RSM. The tribunal found that because the three shareholders had entire control over RSM, they effectively had acted in concert with it and had their interests represented in the first proceeding, and therefore could not proceed with the second one.324 In *Orascom*, which involved a vertical chain of companies each ultimately owned 100% by the same individual, \"the Claimant first caused one of its subsidiaries, OTH, to bring claims against Algeria. Then, it caused a different subsidiary in the chain, Weather Investments, to threaten to bring a different arbitration in relation to the same dispute. Finally... it pursued yet another investment treaty proceeding in its own name for the same investment... in relation to the same host state measures and the same harm.\" The Tribunal found this to be \"an abuse of the system of investment protection.\"325\n\n*RSM Production Corp. and others v. Grenada*, ICSD Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 1 September 2010, RL-4, \u00b6\u00b6 7.1.5-7.1.6. In its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, the Tribunal expressed the view that \"the same conclusion [as in *RSM*] would be equally logical in the reverse situation, if a first case were brought by the 100% shareholders of a local company and thereafter a second case was attempted by the local company that they wholly owned.\" Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 167.\n\n*Orascom*, RL-57, \u00b6 545.\n\n265.\n\nIn this case, by contrast, Eskosol is not wholly owned by Blusun, and there are no facts suggesting the exercise by Blusun of some hidden hand in order to cause a second claim to be brought on its behalf. As anomalous as the situation may be, it is apparent not only that Blusun proceeded in its case without joining Eskosol as a formal party to the proceedings, \"as controlling shareholders often have the power to do by following the corporate formalities necessary to obtain approval to sue on a company\u2019s behalf,\"326 but also that Blusun actively resisted any input or participation by Eskosol, when the latter sought to join the Blusun proceedings or to be heard in them as a non-party. It is also apparent that the current proceedings did not come about as a result of some deliberate maneuvering by Blusun in order to have a proverbial \"second bite at the apple.\" Indeed, Eskosol did not present either of Blusun\u2019s owners (Mr. Lecorcier and Mr. Stein) as fact witnesses on its behalf, nor did they attend any of the Hearings as its party representatives. There was fact testimony from Eskosol\u2019s witness Mr. Scognamiglio (one of Eskosol\u2019s two minority shareholders) about a falling out between the erstwhile partners, such that \"Mr. Lecorcier, at the end of 2011, stopped talking to me.\"327\n\nDecision on Rule 41(5) Objection, \u00b6 168.\n\nTr. Day 1 [Scognamiglio] 210:24-25.\n\n266.\n\nThe fact that the minority shareholders in Eskosol are Italian nationals, who would not have been qualified to pursue a proceeding in their own names, does not affect the analysis. Where an international treaty authorizes a claim to be brought by a local company, that company speaks for itself, and not as a vehicle only for the interests of whichever shareholders might have sued on their own behalf on the basis of their qualifying nationality. Similarly, the local company may seek redress for 100% of the losses it allegedly suffered from the challenged State measures, and not simply for some prorated portion of those losses reflecting the percentage of its shares that are owned by qualifying foreign nationals. If the company is successful in proving both liability and damages, the end result may well be some eventual indirect benefit to its shareholders (including both the qualified foreign shareholders and other shareholders of non-qualifying nationalities), but that does not follow automatically as a matter of economic analysis, since - depending on the company\u2019s circumstances - there may be others (such as creditors) who hold priority claims ahead of any shareholder distribution. In any event, the ultimate distribution of any recovery by a local company has no impact on the company\u2019s right under the ECT to bring a claim on its own behalf for the full extent of its losses, even if some of its shareholders may be nationals of the host State or of third countries who could not have brought ECT claims on their own behalves.\n\n267.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal acknowledges that if any damages Eskosol recovered were sufficient to allow for distribution to shareholders after resolving priority debt obligations, Blusun itself could benefit indirectly from Eskosol\u2019s recovery, despite previously failing in its direct claim against Italy.328 The Tribunal accepts the awkwardness of this outcome, but it is one that arises mainly because of the odd circumstances of this case, where a majority shareholder and the company in which it holds shares did not have aligned interests and did not coordinate their respective litigations, but rather acted in various respects at cross-purposes with one another. The Tribunal is confident that this situation does not arise regularly. However, the possibility of an awkward outcome in an anomalous case, that could result in some indirect benefit to a *prior litigant* who lost a prior case, is not a reason in principle to strip a *current litigant* of a right to arbitration that the ECT expressly grants it, to pursue claims on its own behalf.\n\nSince Blusun failed in its direct claim against Italy, this would not present any risk of double-recovery. The Tribunal agrees with *Orascom* that tribunals should always remain alert to prevent such an outcome, to ensure that once \"the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration,\" the other companies in the vertical chain not be permitted \"to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances.\" *Orascom*, RL-57, \u00b6 495.\n\n268.\n\nItaly\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are therefore denied.\n\n**VII. LIABILITY**\n------------------\n\n269.\n\nEskosol contends that the measures Italy adopted breached its obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT, in particular with respect to the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") standard, the umbrella clause, the obligation to provide full protection to Eskosol\u2019s investment, the prohibition on unreasonable or discriminatory measures, and the restrictions on expropriation.329\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 247.\n\n270.\n\nItaly rejects Eskosol\u2019s claims as unfounded both in fact and in law.330 By way of introduction applicable to all of Eskosol\u2019s claims, Italy argues that Eskosol never even reached a point at which it might complain about changes in Italy\u2019s incentives schemes, because any investments Eskosol made were \"preparatory and, necessarily, separate from the investments to which the incentive schemes apply.\"331 Eskosol \"had *some* investments in Italy, but never was or ever put itself close to concretely be an energy producer, let alone one who could actually benefit from the benefit schemes.\"332 As such, Italy considers that while Eskosol might qualify as \"a promoter\" in the photovoltaic industry, it should not be confused with an ongoing energy-producing concern,333 a distinction that Italy considers fatal at the threshold to each of Eskosol\u2019s claims.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 226-230.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 231.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 231.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 232.\n\n271.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 arguments with respect to these issues are addressed in turn below, with particular emphasis on the FET claim, to which they devoted most of their attention in the submissions. First, however, the Tribunal summarizes the Parties\u2019 positions on the relevance or lack of relevance of the *Blusun* award to the liability issues this Tribunal must decide, a point that the Parties have each addressed.\n\n**A. Relevance of the** ***Blusun*** **Award to Liability Issues**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Eskosol\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n272.\n\nEskosol contends that the Tribunal should not be influenced by the outcome in the *Blusun* case (where all claims against Italy were rejected on the merits), since Blusun and Eskosol are not identical and do not share the same interest.334\n\nReply, \u00b6 175.\n\n273.\n\nEskosol also observes that the claims in the two arbitrations are not identical. In its view, Blusun based its case on a number of events in addition to the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, and Blusun\u2019s position was that Italy had never created in the first place a stable and predictable investment climate for solar energy, which allegedly prevented financing for the project to be obtained. By contrast, Eskosol\u2019s claim is that it decided to invest in Italy in part on the basis of the stability and consistency of Italy\u2019s laws,335 and that by adopting the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, Italy suddenly and drastically changed the energy laws on which Eskosol had relied to make its investment.\n\nReply, \u00b6 176.\n\n274.\n\nEskosol further argues that the two cases do not concern the same losses or even the same asserted infringements of the ECT. Eskosol\u2019s losses constitute 100% of the losses arising from the challenged measures, whereas Blusun claimed only for its reflective losses deriving from its shareholding interest in Eskosol.336 Moreover, while the *Blusun* tribunal determined that the economic impact of the reduction in FiTs under Conto Energia IV was 13%, Eskosol contends that the impact was \"at least 31%, if not more.\" Eskosol also argues that the *Blusun* tribunal failed to give due consideration to the Romani Decree, for example by failing to appreciate the invalidity of the overcapacity arguments on which that Decree was based, and by failing to appreciate that the Decree eliminated the grace period included in Conto Energia III, which increased the overall risk of the Eskosol Project.337\n\nReply, \u00b6 177.\n\nReply, \u00b6 177.\n\n**2. Italy\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------\n\n275.\n\nItaly states that the *Blusun* award gives a direct answer to Eskosol\u2019s arguments:\n\n- Eskosol affirms that, but for the contested measures, the Project would have been realized and would have obtained incentives. The Blusun award clearly states that \"(...) the Project ran a significant risk of incurring legal and administrative difficulties, even if these could be (and in the event largely were) overcome. Its success was by no means certain.\" (\u00a7386)\n\n- In particular, the Claimant states that the suspension of the Siemens EPC was due to the Romani Decree. The *Blusun* award responds that \"on 28 February 2011, Eskosol failed to make the 20% down payment for the first tranche of panels and on 7 March 2011, Siemens suspended performance of the EPC contract, which was never reinstated (...). Eskosol\u2019s failure to pay *predated* the Romani Decree of 3 March 2011.\" (\u00a7390)\n\n- Moreover, according to Eskosol the contested measures would have been the cause for the Project not being financed, and there would be no possible alternative reasons for the Project to fail aside the adoption of the Romani Decree and the entry into force of Conto Energia IV. The *Blusun* award rejects such claim stating that \"no commitments of project financing were, however, obtained *at this* [the time of the Romani Decree] or any time\" (\u00a7100), and that \"of far greater weight [to make the Project fail] was the continued dependence on project financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended.\" (\u00a7394).\n\n- On the other side, according to the Claimant, the *Conto Energia III* would have generated legitimate expectations. The *Blusun* tribunal rejects such assertion and declares that any already marginal expectations that the decree could create would be \"even less powerful because European law had already lowered them: it was clear that the incentives offered were subject to modification in light, inter alia, of changing costs and improved technology\" (\u00a7371).338\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 120 (quoting *Blusun,* RL-56, \u00b6\u00b6 371, 386, 390, 394).\n\n276.\n\nItaly also relies on the following findings in *Blusun* regarding the legitimacy of the Romani Decree:\n\n(a) The reduction in FITs was quite substantial, but was not in itself crippling or disabling. Moreover, it was a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large take-up under the earlier Energy Accounts.\n\n(b) The reduction in incentives was proportionately less than the reduction in the cost of photovoltaic technology during 2010, and left Italian subsidy levels higher than those in Germany, France and Spain.\n\n(c) The principle of guaranteed tariffs for a 20-year period was maintained.\n\n(d) So too was the criterion for qualification for FITs, viz., connection to the grid.\n\n(e) The grace period for grid connection to preserve the preexisting tariff level, viz., 12 months, was reasonable.\n\n(f) The Fourth Energy Account, applying to photovoltaic plants connected to the grid between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016, made some allowance for projects that could not meet the cut-off of 12 months.\n\n(g) Leaving aside questions of administration (dealt with below), the provision for a register of large plants eligible for feed-in tariffs contributed to legal security.\n\n(h) The limits on the use of agricultural land were motivated by valid rural planning concerns, although their specific impact on the Puglia Project is a matter to which the Tribunal will return (see paragraphs 403-408). For these reasons the Tribunal concludes that the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, taken overall, were not disproportionate, did not violate specific commitments made to the promotors of PV plants, and did not breach Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT.339\n\n*Blusun,* RL-56, \u00b6\u00b6 342-343; Resp. PHB, \u00b6 120.\n\n277.\n\nItaly sees this analysis as \"objective and articulate,\" listing \"several concurring reasons why the regulatory change, far from amounting to unfair or inequitable treatment, was a balanced and carefully designed measure.\"340\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 351.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Parties\u2019 respective arguments about the similarities and differences between this case and the *Blusun* case, but sees no threshold issue, in reality, for it to decide. Italy does not contend that the *Blusun* findings are binding on this Tribunal; to the contrary, it expressly disclaims any argument on the merits that \"the *Blusun* award has any binding force or superior authority.\"341 Italy\u2019s argument is simply that the award \"offers a compelling analysis of the legal issue at stake,\"342 an assessment with which Eskosol disagrees. The Parties thus implicitly concur that the Tribunal should take the *Blusun* award into consideration only to the extent it finds the reasoning of that case to be persuasive, a proposition that is no different than the way in which the Tribunal evaluates any other jurisprudence to which its attention has been drawn. In any event, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal emphasizes that it resolves the pending issues in this claim based on its own independent analysis, and not on the basis of the decisions of other tribunals.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 263.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 263.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Eskosol\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n279.\n\nInvoking a \"broad\" or \"flexible\" conception of the fair and equitable treatment standard,343 Eskosol contends that the measures Italy adopted breached the standard in six respects. In its view, Italy (i) violated Eskosol\u2019s legitimate expectations, (ii) failed to provide a stable and predictable framework for its investments, (iii) did not act transparently, (iv) behaved inconsistently, (e) acted arbitrarily and unreasonably, and (v) adopted disproportionate measures.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 250.\n\n**a. Italy\u2019s violation of Eskosol\u2019s legitimate expectations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nEskosol contends that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 10(1) of the ECT includes the obligation not to frustrate investors\u2019 legitimate expectations.344 Those \"legitimate expectations [can arise] from representations and guarantees provided by the host state, including in its legislation and regulations.\"345 In Eskosol\u2019s view, these guarantees give rise to the obligation not to frustrate legitimate expectations especially when the State \"deliberately and actively [seeks] to create those expectations.\"346\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 252 (citing *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

In particular, it did not contain a sunset provision and the incentivizing tariffs were remarkably reduced from Conto Energia III levels.366 Indeed, Eskosol argues that:\n\nit is misleading for Italy to suggest that [the natural progression between Conto Energia II and III] can be compared to what occurred with CE III, when it was suddenly replaced 2.5 years before schedule with CE IV. That was not an expected natural progression. On the contrary, the Romani Decree and CE IV expressly violated the terms of CE III.\n\nFor example, CE III was designed to last three years 2011, 2012 and 2013, as made clear by Article 8.2, but the Romani Decree cut CE III short by 2.5 years. Under CE III, Italy promised to grant 3,000 MWs worth of FiTs, but the witness evidenced confirmed that CE III was cut off when approximately 1,600 MW had been granted. Thus, for the first time ever a Conto Energia had been terminated before schedule and without the ceiling on FiTs even being reached. In addition, CE III assured that if the ceiling was reached investors would have another 14 months to receive FiTs if their plants entered into operation by then. The sunset provision of CE III provisions was thrown out by the Romani Decree entirely. This just makes clear that the Romani Decree cut short CE III in an unprecedented manner in violation of the express assurances that investors such as Eskosol had been given in CE III itself.367\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 286.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 145-146.\n\n289.\n\nEskosol notes that the importance of the sunset provision in this arbitration is twofold: (i) first, it made Eskosol\u2019s reliance on Conto Energia III \"not only reasonable, but beyond question.... With the assurance of a sunset clause of 14 months, Eskosol clearly knew that it had sufficient time to complete its project\";368 (ii) second, it is also significant for its absence in Conto Energia IV, which \"fundamentally changed the assurances previously relied upon by Eskosol. Now Eskosol had to face the risk that the new ceilings imposed under CE IV could be reached quickly; and if they were it faced the risk that it would receive zero FiTs. Of course, Eskosol could never find a bank to lend its [sic] hundreds of millions of project finance funds, the repayment of which depend on the stability of FiTs on this basis.\"369 Eskosol clarifies that its case rests not just on the elimination of the sunset clause but on the combined impact of the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV.370\n\nCl.

In its view, the tariff structure of the Conto Energia schemes already contained a periodic, gradual decrease to reflect the anticipated reduction in costs of PV technology. By contrast, the Romani Decree was not gradual, the reduction from Conto Energia III to Conto Energia IV was unexpected and substantial, and the 10% rule on agricultural land was a surprise that unfairly affected Eskosol.372\n\nReply, \u00b6 131; *see also id.,* \u00b6 133 (rejecting Italy's reliance on *Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands B.V. v.

Moreover, Eskosol invested \u20ac41.8 million of its own capital to this project and was planning to invest another \u20ac80 million. It also rejects Italy\u2019s allegation that Eskosol suffered from financial difficulties before the Romani Decree appeared, for which Italy relies only on the fact that the first payment to Siemens was not made. Eskosol notes that Professor Delfanti withdrew this point at the Hearing, and agreed that this payment was not missed but rather postponed, by agreement of Siemens and Eskosol, to 28 February 2011. Eskosol says that \"by the time that payment was due on 28 February 2011, Italy\u2019s Conto Energia system was already starting to collapse.\"388 Moreover, Eskosol notes that Unicredit \"had a vested interest in completing these negotiations as it already had furnished a \u20ac6.1 million loan agreement to SIB to construct the substations, the payment back of which depended on the success of the Eskosol Project.\"389\n\nReply, \u00b6 100.\n\nCl.

It recalls that, in order to qualify for these incentives, it not only would have had to register the plants by 30 June 2011 (which it did), but also to complete construction of the plants by 28 March 2012, as a result of the Romani Decree\u2019s 10% rule for plants built on agricultural land.394 At the same time, Eskosol argues, financing to complete the construction was unavailable for several reasons. Among these reasons is that under Conto Energia IV, the Eskosol Project faced a drastic reduction in profitability (of at least 31%) relative to Conto Energia III. According to Eskosol\u2019s experts, the Equity IRR of the project would have been reduced from 21.1% under Conto Energia III to 8.9% under Conto Energia IV, even on a *ceteris paribus* basis, *i.e.,* without taking into account the regulatory uncertainty generated by the Romani Decree.395\n\nReply, \u00b6 79.\n\nReply, \u00b6 80.\n\n299.\n\nEskosol further argues that Conto Energia IV included a \"maximum payment mechanism\" and eliminated the 14-month sunset period that had existed under Conto Energia III, which undermined the bankability and feasibility of the project.396\n\nReply, \u00b6 82 (citing Stickel/Longhi, \u00b6\u00b6 78-83).\n\n300.\n\nEskosol says that Italy \"offers no evidence to substantiate its claim [that] other entrepreneurs were facing similar circumstances as Eskosol\" or that Eskosol still should have been able to succeed under Conto Energia IV.397 It challenges Italy\u2019s reliance on tables showing: (i) how much capacity was generated in total by plants of all sizes operating under each Conto Energia scheme, I, II, III, IV and V (R-38); and (ii) identifying only the quantity of energy generated under Conto Energia II by plants of different sizes located in various regions (R-39).398 Eskosol also challenges certain data Italy provided on the bases that it was specifically generated for this arbitration, and that Italy failed to indicate the sources used to compile the data or produce the underlying material.399\n\nReply, \u00b6 84.\n\nReply, \u00b6 84.\n\nReply, \u00b6 85.\n\n301.\n\nIn particular, Eskosol challenges Italy\u2019s reliance on pages 8-11 of R-40, arguing that it does not show that Eskosol could have been profitable because \"the plant clusters discussed therein are not in any way comparable to Eskosol.\"400 Eskosol argues as follows:\n\nit is not clear whether the plants comprising the Blasi and Casignano clusters were owned and operated by one entity. By contrast, Eskosol owned and operated 120 plants. The construction of 120 solar plants is not the same as building and financing a *single* solar plant, especially considering that none of the 120 plants in the project could be connected to the national grid without financing the required connection works, including the substations.\n\nFurther, none of the Blasi and Casignano plants was apparently responsible for building the substations or the connection rings. Instead, an entity called Energia Uno financed and oversaw the construction of the connection works. This document does not explain who Energia Uno is, what financial arrangement it had with each of the 71 individual plants it helped to connect, or how it obtained the financing to construct the substations and build the grid that connected the individual plants to one another.401\n\nReply, \u00b6 86.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; *see also* Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 159-161.\n\n302.\n\nAdditionally, Eskosol argues that it could not have met the agricultural requirements imposed by the Romani Decree. Eskosol\u2019s business plan was for each of the projected 120 power plants to occupy 50% of the land on which they were based. This could not be altered, and the project could not be constructed in time to meet the exception provided for by the Romani Decree, *i.e.,* by the 28 March 2012 deadline, because Italy\u2019s actions made arranging financing for that construction impossible.402\n\nReply, \u00b6 88; Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 154, 157-158 (relying on Professor Delfanti's testimony).\n\n303.\n\nIn that regard, Eskosol takes issue with the requirement under Conto Energia IV to register all plants entering into operation after 31 August 2011 on a national register administered by the GSE as a precondition to receive the incentivizing tariffs. Eskosol registered the plants \"to mitigate its damages\" but \"the approval process was lengthy and riddled with problems.\"403 The list published by the GSE on 15 July 2011 included 115 of Eskosol\u2019s 120 plants, but this list was not final. There were two other lists, one on 12 August and the final one on 16 September 2011, which included 113 of Eskosol\u2019s plants. In Eskosol\u2019s view, \"[n]o investor would agree to finance the Eskosol project before or during the time that GSE continued to finalize its list of plants eligible to receive incentives,\" and \"[s]ix months was not enough time\" after the list was finalized to complete construction.404\n\nReply, \u00b6 90.\n\nReply, \u00b6 91.\n\n304.\n\nEskosol also mentions that, in October 2011, Messrs.

Regarding another letter from Elyseum, Eskosol notes that this \"does not contain the amount of the specific offer or any other specific terms,\" and was subject to conditions that made it unacceptable.410\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 217.\n\nReply, \u00b6 94.\n\nReply, \u00b6 95.\n\n***ii.

PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 174-182.\n\n312.\n\nEskosol argues that the premature termination of Conto Energia III was contrary to the stability required under international law, and that the renewable energy sector was left in the dark about what scheme, if any, would replace Conto Energia III, because the Romani Decree anticipated a reduction in the incentivized tariffs but under unknown conditions.421 This created great uncertainty among the banks that had funded projects in the solar PV sector in Italy and put at risk the financing of new projects, as expressed by the Association of Foreign Banks in Italy and several members of Italy\u2019s Chamber of Deputies at the time.422\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 296, 299.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 296-298.\n\n313.\n\nEskosol argues that Conto Energia IV caused further instability by eliminating the sunset clause and slashing incentivizing tariffs \"by as much as 30% in some cases in comparison to the relevant tariffs under Conto Energia III.\"423\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 299.\n\n**c. Italy\u2019s failure to act transparently**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nEskosol also contends that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 10(1) of the ECT includes the obligation to act transparently,424 as defined by the tribunals in *Metalclad* and *Tecmed*.425\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 301.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 301, citing *Metalclad*, CL-115/RL-73, \u00b6 76:  \nThe Tribunal understands this [\"transparency\"] to include the idea that all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under the Agreement should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors of another Party. There should be no room for doubt or uncertainty on such matters.  \nAnd citing *Tecmed*, CL-108/RL-80, \u00b6 154:  \n[The foreign investor] expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations.\n\n315.\n\nEskosol contends that Italy\u2019s Government officials told potential investors that the then-existing Conto Energia scheme was stable and confirmed Italy\u2019s commitment to the development of PV energy in Italy in its Action Plan in June 2011 and in meetings with Mr. Scognamiglio.426 Subsequent changes left Eskosol \"without any ability to understand what, if any, incentives Eskosol would be able to secure under the forthcoming Conto Energia IV.\"427 Eskosol contends that this amounted to a failure to act transparently and hence a violation of Italy\u2019s fair and equitable treatment obligations.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 305-306 (citing National Press agencies Review of the 2010 Italian PV Summit, C-27 and National Action Plan, C-29 (incorrectly cited as CL-29 in Memorial), as well as Scognamiglio I, \u00b6 24).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 308.\n\n**d. Italy\u2019s inconsistent conduct**\n-----------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nEskosol also contends, based on certain investment arbitration jurisprudence, that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 10(1) of the ECT requires States to act consistently.428\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 309-311 (citing *Tecmed*, CL-108/RL-80, \u00b6 154, and *Occidental,* CL-116, \u00b6 184 (citations omitted)).\n\n317.\n\nAccording to Eskosol, it was given both public and individual assurances as to the stability of the regulatory framework in the solar PV sector.429 However, one day after the publication of the Guide to Conto Energia III, the Government released documents arguing for the revision of the incentivizing tariffs. One month later, with the publication of the Third Draft Romani Decree, it became apparent that the support scheme would be wiped out. The Romani Decree then declared that the incentivizing tariffs under Conto Energia III would end on 31 May 2011, effectively abrogating the applicable ceiling and sunset protection mechanism.430 This inconsistent behavior \"destroyed the economic foundations\" of the project, rendering project financing unlikely.431\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 312-313 (referring in particular to GSE, *Guide to Conto Energia III*, January 2011, C-34).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 314-315.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 316.\n\n**e. Italy\u2019s arbitrary and unreasonable conduct**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nEskosol argues that the fair and equitable treatment obligation also includes a protection against arbitrary and unreasonable conduct, as defined by investment arbitration jurisprudence and the ICJ, *i.e.,* a \"willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks or... surprises a sense of judicial propriety.\"432 Eskosol also rejects Italy\u2019s reliance on *Parkerings,* which in its view imposes a prohibition on the State from acting unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power.433\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 318 (citing *Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) (United States of America v.

Italy\u2019s disproportionate conduct**\n---------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nEskosol further argues that the fair and equitable treatment obligation entails an analysis of the proportionality of the State conduct, and argues that the State conduct must be \"reasonably related and appropriately narrow to address a legitimate State interest.\"437\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 326 (referring to *MTD Equity Sdn.

Italy\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------\n\n325.\n\nItaly contends that the reference in the first sentence of the ECT\u2019s Article 10(1) to creating attractive \"conditions for Investors... to make Investments,\" while helpful to the interpretation of the whole clause, is hardly autonomous from those that follow in the same provision.443 In any event, Eskosol\u2019s case rests on an alleged breach of the second sentence of Article 10(1), by alleging that Italy engaged in specific unfair or inequitable conduct. In advancing this argument, Italy explains that Eskosol targets the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV insofar as they allegedly rolled back benefits that were available under Conto Energia III, and therefore Eskosol\u2019s claim does not go to the stability of the Italian regulatory system over the years or allege any systemic unreliability of Italian law at large, but rather concerns one principal event: the lowering of the tariffs that Eskosol hoped to receive for the planned plants.444\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 235, 239, citing *Isolux*, RL-60, \u00b6\u00b6 764-766.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 235-236.\n\n326.\n\nItaly notes the lack of definition of FET in the ECT. In its opinion, the Tribunal should interpret the standard in accordance with the standard of protection of aliens and their property under customary international law and arbitral practice.445 More specifically, Italy argues that the FET standard \"is a corollary of good faith and fairness, not an insurance policy against business mishaps.\"446 Thus, the core of the analysis \"is not the inconvenience of the measures perceived by the single investor, but their objective fairness assessed in light of the circumstances.\"447\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 237.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 238.\n\n**a. The notion of legitimate expectations**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nItaly objects to the notion of legitimate expectations adopted by Eskosol. It states that Eskosol \"takes for granted that the \u2018FET standard contains a prohibition against host States conduct that violates the legitimate expectations that an investor has when it makes an investment. \u2019\"448 In Italy\u2019s view, by contrast, Article 10(1) ECT contains no such prohibition. What might constitute a breach of the FET obligation are specific instances of State conduct that are unfair or inequitable. \"Among such instances, it is certainly possible that a breach result[s] from acts that destroy investor\u2019s interests that had been generated through specific State promises or representations,\" but no interpretation of the applicable legal test can dispense with the actual ascertainment of whether unfairness or inequity occurred.449\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 242.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 242.\n\n328.\n\nItaly argues that \"[e]xpectations are representations of facts and rules that investors derive from the conduct of the authorities of the State. Reliance on these representations can be critical to the decision to make an investment and how to shape it. These expectations must be legitimate: not all expectations deserve protection under the ECT, but only those that have a legal backing, are specific to the investment, and are reasonable.\"450\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 274; *see also* \u00b6 277.\n\n329.\n\nAccording to Italy, in Eskosol\u2019s construction \"the standard expands almost indefinitely to protect the expectation that certain rights will be available for acquisition, and in a particular format, in the future.\"451 Yet \"[n]one of the few cases in which legitimate expectations were successfully invoked found a State\u2019s obligation to guarantee that an investor could acquire certain rights that had been available at a previous time also at a later time, and under the same conditions.\"452 Indeed, in all the cases Eskosol cited, \"the regulatory change deteriorated the position of investors that already were subject to the State measures and counted on their continued application in the future,\" which is \"certainly not the case [of Eskosol] which... never [qualified] under Conto Energia III.\"453\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 275.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 275.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 276.\n\n330.\n\nItaly further argues that Eskosol makes the determination of unfairness or inequity an automatic consequence of any disappointment of the expectations. In its view, however, \"whether any breach of expectations is unfair and inequitable cannot be taken for granted, but is precisely what needs to be looked into to assess the State\u2019s compliance with the FET standard.\"454 In consequence, Eskosol cannot say that every time that an expectation is not fully respected there is a breach of the treaty. \"[W]hat matters is not just the entity of the disrespect, but also all the other factors that might point to its being fair (the circumstances, the proportionality with respect to its professed goals, the foreseeability) or not.\"455 Indeed, even when a violation of an investor\u2019s legitimate expectation is found, the breach of the FET standard depends on some crucial additional findings.456\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 278.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 279.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 280 (citing *Micula*, CL-113, \u00b6 726) (citation omitted).\n\n331.\n\nOn the issue of legitimate expectations, Italy contends that the awards on which Eskosol relies are not pertinent to the facts of this case.457 In *Saluka*, for example, \"the tribunal concluded that, in the framework of the Czech Republic\u2019s open plan to align its regulations to EU standards, the regulatory change should have been anticipated: the investor was \u2018not justified to expect that the [host State] would not introduce a more rigid system of prudential regulation and thereby change the framework for Nomura\u2019s investment.\u2019\"458 In fact, in *Saluka,* the only breach that the tribunal found was discrimination, of which there is no suggestion in the present case. In Italy\u2019s view, *Tecmed* does not support Eskosol\u2019s case either, as there the host State \"had first granted and then refused to renew the operating license, making it factually impossible for the investor to pursue its business, not just less profitable.\"459 Here Italy did not provide any specific guarantee to Eskosol, and never precluded it from implementing the project.460 Italy also distinguishes this case from the investment cases against Argentina, which involved ongoing business concerns subject to precise State obligations contained in concession agreements signed with the investors.461 Here, the passage from Conto Energia III to Conto Energia IV constituted \"a modulation\" of the profits guaranteed under the incentives regime, \"not an evisceration of any operating profitable business.\"462 As the *Blusun* tribunal noted, Italy had \"still relatively generous levels of FiTs\" after the transition from Conto Energia III to Conto Energia IV.463\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 266.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 267.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 268.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 268.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 269-270.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 270.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 270 (citing *Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 391).\n\n332.\n\nItaly further challenges Eskosol\u2019s reliance on *Micula,* as in that case Romania eliminated tax incentives that lured investors to the country, whereas Italy simply adjusted the incentivized tariffs available for future applicants.464 Italy also distinguishes this case from *Eiser*, where the investor had built and operated the plants, and its plants were formally registered to receive benefits under the applicable regime.465\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 271.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 273.\n\n**b. The causal link**\n----------------------\n\n333.\n\nItaly contends that there is no causal link between the measures the Government adopted and the failure of the Eskosol Project. It states that Eskosol\u2019s plan to build between 113 and 120 operative plants in Puglia was \"at most very hopeful, but at least far from granted,\" and cites *Blusun* to the effect that the \"success [of the project] was by no means certain.\"466 Italy also says that the \"Claimant\u2019s shareholders made a hopeful but fatal double bet: they assumed that they would find a sponsor, and that the incentives available at the time of their initial investment would be still available, in the same exact amount, some years later.\"467 However, at no time did they qualify for the incentives, either under Conto Energia III or under any of those offered by the following measures. Italy adds that \"[i]t is not particularly surprising that banks refused to fund such plan.\"468 Indeed, Italy notes that one should not underestimate that lenders had a wide choice of less risky projects to fund, in the same years and in the same region as Eskosol\u2019s Project.469\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 246-247.\n\nResp.

PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 136-137.\n\n335.\n\nItaly further argues that even if *(arguendo)* Italy had promised Eskosol that the incentives would not change at all (which Italy denies), and even if the transition from Conto Energia III to Conto Energia IV *arguendo* breached that promise, Eskosol still could not have been affected by that, for two reasons.\n\n336.\n\nFirst, Eskosol never qualified under any incentive scheme. Eskosol never commissioned the plants during the time that Conto Energia III had indicated for its sunset application, nor does the record demonstrate that it was clearly in position to do so, based on arrangements already put in place as of the time the Romani Decree or Conto Energia entered into effect. In fact, the only relevant indication was the *projected* schedule of works of the Siemens EPC Contract, but Eskosol did not have enough funds lined up even to make the first payment when it became due.473\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 252-253.\n\n337.\n\nSecond, Eskosol has not proved that the shortened availability of Conto Energia III had any actual impact on its business plans. Italy agrees with Eskosol that \"the applicable standard of causation requires the identification of the allegedly wrongful act as the \u2018operative\u2019 or \u2018proximate\u2019 cause of the losses.\"474 In Italy\u2019s view, however, \"there is no provable causation at all.\" Italy reminds the Tribunal that Eskosol\u2019s president himself explained in 2012 that the \"preponderant\" circumstance that led to Eskosol\u2019s failure was the unexpected unresponsiveness of the banks. In its view, Italy\u2019s acts \"could have been secondary or marginally determinants of Eskosol\u2019s demise, at most.\"475\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 244.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 245 (citing Report of the President regarding the Events occurred in 2011, in Shortened financial statements for the business year until 31 December 2011, FMC-C2, p. 32); *see also* Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n338.\n\nIn Italy\u2019s view, nothing indicates that Eskosol\u2019s funding negotiation with Unicredit (which Italy sees as Eskosol\u2019s \"only remotely plausible funding negotiation\") was actually disrupted by the regulatory changes. The Romani Decree was adopted after Unicredit already had pulled out of the talks, and after Eskosol already had failed to make the first down payment to Siemens.476 Italy rejects as not credible any suggestion that Unicredit\u2019s commitment to approve a loan to SIB for \u20ac6 million demonstrates the likelihood of its granting a loan at least 57 times larger (\u20ac340 million), in collaboration with other banks yet to be found.477 Moreover, Italy notes that, in spite of Mr. Scognamiglio\u2019s statement that Eskosol had talked with 26 banks during the development of the Eskosol Project, no more than a preliminary term sheet by West LB can be found in the records. Moreover, this document shows that \"Eskosol needed financing by January 15th 2011 and that time was too tight to permit to reasonably respect such term[s] at the stage of negotiations.\"478 It also notes that, in spite of Dr. Stickel\u2019s suggestion that other funding forms such as bridge loans were available, no evidence was submitted to that end.479\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 254; *see also* Resp.

Italy suggests that the problem was Eskosol\u2019s plan \"to pack a mega project on paper, develop its supporting facilities on the ground and attract third-party investors, rather than build the batches of plants gradually.\"483 Italy contends that Mr. Stein essentially admitted as much, in a report accompanying Eskosol\u2019s balance sheet for the year 2011:\n\nThe motives and circumstances for that outcome [the project\u2019s failure leading to the company\u2019s insolvency], which is certainly not exciting, are ascribable to a negative conjuncture.

Claimant\u2019s investment was *the project,* not the solar field.\"487 Italy agrees with Eskosol that \"turnkey projects are a favourite of investors, given the low inherent risks. Yet they are [a] *challenge* for developers - like Claimant.\"488 It contends that Eskosol \"attempted to justify the functionality of the industrial plan and its financial underpinnings but systematically failed to address the elephant in the room: the scale and design of the project were Claimant\u2019s own business choices.\"489 The same holds true for the financial design of the project.490\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 153.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 154.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 155 (emphasis in original).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 156 (emphasis in original).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 160; *see also* Resp.

In Italy\u2019s view, this is an attempt \"to divert the Tribunal\u2019s attention from [Eskosol\u2019s] own entrepreneurial choice and somehow suggest that the design of the project is attributable to the Respondent.\"491 Italy explains that: ENEL is not Italy; ENEL did not and could not \"require\" anything; and even assuming that ENEL had suggested or proposed any course of action, this would have been in response to Eskosol\u2019s request, with a view to accommodate Eskosol\u2019s \"purely self-created needs.\"492 Italy further challenges Eskosol\u2019s assertion that the project needed to be large. In its view, the size of the project was a business choice, and the fact \"[t]hat a project needed to be so huge to break even and produce any profits suggests that it was financially fragile.\"493 The project was not \"robust\" because \"nobody was ready to finance it.\"494\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167 (citing Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24-25, 42).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 169; *see also* Resp.

Italy contends that the normal sequencing of works would have been to finalize the grid and the plants together, even if work on the grid might have been started earlier than on the plants.497 Eskosol\u2019s odd sequencing, in which it focused exclusively on the electrical substations needed to connect to the grid before beginning any construction whatsoever of the PV plants themselves, was inevitable (in Italy\u2019s view) only because Eskosol could not finance the construction of the plants. Eskosol \"could sign [the EPC Contract] for free but knew too well it could not pay for [it].\"498 Italy suggests that Eskosol needed the EPC Contract to attract financing for the project.499\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 181-183; *see also* Resp.

In its view, the EPC side letter may have meant that Eskosol technically was not in \"an already certifiable situation of default,\" but it still \"reflected [Eskosol\u2019s] lack of funds and impending troubles to find a financial sponsor (which incidentally was a contractual breach in its own right).\"504 Italy also highlights that, while Eskosol argues that \"[n]ot a single lender would touch Eskosol\u2019s project after the... \u2018State Measures\u2019, [that] is precisely what had happened also *before* the challenged measures.\"505\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 206.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 208; *see also* Resp. PHB, \u00b6 73.\n\n348.\n\nItaly makes several additional comments regarding Eskosol\u2019s financial difficulties. First, with respect to Eskosol\u2019s remark that the 2009 economic crisis led the banking industry to adopt a restrictive policy on lending, Italy suggests that the remark may have been \"aimed at shifting blame away from Claimant [but], more importantly, shifts it also away from Respondent.\"506 Second, Eskosol\u2019s reference to certain lawsuits by creditors which affected its reputation with lenders \"has absolutely nothing to do with Italy\u2019s actions.\"507\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 210.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 212.\n\n349.\n\nWith respect to Eskosol\u2019s complaint about the Romani Decree\u2019s restriction on agricultural land, Italy makes several points.508 It notes first that Eskosol\u2019s Memorial only mentioned this complaint in passing in a footnote, with the result that Eskosol\u2019s later accusation that \"Italy does not address this issue at all in its Counter-Memorial\" verges on the absurd. On the substance, Italy highlights that \"the requirements relating to the use of agricultural land did not apply until 28 March 2012 (one year after the entry into force of the [Romani] Decree).\"509 It also notes that by that date it was no longer required that plants already be in operation to qualify for incentives, but only they be tested and connected to the grid. If Eskosol had had a viable project, \"the construction of the plants could have been completed in time to be spared from the new regime on agricultural land.\"510 Indeed, Italy observes, Eskosol itself contends that \"administrative and permitting work took about 80%/90% of the total time required to complete a solar PV plant,\" so if that is true then the time available before March 2012 should have been sufficient for Eskosol to carry out the remaining 10% of the work.511 In fact, Italy contends, the record shows Eskosol\u2019s \"repeated attempts at constructing the plants in 2011, which failed for lack of financing.\"512 In Italy\u2019s view, the fact that Eskosol \"put efforts and money in the attempts to build the plants and accede the incentives under Conto Energia IV is enough evidence to reject the assertion... that it was impossible to do so in time.\"513 Italy also points out that Eskosol \"did finally decide to split construction of the plants and was thus able to find financing for smaller clusters, which it yet refused as not sufficiently interesting.\"514 Italy also notes that Eskosol \"hired *Capitale Syst\u00e8me Investissement* to promote the Project under Conto Energia IV and undertake some road shows.\"515\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 213-223.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 216.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 216; *see also* Resp.

PHB, \u00b6 106.\n\n350.\n\nItaly rejects on a number of other grounds Eskosol\u2019s argument that the Romani Decree caused the destruction of the investment. First, Italy says that Eskosol\u2019s references to the views of Italian MPs and newspaper articles are immaterial: \"[a]ny predictions that the Decreto Romani would cripple the industry proved to be exaggerated, and the hard data of the legions of investments that kept benefitting from Conto Energia IV and the later schemes must supersede any contemporaneous expression of discontent.\"516 In this regard, Italy refers again to the GSE documents showing the results of the different Conto Energia decrees.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 226.\n\n351.\n\nSecond, Italy defends its argument that the success of other power plants demonstrates that Eskosol\u2019s Project failed for reasons other than the regulatory changes. On this issue, Italy dismisses Eskosol\u2019s suggestion that the GSE tables Italy submitted about other plants have \"authenticity issues,\" arguing that the GSE customarily collects information from all power plants and makes it available online so all investors can consult it.517 Italy also rejects Eskosol\u2019s emphasis on differences in size and design of the different projects, making two points. The first is that Eskosol\u2019s argument actually confirms Italy\u2019s position, which \"the tribunal in *Blusun* understood with ease,\" that the main determinant of Eskosol\u2019s failure was its atypical size.518 In Italy\u2019s view, Eskosol\u2019s suspicion that the plants in Blasi and Casignano had lower connection costs reinforces the point that Eskosol\u2019s plan was \"risky, expensive, and subject to size-determinative atypical fragility, compared to industry\u2019s standards\";519 the Blasi-Casignano example is the best evidence that a significant project could have been done, in the same geographical area and at the very same point in time, despite the adoption of the Romani Decree.520 Italy\u2019s second point is that any distinctions between Eskosol\u2019s Project and the others simply highlight Eskosol\u2019s plan to circumvent the law: while Eskosol sought to take advantage of administrative shortcuts reserved for small plants of less than 1 MW, and to receive the higher incentives reserved for these small plants, its plan in reality has always consisted of building one big complex of 120 connected plants, which entailed immense regulatory risks, as noted both by potential investors and by the *Blusun* tribunal.521 Italy notes, in this regard, the contradictions between Eskosol\u2019s story in this proceeding and that told by the claimants in the *Blusun* case.522\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 229.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 232 (citing Bacchiocchi).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 233.\n\nResp.

PHB, \u00b6 23.\n\n353.\n\nIn summary, relying on *Plama,* Italy argues that Eskosol\u2019s lack of success with investors \"falls squarely under the category of business risk.\"524 The case is thus completely different in its view from those on which Eskosol relies, such as *Inmaris* (where the host State banned the investor from using its investment altogether) and *Lemire* (where the host State made it illegal for the investor to operate its business), in both cases the State thereby having directly caused the subsequent loss of profits.525 Unlike those cases, Italy suggests, here the Tribunal should reach the same conclusions as the *Blusun* tribunal, namely that:\n\nIn a context in which Blusun\u2019s failure to construct the plants or to connect them to the grid was due to its own investment decisions, notably its failure to attract adequate finance, Italy should not be required to pick up the tab for Blusun\u2019s failures.526\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 259-261 (citing *Plama,* CL-119, \u00b6 30).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 262-263 (quoting *Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 407).\n\n**c. Eskosol\u2019s failure to qualify for the FiT incentives**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nOne of Italy\u2019s core arguments is that Eskosol \"cannot claim to have made the investment based on expectations regarding the persistence of a *future* opportunity to acquire some rights. The expectation that certain rights be maintained and respected is at the core of the FET standard. The expectation to acquire specific rights in the *future* is not.\"527\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 281 (emphasis in original); *see also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 262-265.\n\n355.\n\nAs noted above, Italy emphasizes that in this case, Eskosol never acquired rights to the Conto Energia III benefits, because it never complied with the legal requirements set by the law: \"[i]t had no legitimate expectations upon which it could claim to have made its investment.\"528 That distinction is important under the jurisprudence, which not only provides that \"legitimate expectations must be assessed at the time of the making of the investment,\" but also recognizes that expectations with respect to some benefits arises only when the investor has complied with the requirements to obtain those benefits.529 In this case, Italy argues, \"at the time in which Claimant made the investment (or at no other time) Eskosol did not qualify for the benefits, nor was the receiving of the benefits imminent or even expectable with any certainty. The change in regulations affected Eskosol\u2019s putative plans but did not deteriorate its rights, nor did it frustrate any specific expectation backed by Italy\u2019s reassurance.\"530 According to Italy, Eskosol was never in the position to fulfil the stipulated conditions to access a promised benefit, so this case is not about the unexpected removal or diminution of such benefits, or about a change in the requirements to access them. Rather, Eskosol \"has not complied with the conditions prevailing at the time of making the investment.\"531\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 286; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 260-261.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 258.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 258.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 259.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID ARB/14/1, Award, 16 May 2018, RL-90 (\"*Masdar*\"), where the tribunal found a breach of legitimate expectations related to benefits that the investor already had acquired by complying with the necessary requirements (*see* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 255-256).\n\n356.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Italy clarified that it does not suggest that because the Eskosol Project did not come to fruition, Eskosol was not a protected investor. Rather, Italy\u2019s argument is that \"Claimant\u2019s investment consisted of its assets and its development plan for a solar field, minus its actual construction. It certainly did not consist of a solar field with operating plants.\"532 Italy adds that:\n\n[t]he investment, as a whole, as a process, existed and was protected under the ECT. It never developed as Claimant intended and never qualified for some available benefits. These benefits were never discontinued, and even after their window of availability was shortened, Claimant\u2019s investment still did not qualify for them, or for any subsequent one....

The lack of any promise that regulations would not change**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nIn Italy\u2019s view, \"[a] State\u2019s regulatory autonomy is particularly pronounced with respect to general regulatory measures, as opposed to specific acts and decisions addressing one investor.\"534 It argues that, unlike the facts in certain other investor-state disputes, Italy made no promise to Eskosol that its laws would not change. In these circumstances, Italy invites the Tribunal to agree with the finding in *Blusun* that \"a reasonable market expectation as to some state of affairs, justified or not, is not a basis for shifting risks to the public sector, i.e. the state budget.\"535\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 287.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 288 (citing *Blusun,* RL-56, \u00b6 373); *see also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 267.\n\n358.\n\nItaly argues that Conto Energia III contained no guarantee against regulatory change. The 14-month deadline included in Conto Energia III governed the application of the incentives, not the validity or effectiveness of the decree. As long as Conto Energia III contained a deadline for obtaining its benefits, applications for incentives needed to comply with that deadline. The tariff deadline did not freeze Italy\u2019s regulatory measure; it was not a promise that Conto Energia III could not change or be repealed until May 2012.536\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 290; *see also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 268-269, 278, 281.\n\n359.\n\nItaly further contends that the \"primary function of the sunset clause was... to prevent regulatory voids. It was assumed that, as it regularly happened, the regulator would pass a new scheme every time the previous one run [sic] its course. Yet, the sunset clauses allowed the government to operate with ease, rather than having to rush with no notice to preserve the continuity of the incentives.\"537 Italy further notes that Conto Energia III previously cut short the sunset period of Conto Energia II, so Eskosol could have had no legitimate expectation that the Conto Energia III sunset period could never be affected by future regulation.538 Moreover, the extension of the incentives for some plants under the Salva Alcoa law was until 30 June 2011, still earlier than the original sunset clause.539 In Italy\u2019s view, these prior changes to the periods over which certain provisions would apply demonstrated that the adoption of Conto Energia IV, and the disposal of the sunset provision in Conto Energia III, were neither unprecedented nor impossible to have previously contemplated.540\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 270.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 274-275 (explaining that the 1,200 MW ceiling under Conto Energia II was reached on 30 June 2010, and the 14-month period should have lasted until 30 August 2011, whereas Conto Energia III applied to plants commissioned on or after 1 January 2011).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 276-277.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 280.\n\n360.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Italy further explained that,\n\n[t]hrough [the Salva Alcoa Law] Italy then permitted to apply the tariffs of *Conto Energia II* also to plants still concluded by the end of 2010... but connected after that date and before 30th June 2011. Indeed, many investors only needed to be connected to become operational... since delays in connections had occurred due to the extremely high request.\n\nThe same logics and legislative technique between Conto Energia II and Conto Energia III applies to the transition from Conto Energia III to Conto Energia IV:\n\n- It indicated a target of 8,000 MW by 2020 and a cap of 3,000 MW maximum PV plant\u2019s power being allowed to apply for incentives;\n\n- It set a 14-month period application of the Conto for plant[s] entered into operation after the reaching of such target.\n\nFor the same reasons as for Conto Energia II, the 14-month extension would have been applicable only in the absence of a new decree adopting new tariffs.\n\nThe cumulative power incentivized by the end of 2010 under Conto Energia I and II was about 3,500 MW. In addition, GSE reached over 55,000 requests to access the *Salva Alcoa* regime, corresponding approximately to further 3,500 MW to be installed by the end of 2010 and ready to be connected before June 2011.541\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 94-97.\n\n361.\n\nItaly contends that \"nothing in Conto Energia III can be construed as Italy\u2019s promise not to change the regulatory framework governing tariff incentives. Decreto Romani and Conto Energia IV could, and did, modify some aspects of the \u2018regulatory framework,\u2019 never retroactively.\"542 In Italy\u2019s view, Eskosol\u2019s mere reliance on the deadline to apply for Conto Energia III incentives cannot prevail over the common knowledge that incentives schemes are subject to constant revision and that laws can change. Italy invokes the *Blusun* finding that any expectations would be \"even less powerful because European law had already lowered them: it was clear that the incentives offered were subject to modification in light, *inter alia*, of changing costs and improved technology.\"543\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 292-293.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 295-296; *see also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 283.\n\n362.\n\nItaly argues in the alternative that even if this Tribunal considered Conto Energia III as signaling an intention not to change the law for a period of time, at most this would be a commitment of a general nature, as opposed to one addressed specifically to Eskosol or its investment. Italy says, quoting *Blusun,* that Eskosol\u2019s argument \"has the effect of treating the law as not a general command but an individual commitment.\"544\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 297 (citing *Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 371). Italy also relies on *Philip Morris*, RL-66, \u00b6 426, and UNCTAD, *Fair and Equitable Treatment*, UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II (2012), p. 69 (cited in *Isolux*, RL-60, \u00b6 775) (citations omitted)).\n\n363.\n\nThe only specific interaction between Italy and Eskosol was a letter dated 3 December 2010, in which \"the agency limited itself to state that it \u2018believe[d]\u2019 access to the incentives was possible, \u2018if the... plants... meet all the requirements, also technical as set forth by applicable law,\u2019 and \u2018pursuant to the applicable provisions of law.\u2019\"545 Eskosol\u2019s problem is that it never met all the requirements provided by the law, which included the commissioning of the plants. The applicable provisions of law changed, but Eskosol had not met the ones previously applicable. \"At no time did [Eskosol] receive specific assurance that its plants would benefit from a specific FiT scheme.\"546 Moreover, Italy states that the GSE\u2019s task is to implement legislative and regulatory measures, but it can never give reassurance on the validity or duration of any such measures.547\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 300.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 301.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 302.\n\n**e. The predictability and reasonableness of the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nItaly argues that Eskosol\u2019s shareholders knew that incentive tariffs were (and inevitably would continue to be) on a downward trend, and the reference in its measures to a specific cap on incentives conveyed a relatively clear message that if growth were faster than expected, Italy would have to take urgent steps to address the situation.548 As noted by Italy,\n\nthe regulator\u2019s plan was clear at all stages; the applicable rules would be adjusted periodically to reduce the costs for the final consumers, by introducing control mechanisms of incentive spending and by promoting the use of more cost effective technologies (i.e., with cheaper cost per unit, in particular for solar panels)....\n\nAs specifically for the Romani Decree, substituting *Conto Energia III* with *Conto Energia IV*, this was adopted in the specific context of implementing a new EU directive and in a conjuncture where thresholds had been exceeded extremely quickly. This adjustment was made by providing a specific transitional scheme.549\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 307-308 (citing Mr. Lecorcier's written testimony in the *Blusun* case, R-50, \u00b6 33; and *Isolux*, RL-60, \u00b6 781 (citation omitted)); *see also* Resp.

This is because the adjustment was gradual; it was accompanied by principled reasoning tying the changes to concerns to safeguard legitimate public interests; plants that were about to be completed still could benefit from the Conto Energia III incentives until May 2011; and Conto Energia IV was still available, albeit with slightly lower tariffs, for those who could not make that deadline.552\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 305-306.\n\n367.\n\nItaly argues that the Conto Energia schemes \"were intended to strike a specific balance between the incentive to production and a fair remuneration of the investments. Over-remuneration was not their goal, and constant adjustment was universally anticipated.\"553 As for the Romani Decree, this was motivated by the unexpectedly quick achievement of the target set in Conto Energia III. Italy indicates that the peak in the growth of subsidies was between 2010-2013, with subsidies paid by consumers to producers growing in this period from \u20ac0.9 billion to \u20ac6.7 billion.554 Italy also states that in the period 2010-2012, the national aggregate operating power from PV plants rose from 1,906 MW to 10,796 MW (+466.42%), and by the end of 2012 it grew further to 19,862 (an additional 74.71%), for a total increase of 889.61% on a two-year basis.555 According to Italy, the 11.4 TWh production projected for 2020 was already surpassed in 2012.556 In fact, Conto Energia IV was the most successful Conto Energia of all in terms of plants installed and receiving the benefits.557\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 289.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 290.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 294-295.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 296.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 298; *see also* Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 97-99.\n\n368.\n\nItaly further states that:\n\nIn January 2011, GSE communicated to the Parliament *(Senate)* that it estimated the power plant installed at the end of 2010 having already reached the power of 7,000 MW. Those expectations were right since the threshold of 8,000 MW incentivized was reached between May and June 2011. In fact, we know that at the end of 2011, the operating power was greater than 13,000 MW.\n\nOn the other side, no claim in this regard could be opposed to Italy in relation to the fact that the legislator did not wait for the achievement of the cap of 3,000 MW set by *Conto Energia III* since:\n\nas mentioned, the overall target of 8,000 Mw set by the *Conto Energia III* had already been reached;\n\neven assuming that the *Conto* would remain in force until the cap of 3,000 MW be reached, the Claimant would not have received any benefits, given that:\n\ni. having regard to the entry into operation of the *Salva Alcoa* plants to 31st May 2011, the date on which the *Conto Energia III* ceased to apply, the cumulative power incentivized and installed in 2011 (Third *Conto* + *Salva Alcoa)* was well above the limit of 3,000 MW provided by the *Conto;*\n\nii. In any case, even under the - wrong - assumption of not considering Salva Alcoa plants, the additional 1,500 MW required to achieve the target of 3,000 MW had been installed between July and August 2011, under *Conto Energia IV*.\n\niii. Under no perspective the Claimant could thus have been able to rely on the applicability of *Conto Energia III* tariffs until mid 2012. That such cap would have been reached by that time was clear to anyone following the publicly available data on the trend of the market.558\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.\n\n369.\n\nItaly also rejects Eskosol\u2019s suggestion that the later (higher) target of 23,000 MW in Conto Energia IV demonstrates any inconsistency in Italy\u2019s conduct. In its view, the higher target goes hand in hand with the lower incentives.559 As for the criticism from the European Commission to which Eskosol refers, Italy contends that it was completely superseded by subsequent events, including the fact that the infringement procedure against the Romani Decree was ultimately dropped.560\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 300.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 301, 303-304 (citing press release from the European Commission \"certifying that Italy had fully and correctly implemented Directive 2009/28/EC\").\n\n**f. Other aspects of Eskosol\u2019s FET claim**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nWith respect to Eskosol\u2019s argument that Italy breached its FET obligation by failing to provide a stable and predictable legal framework, failing to act transparently or consistently, and adopting arbitrary, unreasonable and disproportionate measures, Italy challenges Eskosol\u2019s reliance on *Occidental*, *CME*, *Metalclad*, *Tecmed*, *ELSI* and *Plama* on the basis that these cases involved abusive and targeted measures against specific investors.561 In its view, they do not assist Eskosol here, because\n\nthe regulatory changes made by [Italy] were gradual and reasonable. These changes occurred while Italy looked after the updating of the incentive schemes to developments occurring in the photovoltaic industry, financial and technological alike. All Italian measures pursued public interests; none of them was discriminatory, disproportionate or unreasonable.562\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 316-320 (citing *Occidental*, CL-116, \u00b6\u00b6 184, 191; *CME Czech Republic B.V. v.

But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.563\n\n*Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 319.\n\n372.\n\nItaly says that \"it was plausible to anticipate\" that the Conto Energia III incentives might be adjusted in the light of the rapid pace at which Italy was reaching its target of 8,000 MW of cumulative power from photovoltaic energy, which was expected to be achieved by 2020. According to Italy, by 2010 that objective was almost half reached, which forced the Government to anticipate the expiry of Conto Energia III. Moreover, those plants that were able to qualify within the next three months were left unaffected by the regulatory change.564\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 327, 341.\n\n373.\n\nWith respect to Eskosol\u2019s contentions about a state of legal uncertainty existing between 3 March 2011 (the Romani Decree) and 19 April 2011 (when the \"salient aspects\" of the forthcoming Conto Energia IV were announced), Italy rejects the argument that any lack of clarity violated its treaty obligations. In its view, \"Italy cannot be faulted for failing to preview the content of future laws so long in advance of their application.\"565 Moreover, the Romani Decree foresaw a transitional period of more than a year after its publication to alleviate the impact on a category of investors (those who already had construction permits) that would actually be disadvantaged by the change, as they no longer would meet the new requirements on the use of agricultural land.566\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 329.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 330.\n\n374.\n\nAs to Conto Energia IV, Italy contends that it actually improved the incentives scheme in several respects, particularly in their overall transparency, by establishing a register with the GSE recording the plants that would receive benefits.567 Moreover, Italy argues that the lowered tariffs of Conto Energia IV were \"roughly predictable\" if one had projected the decreasing trend of tariff levels across the various Conto Energia decrees, and Conto Energia IV did not affect the plants that already qualified for earlier incentives, as the new levels were limited to future applicants.568\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 331-332 (citing Messrs.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis577**\n-----------------------------\n\n**a. Introductory Points**\n--------------------------\n\n379.\n\nA significant portion of the Parties\u2019 pleadings and arguments has been focused on the issue of causation, namely whether Eskosol would have been able to obtain the necessary funding to construct and complete its ambitious project, but for the State measures challenged in this case (the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV). Italy argued that the project was inherently risky because of Eskosol\u2019s own business choices, whereas Eskosol argued that the project had a clear path to success until Italy dramatically changed the regulatory regime on which Eskosol\u2019s business plan was based.\n\n380.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this debate is the proverbial \"wrong end of the telescope\": it is not the place to start in any resolution of this dispute. The issue of causation logically becomes relevant only if a breach of duty is first shown. If a State has not violated its treaty obligations with respect to a particular investor and investment, then it does not matter what consequences the State\u2019s non-wrongful action may have had for a particular business project. The Tribunal therefore starts with Eskosol\u2019s allegations of an ECT breach, with particular reference here to its claim that by enacting the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, Italy violated its duty under ECT Article 10(1) to \"encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area,\" which \"conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\n381.\n\nAs the Parties\u2019 submissions recognize, the fair and equitable treatment standard has been interpreted as involving several different elements, which may take on differing degrees of importance in different disputes, depending on the facts and the nature of the wrongs alleged. In this case, there has been no allegation that the Government\u2019s measures in question were targeted at a particular investor or investment, nor that they were intended to abuse or harass, nor that they were discriminatory. Rather, it appears as common ground that both the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV were general enactments intended to apply to an entire industry sector. That is an important starting point for the analysis, because it eliminates various factors that can be critical in other cases to an evaluation of FET claims.\n\n382.\n\nNonetheless, the fact that the challenged measures were general industry-wide measures, not targeted at any investor and not intended to abuse, harass or discriminate, does not end the FET analysis. Eskosol contends that the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV nonetheless violated Italy\u2019s obligations under ECT Article 10(1) because they allegedly violated its legitimate expectations; were inconsistent with Italy\u2019s obligations to provide a stable and consistent framework for investments; and were arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and non-transparent.\n\n383.\n\nThese various contentions could be analyzed in any sequence. However, in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to start not with the specifics of Eskosol\u2019s investment (*e.g.*, the question of its legitimate expectations), but rather at the macro-level, with Eskosol\u2019s arguments about Italy\u2019s alleged arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and non-transparent acts. Only after grappling with those questions about the measures in general does it make sense to proceed to the issues involving regulatory stability, consistency and legitimate expectations, which examine whether - even if the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV in and of themselves were not problematic under the ECT - Eskosol nonetheless might be entitled to protection against the changes they introduced to the previously applicable tariff regime. In that context, the Tribunal examines both Eskosol\u2019s general claim about Italy\u2019s duty to provide a stable and consistent framework for investments, and its claim that it had legitimate expectations to be able to benefit from the Conto Energia III regime, either because of assurances that it allegedly received from various Government sources, or in consequence of the terms of Conto Energia III itself.\n\n**b. Alleged Arbitrary and Unreasonable Conduct**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nApplying this sequence of analysis, the Tribunal begins with Eskosol\u2019s claim that the Romani Decree and Conto Energy IV were arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\n385.\n\nTo give meaning to this standard, Eskosol invokes the ICJ\u2019s definition in *ELSI,* according to which \"arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law.... It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.\"578 Eskosol also notes the *Plama* definition of arbitrary or unreasonable measures as \"those which are not founded in reason or fact but on caprice, prejudice or personal preference.\"579 Italy does not quarrel with these definitions,580 and the Tribunal considers them appropriate as well. It equally notes the helpful definition offered in *AES,* which examines first \"the existence of a rational policy,\" which is one \"taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter,\" and second whether the challenged act was itself reasonably related to the policy, in the sense of \"an appropriate correlation between the state\u2019s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it.\"581 As otherwise stated by the *El Paso* tribunal, citing both *ELSI* and ordinary dictionary definitions of the word \"arbitrary,\"582 \"there are always several methods for dealing\" with challenging circumstances in a country, but the issue of arbitrariness examines not \"whether the measures taken were or were not the best,\" but simply whether they were \"based on a reasoned scheme\" that was itself reasonably connected to \"the aim pursued.\"583\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 318 (quoting *ELSI*, CL-120, \u00b6 128).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 317 (quoting *Plama*, CL-119, \u00b6 184).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 318.\n\n*AES*, CL-81/RL-82, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.7-10.3.9; *see similarly Saluka*, CL-56, \u00b6 460 (examining whether State conduct \"bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy\").\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6 319.\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6\u00b6 320-322, 325.\n\n386.\n\nIn this regard, Eskosol\u2019s first basis for claiming that the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV were arbitrary and unreasonable is that they allegedly were adopted on a pretext, as a favor to the nuclear power industry rather than from a true concern about managing the unexpectedly rapid growth of the country\u2019s PV energy sector in response to generous incentive policies.584 Legally, an allegation that a State acted on a pretext is close to alleging that it acted in bad faith, because the concept is that the State used legal instruments for purposes other than those for which they ostensibly were created. For obvious reasons, a party seeking to demonstrate that a State acted for ulterior motives, and thus not on the basis of its stated public policy rationale, bears the burden to so demonstrate. In this case, however, Eskosol has presented little if any cognizable evidence to support its claim. Its witness Mr. Magli alludes to \"common knowledge amongst the Italian public that the change of heart in respect of the solar PV industry was due to \u2018political\u2019 reasons and had nothing to do with an excessive renewable energy capacity,\" and its witness Mr. Scognamiglio refers to what \"later became known to the public\" regarding \"motivat[ion] by the pressure of the nuclear lobby.\"585 These general allusions to \"common knowledge\" and \"public\" knowledge hardly qualify as evidence. The only other evidence Eskosol cites in support of an ostensible ulterior motive is the statement of EU official Mr. Claude Turmes that the Romani Decree \"is a huge and unacceptable gift made to the nuclear lobby.\"586 It is not clear whether Mr. Turmes meant to imply that this was the State\u2019s motivation for the measure, or simply that the nuclear industry stood to benefit from it, but in any event, Claimant presents no evidence to support Mr. Turmes\u2019 opinion or otherwise to prove pretextual conduct.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 322-323.\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 35; Scognamiglio I, \u00b6 49; *see also id.*, \u00b6 50 (suggesting that the challenged measures were \"significantly influenced\" by the State's attempt to introduce nuclear energy, until the Fukushima nuclear disaster turned the Italian public further against construction of nuclear power plants).\n\n*See* Memorial, \u00b6 330 (quoting C-83).\n\n387.\n\nIn any event, by the end of the Hearing, it was not clear that Eskosol even maintained its allegation about ulterior motives to assist the nuclear energy industry. After making this pretext allegation in its Memorial, Eskosol barely returned to the assertion in its Reply, alleging only that Italy\u2019s stated concern about too much incentivized energy entering the market too soon was \"in fact a cover-up for *whatever its real motive may have been*.\"587 Eskosol did not reference the nuclear industry allegation at all in its Post-Hearing Brief, which instead contended that \"the key reason\" for the early end of Conto Energia III \"was to deal with the unexpected consequence of the Salva Alcoa act, [which] created a huge and unexpected amount of FiTs.\"588\n\nReply, \u00b6 146 (emphasis added). Eskosol did chide Italy in a footnote for not responding to the allegedly \"abundant evidence that favoritism of the nuclear industry influenced the sudden end of Conto Energia III,\" but it cited no such evidence, abundant or otherwise. *Id.*, n. 291.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 174; *see also id.*, \u00b6 18 (stating that \"witness testimony confirmed\" this was \"the key reason\"), \u00b6 183 (stating that \"[a]ll the contemporary evidence\" demonstrates that the new measures were \"in response to the problems associated with the Salva Alcoa Act\").\n\n388.\n\nEskosol\u2019s second basis for alleging that Italy acted arbitrarily, in the sense that \"it failed to pursue a legitimate objective,\"589 is that Italy justified the new limitations on accessing Conto Energia III incentives by referring to excessive (and excessively rapid) growth in the PV sector - for example, predicting in January 2011 that the National Action Plan\u2019s 2020 target of 8,000 MW \"might be reached towards the end of 2011\" - while in reality, (i) these predictions \"were incorrect\" (because as of February 2011, only 3,730 MW had been connected to the grid),590 and (ii) soon afterwards, Conto Energia IV raised the objective to 23,000 MW by 2016, an increase which \"plainly belies the earlier erroneous statements\" that PV sector growth was too rapid and needed to be curbed.591\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 321.\n\nEskosol also cites certain April 2011 statistics as evidence that the GSE's January 2011 predictions for the year \"were not accurate.\" Reply, \u00b6 139 (citing C-111, which reported that as of 20 April 2011, total nominal capacity in operation was 4,550 MW, with another 2,400 MW expected to enter in operation by the end of June 2011).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 321-323; Reply, \u00b6 143.\n\n389.\n\nTaking these arguments in turn, the Tribunal notes (as to the former) that a putative error by regulators or legislators in predicting how quickly additional PV plants might come online during 2011 (*i.e.,* whether the 8,000 MW target was likely to be reached that year) would not itself render illegitimate a policy objective of controlling growth, or render irrational actions taken in support of that policy goal. Just as good faith errors about existing facts do not amount to arbitrary or irrational conduct, an inaccurate but good faith prediction of future events -particularly one made in a highly dynamic environment - is hardly evidence of conduct founded in caprice rather than in reason or honest belief. In this case, there is no basis to believe that the GSE\u2019s projections in January 2011, about the amount of total installed PV capacity likely to have come into operation by the end of 2011, were made in anything other than good faith. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the January 2011 predictions for the end of 2011 were *if anything on the low side,* because as it turned out, Italy\u2019s total installed PV capacity was almost 13,000 MW by the end of 2011.592 The fact that a significant portion of the rapid growth may have resulted from the Salva Alcoa Act, which provided a window for plants coming into operation in early 2011 to still qualify for Conto Energia II FiTs (rather than Conto Energia III), does not affect the arbitrariness analysis. Whatever the reason for the trends, it was not arbitrary for Italy to acknowledge their existence, nor to consider them relevant to its assessment of the need for (or timing of) further regulatory adjustments.\n\n*See* International Energy Agency, \"Energy Policies of IEA countries, Italy, 2016 Review,\" R-47; Bacchiocchi, \u00b6 33; Delfanti/Motta, pp. 73, 98 (referencing GSE statistics reporting a total 12,774 MW of PV power in operation at the end of 2011, of which more than 9,304 MW entered into operation in that year alone).\n\n390.\n\nEskosol\u2019s second argument - that it was irrational for Italy to decry the rapid achievement of the prior 8,000 MW target, and then shortly afterwards declare a substantially increased target of 23,000 MW - deserves greater attention. The difficulty here is that Eskosol oversimplifies the policy objective that underlay all of Italy\u2019s Conto Energy schemes, including the earlier ones on which Eskosol claims to have relied. The evidence is clear that the policy goal was not simply unidimensional, to achieve a *particular volume* of PV capacity by means of financial incentives. Rather, the incentive program from the outset was more nuanced, involving the interaction of at least three related policy objectives: (i) *increasing PV capacity,* (ii) doing so by means of long-term subsidies over market pricing, which would ensure sector investors an overall \"*fair return*\" (over the projected life of a given PV plant) on the costs they incurred in building and operating that new PV plant, but with the expectation that such *costs gradually would decrease* for new plants coming online, with the promotion of more cost-effective technologies, and (iii) *managing the burden* of these tariff subsidies on electricity consumers, since incentive payments to plant operators ultimately were to be factored in to electricity prices by way of a surcharge embedded in user accounts.\n\n391.\n\nThat these three policy objectives were interrelated from the outset is clear on the face of the prior enactments on which Eskosol claims it relies in formulating its own investment plan. For example, starting with Italy\u2019s Legislative Decree No. 387 of 29 December 2003, it was expressly mandated that the incentivizing tariffs be offered \"*without any cost to the State budget*,\"593 meaning that the costs would be passed on to electricity consumers.594 It was equally clear that tariff levels were to reflect cost expectations, with levels maintained for \"a duration that ensures a *fair return* on the investment and operating costs\" for plants coming into operation at a given time, but over time, with the tariffs offered to subsequent plants being of a *\"decreasing nature,*\"595 presumably to reflect expected declines in solar panel costs and also the State\u2019s diminishing need to provide subsidies over market pricing to support sector growth.\n\nLegislative Decree No. 387, CL-94, Art. 7(1) (emphasis added).\n\nEskosol's witnesses clearly understood that the costs of the subsidy program were to be borne by consumers. *See* Scognamiglio I*,* \u00b6 9 (\"The costs of the incentivising tariffs were to be paid by end consumers, as part of their electricity bill\"). The expert witnesses explain that this was implemented by guaranteeing preferential prices exceeding market prices, with the guests of the premium distributed to end users as an \"A3\" surcharge on their bills/ Delfanti/Motta I, pp. 40, 46, 75.\n\nLegislative Decree No. 387, CL-94, Art. 7(2)(d) (emphasis added).\n\n392.\n\nThe first two Conto Energia schemes likewise confirmed the interaction of these several policy objectives. First, Conto Energia I provided that the tariffs recognized by the decree would apply only up to a \"[m]aximum aggregate limit\" of power (originally 100 MW, later amended to 500 MW),596 and made clear that this cap on anticipated subsidy obligations had been calculated in the context of a particular national target of installed PV capacity by 2015 (originally 300 MW, later amended to 1,000 MW).597 While any given power plant qualifying for incentives by entering into operation598 was assured that its particular tariff level would be fixed for 20 years, new plants entering into operation in later years would have their 20-year fixed tariffs set at lower levels, based on the particular year in which they entered into operation.599 In this way, the scheme anticipated a gradual reduction over time in the burden passed on to Italian consumers, since the total amount of power entitled to any subsidy was capped, and the level of that subsidy would decrease over time.\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 12(1); Decree of 6 February 2006, CL-97, Arts. 1, 2(1).\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 11; Decree of 6 February 2006, CL-97, Arts. 1, 2(1).\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 4(1).\n\nConto Energia I, CL-96, Art. 6(3).\n\n393.\n\nConto Energia II likewise reflected the same basic interlocking policy objectives. It again (i) sought to increase PV capacity based on a national target for cumulative installed PV power (now set at 3,000 MW by 2016),600 (ii) by offering incentive pricing, which was still at guaranteed fixed levels for 20 years based on the date of each plant\u2019s entry into operation,601 while (iii) making clear that FiT levels would decrease over time for each later year in which new plants entered into operation,602 and (iv) that there was an anticipated limit on the volume of power that could benefit from the scheme (now set at 1,200 MW).603 One departure from Conto Energia I is that the ceiling on incentivized power was now to be implemented with some flexibility in the form of a 14-month grace period triggered when the 1,200 MW figure was reached,604 presumably so as not to abruptly disqualify plants that were close to entering into operation at that time, with a tracking mechanism introduced to facilitate awareness of progress towards achieving both the national target and the incentive ceiling of 1,200 MW.605\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 12.\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 6(1).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 6(2).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(1).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(2).\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Art. 13(3).\n\n394.\n\nFinally, and again consistent with the interlocking policy obj ectives on which Italy\u2019s incentive scheme had been based from the outset, Conto Energia II contained a very clear reminder that FiT levels in future would be based on the regulator\u2019s understanding both of (i) evolutions in PV plant cost structure (to implement the goal of a fair but not excessive return), and (ii) the cumulative burden on electricity consumers from the volume of incentives already granted. These two elements were reflected in Conto Energia II\u2019s statement that FiT levels applicable to future periods would be re-evaluated taking into account both \"the price trends of energy products and components for photovoltaic plants\" and the results of prior incentive programs, including the amount of PV energy brought online and the volume of incentives thus far extended.606\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98, Arts. 6(3), 14(1), 14(2).\n\n395.\n\nThe National Renewable Action Plan of June 2010 further confirmed that Italy\u2019s policy scheme for PV power growth included, as key parts of its intertwined objectives, \"rationalizing the current incentives based on trends in the cost of the various technologies,\" to avoid the scenario of excessive returns *(i.e.,* beyond what was needed to fairly recompense investment) at the expense of electricity consumers. These two elements were reflected in the Plan\u2019s report that there would be \"regular reviews\" of the FiT for solar energy, \"in order to take into account the *expected reduction in component and plant costs* and to expand the production base whilst *limiting and regulating the economic impact on the electricity sector*.\"607 The National Renewable Action Plan also referred to the need for \"corrections... to the existing framework... *in order to avoid a parallel increase in production and in incentive costs*,\"608 which would include a review of FiT levels \"in order to avoid *excessive or insufficient remuneration\"\"609* It described Italy\u2019s program as a \"support scheme\" which guarantees plants \"constant remuneration\" for the power they produce, but \"subject to regular adjustments which take into account the *trends in the prices of energy products and components* for photovoltaic plants... with the intention of *limiting the medium- and long-term costs to the community*.\"610\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 8 (emphasis added).\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 107 (emphasis added).\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 107.\n\nNational Renewable Action Plan, C-29, p. 112 (emphasis added).\n\n396.\n\nFinally, the same multi-faceted policy objectives were reflected in Conto Energia III, which entered into effect in August 2010, soon after the National Renewable Action Plan. The recitals expressly referenced the reduction in costs of PV technology and the importance of progressively reducing tariff levels in light of the basic tariff principle of \"fair remuneration of costs.\"611 Just as with prior iterations, Conto Energia III referred to an updated national target for cumulative installed PV power (now 8,000 MW by 2020);612 offered incentive pricing based on the date of each plant\u2019s entry into operation, at decreasing levels for later plants but with any given plant still guaranteed its particular FiT for 20 years;613 and referenced an anticipated limit on the volume of power that could benefit from the scheme (now set at 3,000 MW),614 while continuing Conto Energia II\u2019s approach of a 14-month grace period after the ceiling was met, during which new plants entering into operation still would be entitled to receive FiTs at Conto Energia III levels.615\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, p. 2.\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(1).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Arts. 8(2), 8(4).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(2).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(6); *see also* GSE, *Guide to Conto Energia III*, January 2011, C-34, \u00b6 3.\n\n397.\n\nWith Italy\u2019s policy obj ectives understood in this more nuanced context, it was hardly irrational for Italy\u2019s officials to worry in early 2011, when it became increasingly clear that past incentive payment levels had encouraged greater and faster PV plant investment than had been anticipated, at the same time as the market cost of solar panels had dramatically decreased. The point was not that Italy necessarily wanted to cap national PV power *overall* at 8,000 MW (which arguably would have been inconsistent with its announcing soon afterwards a new national target of 23,000 MW). Rather, the concern was about the potential consequences of continuing such rapid growth *without first adjusting the regulatory scheme,* to take into account the two other elements (fair but not excessive returns, and minimizing the burden on consumers) that always had been closely connected to PV capacity in the design of the policy scheme.\n\n398.\n\nItaly\u2019s policymakers apparently understood that as a matter of logic, a continued explosion of new capacity qualifying for high FiT levels would have at least two consequences. First, newer plants that were constructed at substantially lower component costs than originally anticipated - but which would still receive a 20-year stream of FiTs that had been calculated on assumptions about higher component costs - would thereby obtain higher rates of return than the \"fair return\" which the subsidy scheme had been designed to ensure. It is undisputed that the cost of PV plant equipment decreased substantially in the relevant time period, due to technological advances and economies of scale,616 and Eskosol\u2019s own witness confirmed that the cost of such equipment *(i.e.,* solar panels and associated materials) \"was one of the most expensive parts\" of such a PV plant project.617 The effect was that overall project costs substantially decreased as well. Italy\u2019s experts reported that the price of PV plants in Italy fell by 40-50% between 2007 and 2010.618 Set against an incentive scheme that guaranteed tariff rates at fixed levels over a 20-year period, such dramatically lower costs necessarily would mean dramatically higher rates of return. It was hardly irrational for Italy to take this into account in calibrating a program that, from the start, always had been based on a principle of regulated (not market-based) \"fair returns.\"\n\n*See* Bacchiocchi, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 19; *see also* DBW-8, p. 10 (Minister Romani noting that the cost of equipment had decreased by almost 50% over one year, and \"the incentive is intended to be tied to the cost of the equipment installed\").\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 28. It is uncontested that Eskosol itself never incurred such costs, because its project never reached the stage of plant construction.\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, pp. 27, 79 & Figure 7-11.\n\n399.\n\nSecond, the financial burden of providing these higher-than-anticipated returns to a larger-than-anticipated volume of PV plant beneficiaries would be borne by Italian consumers, resulting in a greater burden on consumer electricity prices than originally had been expected. Indeed, the \"A3\" surcharge on general system charges, which was added to end user bills to finance incentives for renewable energy, had become the largest component of the system charges, with its most rapid growth in 2010-2011 due to the enormous increase in installed PV power.619 Projections in late 2010 were that Conto Energia costs for end-users could increase five or six-fold in 2011 over their 2010 levels, which understandably called into question the sustainability of the mechanism.620 It was not an irrational decision for Italy\u2019s policymakers to take this \"overall societal cost\" into account, as \"a driver for updating\" the tariff schedules earlier than originally had been contemplated.621\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, pp. 75-78 & Figures 7.7-7.9.\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, p. 113; *see also* DBW-8, p. 9 (Minister Romani expressing concern that the surcharge on the average user could grow to 80 Euros more per year, to cover a total 7 billion Euro charge needed to guarantee PV incentives).\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, p. 75.\n\n400.\n\nPutting these two factors together, Italy\u2019s decision to adjust the core elements of its incentive scheme - to recalibrate provisions regulating how many new plants could qualify, in what time periods, for subsidized tariffs at what levels - cannot be said to violate the core notion of rationality as defined in the *AES* case, namely as lacking a \"logical (good sense) explanation\" aimed at \"addressing a public interest matter.\"622 To the contrary, a policy choice to rebalance the program could be seen as entirely consonant with its original objectives, which were to encourage industry growth by ensuring builders of new PV plants a fair (but not excessive) return over costs, while managing the financial burden on electricity consumers - and trying to control the pace of subsidized growth - by providing limits to the number of plants that could qualify for preferential tariffs in particular time periods.623\n\n*AES*, CL-81/RL-82, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.7-10.3.9.\n\n*See similarly Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 342(a) (finding that Italy's decision to reduce FiTs, through the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, \"was a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large take-up under the earlier Energy Accounts\").\n\n401.\n\nNor were the measures actually taken by Italy logically unrelated to such a public interest goal, in the *AES* sense of lacking \"an appropriate correlation between the state\u2019s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it.\"624 To the contrary, both the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV were expressly aimed at the stated objectives. The Romani Decree noted that one of the general criteria for encouraging renewable energy production had always been \"ensuring a fair return on investment and operating costs,\"625 and explained that the forthcoming Conto Energia IV would set new FiT levels \"taking into account the reduction in the costs of the technology and power plants.\"626 Conto Energia IV likewise emphasized \"the evolution of technology costs\" as a key reason for implementing a \"gradual reduction of the tariffs\" for new PV plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, and explained that this reduction would \"tend to align the public aid with the relevant cost of the technology.\"627 At the same time, Conto Energia IV continued to provide that any particular tariff level for which a given plant qualified, based on the date of its entry into operation, would remain constant for that plant for 20 years.628 And while the new scheme discontinued the grace period that Conto Energia III had provided, to enable plants in the development pipeline to benefit from its FiT levels so long as they came into operation within a defined period after the otherwise applicable incentive ceiling was reached, Conto Energia IV provided its own form of flexibility (albeit less generous) for qualifying for incentives. Under the new scheme, plants that were close enough to completion to be commissioned by 31 May 2011 could still benefit from the Conto Energia III incentives, and those which were able to be commissioned by 31 August 2011 could qualify for Conto Energia IV incentives through a \"direct access\" provision. As for others that were further back in development, they could sign up in advance for participation under Conto Energia IV, through a new registration process that enabled operators to enter the pipeline for incentives even before plant construction was completed.629 While construction still would have to be completed within a specified period after registration,630 the period apparently was long enough to enable a considerable number of power plants to qualify.631\n\n*AES*, CL-81/RL-82, \u00b6\u00b6 10.3.7-10.3.9.\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 24(1), (2)(a).\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(10).\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, p. 3.\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 12(2).\n\n*See* Bacchiocchi, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42; Delfanti Motta I, p. 97.\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 6(2)-(4).\n\n*See* Bacchiocchi, Table 1; Delfanti/Motta I, p. 17; Delfanti/Motta Hearing Presentation Slides, p. 6 (noting that 269 other plants below 1 MW used the registration process and ultimately were completed on time to receive the incentives).\n\n402.\n\nIn any event, while the new regulatory arrangement no doubt was more challenging than the past ones for would-be new PV plant operators, there was nothing in its terms that reflected *irrationality*, in the sense of unreasoned conduct that was not correlated to stated public interest goals. For these reasons, and putting aside for later analysis whether the change in regulatory regime violated any separate ECT obligations of legal stability owed to Eskosol, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Romani Decree or Conto Energia IV violated the prohibition on arbitrary and unreasonable conduct which is embedded in ECT Article 10(1)\u2019s provision for fair and equitable treatment. This conclusion applies with respect to two of the challenged features of the State measures, namely (i) their lowering of FiT levels for new PV plants sooner than had been anticipated under Conto Energia III, and (ii) their cutback on the grace period during which future new plants coming online could still access prior (higher) FiT levels.\n\n403.\n\nThis leaves only one further argument by Eskosol about alleged arbitrariness, which relates to the Romani Decree\u2019s separate regulation of the use of agricultural land for future PV plants - or more precisely, its limitation on which such uses of agricultural land would be entitled to qualify for incentive tariffs. Eskosol contends that it was arbitrary and unreasonable for the Romani Decree to limit access to future incentive tariffs, for new PV plants built on agricultural land, to those which occupied 10% or less of the relevant land parcels, while providing only a one-year grace period for plants occupying more of their respective parcels to still qualify by completing construction and connecting to the electrical grid. In Eskosol\u2019s view, this feature of the Romani Decree \"lacked any reasonable justification\" and was \"simply another manifestation of the Italian Government\u2019s undue attempt at thwarting Italy\u2019s solar PV industry.\"632\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 324; *see also* Reply, \u00b6 156.\n\n404.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree. Reasonable minds can differ in any country about how to balance land use for agriculture versus land use for renewable energy production, and also about whether the appropriate balance is better fostered by favoring (i) a presumably smaller number of large energy production plants that occupy a sizeable proportion of their land plots, or (ii) a presumably larger number of small energy production plants that occupy a modest proportion of their land plots. Where to draw the line necessarily is a land use policy decision. In this case, there was nothing inherently irrational (in the sense of not founded on reason) about the particular choice Italy made.\n\n405.\n\nIndeed, Conto Energia II already had expressed concern that \"the first results [of Conto Energia I] have shown... an excessive imbalance in favour of the construction of large plants,\"633 which Italy\u2019s experts explain included a substantial practice (including in the Puglia region) of developers disguising large projects as smaller ones by clustering many small plants together in adjacent plots.634 The preamble to Conto Energia II therefore expressed a goal to \"guide the diffusion process of PV technology towards applications... that allow lower usage of the territory.\"635 Despite this policy preference, however, expansion of the sector during 2010 \"show[ed] a clear development of the sector toward large scale plants, contrary to the spirit of Conto Energia II.\"636 In this context, the Romani Decree\u2019s effort to refocus future incentives on smaller PV plants, including those which left more room on their land plots for agricultural use, was arguably consistent with the earlier stated policy goals, even though it was implemented in a different way.637\n\nConto Energia II, CL-98.\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, p. 58.\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, p. 58 & n.7 (quoting Decree 19/02/2007); *see also* Delfanti/Motta I, p. 111-112 (noting that \"all revisions of Conto Energia contain the same ultimate strategic goals \u2026 [including] guiding the sector development towards applications that minimize the environmental impact and maximize the degree of diffusion (i.e. building integrated plants rather than large scale ground installations in agricultural areas)\").\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, p. 64.\n\n*See similarly Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 342(h) (finding that \"the limits on the use of agricultural lands were motivated by valid rural planning concerns\").\n\n406.\n\nIn addition, the decision to defer the effective date of the policy change, by granting a grace period of a full year during which PV plants currently in development based on prior land use parameters (no more than 50% of the land) still could qualify for incentives,638 was also rational. Eskosol\u2019s witness Mr. Magli acknowledged that \"[t]he actual construction of a PV farm is rather straightforward,\" and \"a year to build the plants would not normally be problematic.\"639 Indeed, that timetable was generally consistent with the construction schedule Siemens had anticipated in the EPC Contract.640 In consequence, the grace period the Romani Decree provided before the new land use restrictions entered into effect would seem to have been tailored to allow completion of most PV plant projects that already were in the construction phase, or otherwise were in a position promptly to commence construction.\n\n*See* Bacchiocci, \u00b6 39.\n\nMagli I, \u00b6 6; Magli II, \u00b6 35.\n\n*See* Delfanti/Motti II, pp. 7, 12-13.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that for some entrepreneurial projects that had not yet begun any plant construction, but were still at an earlier stage of development (like Eskosol\u2019s), the decision to select a one-year grace period rather than some longer period might prove fateful.641 But the fact remains that in introducing any new policy program, a temporal line (or effective date) must be drawn somewhere, and Italy\u2019s decision in this case to draw it at a one-year juncture - rather than at a hypothetically longer juncture - did not render the measure inherently arbitrary. Certainly, rationality does not require that a State phase in its new regulatory programs in such a way that every single entrepreneur, at every single stage of the development pipeline, still might be entitled to complete its project plans without adverse impact from the new regime. As the tribunal in *El Paso* remarked, the issue for arbitrariness is not \"whether the measures taken were or were not the best,\" but simply whether they were \"based on a reasoned scheme\" that was itself reasonably connected to \"the aim pursued.\"642 The Tribunal considers that standard to have been met in this case.\n\nMr. Magli admits that the impediment in Eskosol's case was not that the one-year grace period was insufficient for construction, but rather that Eskosol was not yet ready to commence construction, because its project financing was still in development and became more complicated by the new regulatory regime. *See* Magli II, \u00b6 35.\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6\u00b6 320-322, 325.\n\n**c. Alleged Disproportionate and Non-Transparent Conduct**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nIn addition to charging that the changes introduced by the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV were arbitrary and unreasonable, Eskosol argues that they were disproportionate and the result of non-transparent conduct, in violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in ECT Article 10(1).\n\n409.\n\nWith respect to proportionality, Eskosol contends that this requires State measures to be \"reasonably related and appropriately narrow to address a legitimate State interest,\"643 citing *Tecmed* also for the proposition that \"[t]here must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim sought to be realized\" by the measure in question.644 Italy in turn references proportionality in the context of quoting the *Blusun* award, which stated as follows:\n\nIn the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.645\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 326.\n\n*Tecmed*, CL-108/RL-80, \u00b6 122.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 323 (quoting *Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 319).\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts in principle that part of assessing compliance with the fair and equitable treatment standard is determining whether State measures were disproportionate, in the sense of imposing burdens on foreign investment that went far beyond what was reasonably necessary to achieve good faith public interest goals. In this case, however, the Tribunal does not agree with Eskosol that Italy violated its ECT obligations \"because [it] failed to engage... \u2018in a rational decision-making process\u2019 by considering \u2018the effect of a measure on foreign investments and a balance of the interests of the State with any burden imposed on such investments.\u2019\"646 To the contrary, while Italy did introduce changes to its incentive scheme through the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, three elements of the regulatory changes reflect that consideration was given to, and reasonable provision was made for, the interests of PV plant investors in Italy.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 328 (quoting *LG&E*, CL-109, \u00b6 158).\n\n411.\n\nFirst, the State measures left completely intact the incentive tariff regime applicable to PV plants that *already had qualified* for incentives under prior Conto Energia regimes, by entering into operation while those regimes remained in effect. The measures provided that such operating plants would continue to enjoy the exact same tariff levels that had been provided under previous regimes, for the exact same periods of time (20 years from entry into operation). Consequently, this case does not present the question at issue in certain other investment treaty cases, where tariff levels were lowered for plants already in operation. Italy did not make any such changes.\n\n412.\n\nSecond, the challenged measures each included transitional mechanisms intended to provide an opportunity for investors who were *reasonably far along* in the process of developing additional PV plants to qualify for incentive tariffs. Putting aside for separate analysis the issue of Eskosol\u2019s alleged legitimate expectation to be protected against *any* early phase-out of Conto Energia III (which will be discussed *infra),* the relevant changes introduced through the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV did not completely remove the possibility for PV plant projects still in development to qualify for participation in the State\u2019s preferential tariff program. To the contrary, the Romani Decree provided that plants entering into operation during the next three months (by the end of May 2011) - for which investors presumably already would have purchased and largely installed the relevant plant equipment - would still qualify for the tariffs provided under Conto Energia III.647 Conto Energia IV in turn provided that plants entering into operation by March 2012 would qualify for incentives, with those doing so earlier entitled to higher tariff levels than those doing so later.648 Those entering into operation by the end of August 2011 could qualify directly, without needing to pre-register,649 while those unable to meet this deadline - but still projecting eventual completion by March 2012 - could register for incentives even while construction was ongoing.650 Finally, with respect to the Romani Decree\u2019s institution of tighter limits on the diffusion of PV plants across agricultural land, the Decree provided that its new rules (limiting incentives to plants occupying no more than 10% of the parcel available) would not come into effect for a full year from its entry into force.651 It is undisputed that many entrepreneurs were able to benefit from these various transitional mechanisms.\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(9).\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Arts. 4 and 12(1), and Annex V.\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 6(2).\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 6(3).\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 10.\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts, of course, that *not all investors* developing PV plant projects would be able to bring their projects to completion in time to qualify for these transitional mechanisms. Thus, while the new measures protected both (i) those whose plants already had entered into operation, and (ii) those whose projects were reasonably nearing completion (effectively, within a year after the Romani Decree), there was (iii) a third group of investors - whose projects could not be completed within one year - who would be impacted more significantly by the regulatory changes.652 Nonetheless, the concept of disproportionality, as applied to general sector-wide measures taken in the public interest, with no targeting of a particular investor, does not require States to make provision for all pending projects at any point in the development pipeline. Stated otherwise, a State does not violate its general treaty obligation of proportionality simply because, when it provides a grace period before new regulations apply, *not all* investors will be able to meet the requirements of that grace period. The proportionality of a measure of general applicability must be evaluated in light of its overall features and impacts, and not through the narrow lens of its impact on a particular investor. In this case, the fact that Italy did provide grace period and transitional mechanisms, rather than abruptly changing its regulatory regime with no opportunity for appropriately situated investors to adapt, was itself an indicator that Italy took into account - and sought to alleviate to a reasonable degree - the potential impact of regulatory change on investors.\n\nThe Tribunal leaves aside the fact that there eventually was a further Conto Energia V, which picked up where Conto Energia IV \u2013 the last measure Eskosol challenges in this case \u2013 left off.\n\n414.\n\nFinally, the incentives offered to investors who managed to complete their PV plants within the applicable time periods were not disproportionately reduced, when considered in the context of similar reductions that Italy had periodically introduced through prior Conto Energias, and particularly in the context of the *rationale* for the additional reductions. In this context, it bears repeating that the incentive program from the beginning had expressly predicated tariff levels on the notion of a \"fair return\" over PV project costs, and made clear that tariff levels periodically would be adjusted downwards as project costs themselves decreased.653 While the adjustment was introduced in this instance earlier than originally anticipated, this was partly a consequence of a dramatic drop in PV project costs, and notably, the reduction in FiT subsidies was *proportionately less* than the corresponding drop in technology costs during 2010.654 There has been no suggestion in this case that the tariff decreases were of a magnitude to violate the notion of a \"fair return\" over project costs.\n\nIndeed, the preamble to Conto Energia III had itself referenced a decision \"to intervene in order to adjourn the incentivizing tariffs in light of the light of the positive reduction of the costs of the photovoltaic technology, and in order to respect the principle of fair remuneration of costs\" that had been established by Legislative Decree No. 387 of 2003. CL-99, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 287 (quoting Delfanti/Motta I, Figure 3-7 and Section 7.82; Delfanti/Motta II, Section 1.3); *see similarly Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 342(b) (making the same observation about proportionality, and noting that this still left Italian subsidy levels higher than those in Germany, France and Spain).\n\n415.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find a breach of ECT Article 10(1) on the basis of allegedly disproportionate conduct.\n\n416.\n\nWith respect to Eskosol\u2019s claims alleging non-transparent conduct, Eskosol relies on the *Metalclad* decision for the proposition that investors should be able to know clearly in advance \"all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made... [with] no room for doubt or uncertainty.\"655 Eskosol relies on *Tecmed* for a similar proposition, that States should act \"totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments... to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.\"656 These are sweeping propositions,657 and the Tribunal is unable to accept them in such broad terms, which would provide no room for good faith regulatory flexibility or recalibration even where a State strives to be forthcoming about its reasons for change, both through public dialogue and through clarity in its laws. The Tribunal instead sees the issue of transparency along the same lines as the *Electrabel* tribunal, which found an obligation under the ECT \"to be forthcoming with information about intended changes in policy and regulations that may significantly affect investments, so that the investor can adequately plan its investment and, if needed, engage the host State in dialogue about protecting its legitimate expectations.\"658\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 301 (quoting *Metalclad*, CL-115/RL-73, \u00b6 76).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 302 (quoting *Tecmed*, CL-108/RL-80, \u00b6 154).\n\n*See generally El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6 342 (observing that in some respects, the *Tecmed* formulation of fair and equitable treatment \"looks like a programme of good governance that no State in the world is capable of guaranteeing at all times\") (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, RL-58 (\"*Electrabel*\"), \u00b6 7.79.\n\n417.\n\nWith this understanding in mind, the Tribunal turns to Eskosol\u2019s particular complaints about transparency, which can be perceived as falling into two categories: one about the premature end of Conto Energia III, and the other about the specific incentive tariffs that would apply afterwards, under Conto Energia IV.\n\n418.\n\nWith respect to the former, Eskosol complains that it \"had no way to foresee\" that Italy would end the Conto Energia III regime early, since that ran counter to Italy\u2019s previous statements regarding the stability of the applicable legal framework.659 The Tribunal sees this complaint as closely connected to Eskosol\u2019s legitimate expectations argument, which it addresses in the next section. In essence, if an investor has a treaty right to be protected against a particular regulatory change, then the transparency analysis adds little to the analysis, addressing perhaps only how much advance notice the investor might have been provided about the changes that would violate its rights. By contrast, if an investor has no treaty right to be protected against a particular regulatory change, then the transparency analysis cannot be specific to its circumstances (including how much advance notice of the change might have been helpful for its business plans). Rather, the issue must be addressed at the more general level, including whether the State acted secretively to conceal its plans or announced those plans openly and with reasonable explanation and detail.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 304-307.\n\n419.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal finds that there was no such secrecy, but rather ample public debate before the Romani Decree was issued about the possible need to change the incentives scheme. While the Romani Decree was not issued in final form until 3 March 2011, the key factors that ultimately led to the Decree were all discussed openly by policymakers for several prior months, including the veritable explosion of new plants coming online, the fact that such plants were benefitting from an environment of dramatically reduced technology costs, and the reality that allowing these developments to continue unchecked would pose a severe burden on electricity consumers to finance incentive rates that would not be needed to ensure a fair return.660 Given this prior public debate, the Tribunal sees no transparency violation resulting from Italy\u2019s decision to end Conto Energia III early, particularly since that decision was promptly announced and also (by its terms) provided three months\u2019 advance notice before the termination of Conto Energia III would come into effect. The announcement in early March 2011 of a change that would become operative at the end of May 2011 was consistent with the obligation, recognized in *Electrabel,* for States to be \"forthcoming with information about intended changes in policy and regulations\" that might affect investments.\"661\n\n*See, e.g.,* GSE document entitled \"Hearing of 25/1/2011 \u2013 Comments of GSE on the Scheme of Law Decree Implementing Directive 2009/28/CE,\" 25 January 2011, C-82 (Senate hearing on 25 January 2011, during which the GSE noted that \"the growth of photovoltaic power plants has been too rapid,\" with the likelihood that the National Action Plan's 2020 target of 8,000 MW instead would be reached \"nine years in arrears,\" by the end of 2011; noted that \"[o]nce into operation, the above mentioned plants will accrue burdens [to consumers] over the A3 fee equal to 3 billion euro, each year for 20 years\"; and proposed \"a reduction on the capacity to be incentivized \u2026 as well as a reduction to incentivising tariffs for power plants which will come into operation \u2026 [for the] years 2012 and 2013\"); C-60(a) (Minister Romani publicly stating in late February 2011 that incentives would have to be revisited because of the accumulated cost to Italian consumers); and Third Draft of Romani Decree, C-62, Art. 23(11)(d) (28 February 2011 publication of the third draft of the Romani Decree, which included a provision for early suspension of Conto Energia III incentives, to be replaced by a new Conto Energia IV setting out \"the relevant modalities\").\n\n*Electrabel*, RL-58, \u00b6 7.79.\n\n420.\n\nEskosol\u2019s second argument is that there was a gap in time between the Romani Decree\u2019s announcement that Conto Energia III would end early, and the enactment of Conto Energia IV setting out the details of the next regime, which allegedly \"left Eskosol in legal limbo, without any ability to understand what, if any, incentives Eskosol would be able to secure under the forthcoming Conto Energia IV.\"662 This created a \"state of uncertainty\" which Eskosol says \"amounts to a failure to act transparently,\" in violation of the ECT.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 307.\n\n421.\n\nAs noted above, the Romani Decree was clear that only plants entering into operation by 31 May 2011 would be able to benefit from its incentive rates. It also made clear that the incentives applicable to plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011 would be governed by a new decree to be issued soon, but in the meantime gave notice of at least two core principles that would be reflected in the new decree, namely that there would be a \"maximum annual cumulative electric power from photovoltaic plants that can get the incentive rates,\" and that the particular tariffs would take into account \"the reduction in the costs of the technology and power plants\" and the reduction in \"the incentives applied by other Members States of the European Union.\"663 The Romani Decree anticipated that the new decree would be \"adopted... by 30 April 2011.\"664 As it transpired, a draft of Conto Energia IV was circulated on 19 April 2011,665 the decree itself was issued on 5 May 2011, and it entered into force on 12 May 2011.666\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(10).\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(10).\n\nDelfanti/Motta I, p. 108.\n\nConto Energia IV, CL-100; Joint Chronology, p. 4.\n\n422.\n\nIn other words, the gap between the Romani Decree\u2019s announcement that incentive tariffs would be reduced for new plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, and Conto Energia IV\u2019s final identification of precisely what the new rates would be,667 was essentially two months, even if one does not account for the earlier release of a draft of the new decree. The Tribunal has no doubt that during those two months, investors in the process of developing new plants experienced a state of uncertainty. Nonetheless, the fact that Italy took two months to roll out the details of the new regulation, after having previously announced its general principles, is far from sufficient to amount to a violation of any ECT requirements of transparency.\n\nItaly suggests that the ultimate tariff levels of Conto Energia IV were \"roughly predictable\" based on projections from decreasing tariff levels across prior Conto Energia decrees. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 333-334. The Tribunal does not rely on this point for its conclusions regarding transparency, since during the two-month period, investors could not have been certain that the next reductions would be proportionately in line with the prior ones.\n\n**d. Alleged Violation of Legitimate Expectations Regarding Stability and Consistency**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not consider that the particular changes Italy introduced to its incentive tariff scheme in 2011 constituted, in and of themselves, either arbitrary and unreasonable conduct, disproportionate conduct or non-transparent conduct, in violation of its fair and equitable treatment obligations in Article 10(1) of the ECT. However, this leaves still to be examined the separate question of whether, simply by ending Conto Energia III early and replacing it with a less beneficial scheme, Italy violated Eskosol\u2019s alleged legitimate expectations regarding stability and consistency of the legal regime. Specifically, Eskosol argues that it had a legitimate expectation that Conto Energia III would remain in effect for as long as its terms provide, and accordingly that Eskosol would have additional time to complete its planned project and try to qualify for the Conto Energia III tariff regime.\n\n424.\n\nEskosol alleges several different bases for such legitimate expectations, which the Tribunal examines in the following sequence: (i) that representations and assurances were made *directly to it,* by Undersecretary Saglia and by the GSE; (ii) that *public statements* by Italian officials constituted representations and assurances to the investor community more generally; and (iii) that in any event, the *specific terms of Conto Energia III* gave rise to legitimate expectations, by referring expressly to the conditions for its termination (3,000 MW of incentives) and providing for an additional 14-month grace period thereafter for new plants to obtain Conto Energia III incentives. Separately, with respect to the issue of use of agricultural land for PV plant development, Eskosol claims (iv) a general legitimate expectation that prior land use regulations would not be changed on a timetable that would render its land development plans (and related investments) inoperative. The Tribunal addresses these issues below.\n\n***i. Statements directly to Eskosol***\n---------------------------------------\n\n425.\n\nWith respect to the first issue - alleged representations and assurances made directly by State officials to Eskosol - the issue for determination is not really one of law, but rather one of fact. It is well established that when a \"specific commitment\" has been made to a particular investor regarding the legal framework applicable to its investment, changes in that framework can give rise to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, provided the investor has relied on that commitment to make investments protected by the treaty. As the *El Paso* tribunal explained, \"the FET standard can be breached if there is a violation of a specific commitment,\" in the sense of a commitment \"directly made to the investor,\" for example in a letter of intent or \"through a specific promise in a person-to-person business meeting.\"668\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6\u00b6 375-376, 403.\n\n426.\n\nIn this case, Eskosol points to several alleged instances during which \"the Italian Government made specific representations to Eskosol about the availability and guaranteed access to the incentivizing tariff scheme.\"669 First, Eskosol alleges that Undersecretary Saglia gave certain oral assurances to Mr. Scognamiglio during several meetings in 2010.670 Eskosol\u2019s sole evidence for this assertion is Mr. Scognamiglio\u2019s witness statement, which states very generally that during one meeting, Undersecretary Saglia \"made it very clear to me that Italy was committed to keeping a stable environment for the investment in the solar PV sector and that it would not follow Spain\u2019s example.\" No date is provided for this meeting, other than that one of Mr. Scognamiglio\u2019s meetings with Undersecretary Saglia was during May of 2010.671 No further information is provided regarding the subject of the meeting, the length or specificity of the discussion, or the context of this particular (very general) statement about a \"stable environment.\" Eskosol presents no contemporaneous written records to document the assurances allegedly provided. Mr. Scognamiglio then refers to a second meeting with Undersecretary Saglia in mid-November 2010, shortly after Spain made significant cuts to the FiTs it offered to PV energy producers, during which \"[w]e received a shake of hands from Undersecretary Saglia, and he said \u2018Eskosol\u2019s investment is welcome in Italy.\u2019\"672 Again, no contemporaneous written evidence is provided to document either of the fact of the meeting, the fact of the statement by Undersecretary Saglia, or the specific context in which the (very general) oral statement was provided. In other words, the only evidence presented to the Tribunal to support Eskosol\u2019s claim that these meetings conveyed \"specific representations... about the availability and guaranteed access to the incentivizing tariff scheme\"673 consists of uncorroborated assertions by a single witness, of oral discussions with a single Government official, which on Eskosol\u2019s own case remained at an extremely high level of generality and which it never troubled at the time to document as particularly important to its decision to invest.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 281.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 281.\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6 24.\n\nScognamiglio I, \u00b6 39.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 281.\n\n427.\n\nEskosol\u2019s only other evidence of supposed specific representations directed to it individually is a letter from the GSE dated 3 December 2010, in which the GSE stated that \"if the power plants\" Eskosol planned to construct \"meet all the requirements, also technical as set forth by applicable law,... we believe that it is possible to secure access to the incentives set forth in the so-called Conto Energia, pursuant to the applicable provisions of law.\"674 Eskosol characterizes this letter as an assurance that Eskosol would be able to secure access to the Conto Energia III tariffs,675 but in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the GSE\u2019s letter does not say what Eskosol reads it as saying. Rather, the letter can be seen as a fairly cautious statement that made no commitments, but rather simply opined that the GSE expected the laws in force would be applicable to those who met their requirements.676 The GSE letter cannot be seen as a representation (much less a guarantee) that the applicable laws would not change, nor would it be reasonable for Eskosol to expect a regulatory body like the GSE even to be in a position to offer such a guarantee, when the applicable regime was based on ministerial decrees and not on regulatory discretion.\n\nLetter from GSE to Watson, Farley & Williams, 3 December 2010, C-35.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 282.\n\nItaly characterizes the GSE letter this way: \"The amount of caveats in this short declaration is almost comical: obviously, for those subjects meeting the legal requirement and observing the law, then GSE *believed* securing the benefits was \u2018possible.'\" Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 300 (emphasis in original).\n\n428.\n\nIt is equally notable what Eskosol does not claim any Italian official ever said to it. There is no suggestion that any official ever pledged that Eskosol would receive any particular incentive tariffs for its plants.677 Given that Eskosol had *not even begun building* any of these plants - indeed, at the time of these alleged conversations and the GSE letter, it had not even signed the EPC Contract arranging for construction to start - it is hard to imagine how any State official would have been in the position to make any such guarantees. Nor does Eskosol allege that any State official ever assured it that Italian laws would not change, at any time before Eskosol managed to complete its financing and construction work and reach a position of actually being able to enter into operation. Italy for its part denies that its officials ever \"made any unilateral promise to Claimant that its laws would not change.\"678\n\n*See similarly Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 380 (finding that \"[a]t no stage did the Claimants obtain unconditional assurances from the central Government as to their plants' entitlement to FITs, or to the level of such FITs\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 288.\n\n***ii. Public statements by Italian officials***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nAs an alternative or additional source of its alleged legitimate expectations, Eskosol refers to certain public statements by Italian officials during 2010.\n\n430.\n\nSpecifically, Eskosol quotes statements about the forthcoming Conto Energia III that Undersecretary Saglia made at the Verona PV Summit in early May 2010, to what Eskosol characterizes as a \"targeted audience\" of investors.679 The statements in question were that (i) \"[i]t is the government\u2019s intention to enact... [a] new [Conto Energia] in order to give certainty to the entire sector,\" (ii) Conto Energia III would include \"the ability to take advantage of the tariffs for further 14 months after the target [of 3,000 MW] is achieved\"; and (iii) Italy\u2019s goal with the forthcoming decree was to \"simplify, but also give[] certainty of rules.\"680 Eskosol characterizes these statements as providing \"express and specific guarantees\" about an unalterable \"right to a 14-month minimum guarantee period for investors to secure the right to the incentivising tariff,\"681 giving rise to a legitimate expectation that Eskosol \"would have at the very least until May 2012 to build and connect\" its future PV plants and secure the Conto Energia III tariffs.682 These expectations were further reinforced, Eskosol says, by the National Action Plan\u2019s reference to the 14-month grace period expected to feature in Conto Energia III.683 Eskosol refers to Conto Energia III as then \"[f]ulfilling Italy\u2019s promises (at least temporarily).\"684\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 47.\n\nNational Press agencies Review of the 2010 Italian PV Summit, C-27.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 48.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 274.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 275.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 276.\n\n431.\n\nBy contrast, Italy refers to the Government statements prior to enactment of Conto Energia III as simply reciting (accurately) what the contents of Conto Energia III were expected to include. In its view, nothing in these statements constituted a \"guarantee that the *Conto Energia III* decree would remain unchanged until mid-2012.\"685\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 294.\n\n432.\n\nAs to this debate, the Tribunal begins by accepting, at the level of principle, that it is possible for State officials to generate legitimate expectations by clear commitments given to a defined category of recipients, and not just by those directed singly to one investor at a time. This was recognized by the *El Paso* tribunal, which distinguished between two types of specific commitments: \"those specific as to their addressee and those specific regarding their object and purpose.\"686 With respect to the latter, the tribunal reasoned as follows:\n\nSecond, a commitment can be considered specific if its *precise object was to give a real guarantee of stability to the investor*. Usually general texts cannot contain such commitments, as there is no guarantee that they will not be modified in due course. However, a reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of general statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific behaviour of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely.687\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6 375.\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6 377.\n\n433.\n\nAt the same time, however, the Tribunal believes it is important to distinguish in the analysis, as prior tribunals have done, between (i) statements made specifically to guarantee investors that they would not be subject to \"overly drastic changes,\" and (ii) those which are primarily \"[p]olitical statements\" or \"general legislative statements,\" which at best engender reduced expectations,688 since investors generally must assume that both politics and good faith legislation in the public interest might have to evolve to meet new challenges and unforeseen developments. While investors naturally may take into account the latter categories of statements in assessing the risks and benefits of potential investments, \"it is one thing to be induced by political proposals to make an economic decision, and another thing to be able to rely on these proposals to claim legal guarantees.\"689\n\n*El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379 (quoting *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 278 (\"*Continental Casualty*\").\n\n*El Paso,* CL-146, \u00b6 395.\n\n434.\n\nWith this distinction in mind, the Tribunal reverts to the particular statements made at the Verona Summit. These were largely *statements of intention* regarding the Government\u2019s plan for Conto Energia III, including the terms that it was expected to include. (The National Action Plan\u2019s reference to the expected terms of Conto Energia were of a similar nature.) An announcement of the particular terms that a future decree is expected to include cannot be taken as a specific commitment that once enacted, those terms never could be modified, even to react in rational, proportionate ways to unexpected challenges. For such a commitment to be found, there would need to be additional statements made about the *immutability* of the legal regime, and not just its expected contents.\n\n435.\n\nThat said, the Verona Summit statements did include, in addition to the description of the Conto Energia III\u2019s expected contents, several references to the State\u2019s objective of providing \"*certainty*\" to potential investors. An argument could be made that these references implied, if not expressly promised, that the Conto Energia III regime would be a source of predictability for investors, and accordingly would not be altered by the State (or at least not cavalierly, or based on circumstances that potentially could be foreseen). However, even if that proposition were to be accepted *arguendo*, there remains the key question of *which* investors were being promised the referenced \"certainty,\" and at what stage in their entrepreneurial development any such certainty about applicable rules could be expected to attach. The Tribunal is unable to accept these general statements as a specific commitment to the entire universe of potential PV plant investors, that no matter what steps they might or might not take to implement a specific PV plant project, they would enjoy an equal guarantee of \"certainty\" regarding the persistence of the planned Conto Energia III regime. Rather, the Tribunal sees these statements about certainty at best as addressed to a specific class of beneficiaries, namely those potential investors who would meet Conto Energia III\u2019s *own stated criteria* for entitlement to the benefits it described.\n\n436.\n\nIn other words, Undersecretary Saglia\u2019s statements about the Government\u2019s goal to provide certainty to the PV power sector through the issuance of Conto Energia III cannot be divorced from what the eventual decree itself actually said, about (i) which PV plant projects would have \"rights\" under its terms and (ii) at what point any such rights would attach. General predictions by Government officials about a legal regime they intend to introduce cannot be read separately from the more specific terms of what they actually introduced. Yet as the Tribunal explains further in the next section, Conto Energia III by its terms described \"rights\" of various sorts as attaching only to PV plants that *actually entered into operation* within certain specified timetables; the decree was crystal clear that until plants qualified for benefits by entering into operation, no such \"rights\" would attach. Given these express terms of Conto Energia III, the Tribunal is unable to find that the general public statements made to potential investors *prior* to Conto Energia III established any broader commitments to potential investors than the terms of Conto Energia III itself provided, when it entered into effect.\n\n***iii. The specific terms of Conto Energia III***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nEskosol\u2019s third source of alleged legitimate expectations arises from Conto Energia III itself. Eskosol contends that the fair and equitable treatment standard \"protects legitimate expectations arising from representations and guarantees provided by the host State... in its legislation and regulations.\"690 It posits that while \"it is generally understood that the FET standard of itself does not, in general, prevent the State from altering its law,\" this proposition is limited by an obligation not to \"significantly and unfairly alter the legal framework against which an investment was made.\"691 In its view, \"[l]egal and business stability and predictability protect[] investors against regulatory or policy changes that materially affect investors\u2019 rights arising from commitments of the State made through its laws.\"692 Eskosol then points to Conto Energia III as the law which allegedly constituted such a commitment, by providing a clear legal framework upon which Eskosol based its business plans and made its investments.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 252.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 293.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 292.\n\n438.\n\nBy contrast, Italy argues that \"an averagely diligent entrepreneur cannot presume that the legislation will not change,\" particularly in a heavily regulated market such as renewable energy.693 In its view, \"the safeguard against undesirable regulatory developments is the recourse to stabilisation clauses or insurance policies, not the hope that the law will retain their favourite bits (such as a policy granting access to certain advantages) until it is convenient for them.\"694 To the contrary, quoting *Electrabel,* Italy says \"it is well established that the host State is entitled to maintain a reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility to respond to changing circumstances in the public interest.\"695 In short, Italy says, \"the existence of a law cannot be mistaken for a promise that the law will not change.\"696\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 31.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 295.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322 (quoting *Electrabel*, RL-58, \u00b6 7.7.7).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 292.\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that there is a healthy debate in the jurisprudence regarding this particular question, namely whether there can be a legitimate expectation of legal stability based on the content of the laws in place, absent any extrinsic representations or assurances about the immutability of those laws. Some tribunals have stated that no legitimate expectation of stability can arise in these circumstances, while others have suggested that they can. The *Masdar* tribunal characterized these as \"two schools of thought\" on the question of legitimate expectations.697 Members of the Tribunal have taken positions on this question in other cases.698\n\n*Masdar*, RL-90, \u00b6\u00b6 490-491, 504, 511, 520-521 (ultimately deciding that regardless of \"to whichever of the two schools of thought individual members of the Tribunal might adhere\" with respect to legitimate expectations based on general laws, in that case there were also specific commitments made directly to the investor; \"[i]t would be difficult to conceive of a more specific commitment than a Resolution \u2026 addressed specifically to each of the Operating Companies \u2026. Because of these specific commitments, and irrespective of whether the general provisions [of law] would be sufficient (as the first school of thought would contend was the case), the Tribunal concludes that, in any event, Claimant had legitimate expectations that the benefits granted \u2026 would remain unaltered.\").\n\n*Compare, e.g., El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6\u00b6 352, 368, 372, 394 (\"[T]he Tribunal cannot follow the line of cases in which fair and equitable treatment was viewed as implying the stability of the legal and business framework\u2026. FET cannot be designed to ensure the immutability of the legal order \u2026 and play the role assumed by stabilisation clauses specifically granted to foreign investors with whom the State has signed investment agreements\u2026. Under a FET clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not be changed without justification of an economic, social or other nature,\" but not that the State commits \"never to change its legislation whatever the circumstances \u2026. The Tribunal however cannot consider that any rule or even clear commitment embodied in a general piece of legislation or regulation \u2026 is in itself a special commitment towards the foreign investors, as such a conclusion would again immobilize the legal order and prevent any adaptation to circumstances.\"), *with Charanne and Construction Investments v. Spain,* SCC Case No. V 062/2012, Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Dr. Tawil, 21 January 2016, RL-63, \u00b6 5 (\"in my opinion, the creation of legitimate expectations in an investor is not limited solely to the existence of a \u2018specific commitment' \u2026 but it can also derive from, or be based on, the legal system in force at the time of the investment.\").\n\n440.\n\nIn this case, however, there is no need for the Tribunal to render an abstract pronouncement on the contours of the legitimate expectations doctrine. That is because, by its terms, Conto Energia III did not purport to promise benefits with respect to any PV power plant *unless or until* that plant actually entered into operation. Article 8 of Conto Energia III, which sets forth the incentive tariffs at issue, begins with the threshold statement, \"[t]he incentivising tariffs referred to in this [article] shall apply to photovoltaic power plants *that enter into operation* ... after 31 December 2010.\"699 The following articles contain the same proviso, namely that \"plants... *that enter into operation*\" before the end of 2011 would have \"the right to\" the tariffs set forth in a table, and those *\"that enter into operation* in 2012 and 2013 [have] the right to\" such tariffs further reduced by 6% a year.700 While the language providing for a \"right\" may be legally significant, so too is the stated criteria for any such right attaching, namely entry into operation by a given date.\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 8(1) (emphasis added).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 8(2) (emphasis added).\n\n441.\n\nThe same is true with respect to the grace period, or sunset clause, upon which Eskosol sets great store. As may be recalled, Conto Energia III first referred to the \"national target\" of PV power of 8,000 MW, and then to the \"cumulative\" PV power \"that can receive the incentive rates provided for in... this decree,\" namely 3,000 MW.701 However, the decree also stated that \"[i]n case of depletion of the availability referred to [*i.e*., the 3,000 MW], the power plants, *which enter into operation* within fourteen months after the dates, to be communicated by the operator on its website, when the achievement of the [3,000 MW ceiling] are reached, have the right to the incentivising tariffs.\"702\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Arts. 3(1), 3(2).\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 3(6) (emphasis added).\n\n442.\n\nFinally, Conto Energia III had an overarching provision entitled \"Procedures to qualify for incentivising tariffs.\"703 The very first provision referred to an application to be filed \"[w]ithin ninety days after the date *when the plant [has] entered into service*.\"704\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 4.\n\nConto Energia III, CL-99, Art. 4(1) (emphasis added).\n\n443.\n\nGiven these provisions, the Tribunal agrees with Italy that \"incentives were linked to actual energy production.\"705 Italy takes the position that \"[l]egitimate expectations to *retain* those incentives\" did accrue to \"actual producers,\"706 with the implication that if it had tried to reduce or eliminate the tariffs *already flowing* to PV plant operators under Conto Energia III, or to shorten the time period over which such operators would enjoy the tariffs, then that indeed could have been an abrogation of legitimate expectations. But regardless of such a hypothetical, this is not what Italy ever did. To the contrary, the Romani Decree maintained for all such operators the 20-year flow of incentives at the tariff levels previously established for their plants.707\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 221.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 221 (emphasis in original). Italy distinguishes some of the Spanish incentive cases on this basis. *See, e.g., id.*, \u00b6 273 (distinguishing *Eiser* on the basis that \"the investor in that case... built and operated the plants\" and \"the investor's plants were formally registered to receive benefits under the applicable regime,\" whereas Eskosol \"never qualified \u2026 for the benefits under Conto Energia III\"), \u00b6 275 (arguing that past cases concerned \"the investor's expectations that their *acquired rights will be preserved* or not unfairly diminished or outright revoked,\" but did not stand for the proposition that \"*certain rights will be available for acquisition, and in a particular format, in the future*\") (emphasis in original), \u00b6 276 (contending that \"in all the cases cited, the \u2026 investors \u2026 already were subject to the State measures,\" which \"is certainly not the case for Claimant\"), and \u00b6\u00b6 283-286 (arguing that even the dissent in *Charanne* and *Isolux* \"anchored the notion of legitimate expectations on that of acquired rights,\" meaning compliance with the legal requirements to obtain particular benefits, whereas Eskosol \"never acquired the right to the benefits, because it never complied with the legal requirements set by the law\"); *see similarly* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 255-256 (distinguishing *Masdar* as finding a breach of legitimate expectations related to benefits that the investor already had acquired by complying with the necessary requirements).\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 291 (noting that \"[t]he benefits of \u2026 Conto Energia III \u2026 still apply today to all qualifying plants\").\n\n444.\n\nThe Romani Decree also provided a roughly three month grace period, under which new plants that came into operation by 31 May 2011 would be entitled to 20 years of the Conto Energia III tariff levels.708 Italy refers to this *second category* of plant owners, when it states that in addition to existing operators having a legitimate expectation \"*to retain\"* prior incentive levels, \"[l]egitimate expectations to *obtain* [the Conto Energia III] incentives\" could arise for others \"when production was imminent.\" Again, however, Italy emphasizes that \"Italy has never failed to respect these expectations,\"709 by providing a reasonable grace period for plants close to completion to conclude their finishing steps.\n\nRomani Decree, C-75, Art. 25(9).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 221 (emphasis in original).\n\n445.\n\nOn the facts of this case, the Tribunal does not need to decide the legitimate expectations question for a potential *third category* of plant owners, namely those who succeeded in bringing new PV plants into operation only *after* 31 May 2011, but still within the dates that Conto Energia III originally had specified for its application. For such plants, a debate between the two \"schools of thought\" on legitimate expectations hypothetically could arise, about whether Conto Energia III gave such plant owners a legitimate expectation to be able to receive the listed tariff *upon their fulfillment of its originally stated requirements*, notwithstanding the decree\u2019s early termination. The issue in such a case would be whether the benefits that Conto Energia III described as \"rights\" to be provided to a plant entering into operation by a specified date could survive the State\u2019s decision to change the applicable rules, *if* the plant nonetheless proceeded to operation within those dates. Otherwise framed, the legal question in this hypothetical case would be whether the ECT requires a State, after declaring that it will provide certain \"rights\" to certain intended beneficiaries upon their fulfillment of certain conditions, to uphold that promise or compensate the *qualifying* beneficiaries for not doing so, even if the State acted in good faith and not arbitrarily in altering its regulatory regime.\n\n446.\n\nHere, however, that particular scenario is not presented either. Unlike the hypothetical investor in the scenario above, Eskosol did not construct a single one of the 120 PV plants it originally had hoped to build, and therefore no such plant entered into operation - either within Conto Energia III\u2019s original projected maximum timeframe (2011-2013), or within the grace period Conto Energia III had provided in case the ceiling of 3,000 MW of additional PV capacity was hit early *(i.e.,* 14 months from when the 3,000 MW were achieved). In other words, the *stated preconditions* for any \"rights\" that might have attached to such plants, under Conto Energia III\u2019s own terms, did not materialize. This is therefore not a situation where an investor already has \"complie[d] with all the established requirements of the current legislation in order to be entitled to an expected and determinable benefit,\"710 only to have the State renege on promises for which the investor already demonstrably had qualified. Eskosol never complied with the stated preconditions in Conto Energia III for any rights to attach under its terms.\n\n*Charanne*, Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Dr. Tawil, RL-63, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 12 (referring to a regime in Spain that required PV plant investments to \"be made, entered into the registry, and put into operation prior to the expiration of a deadline,\" and opining also that \"[o]nce [an investor] made the investment, *complying with all the existing requirements of the rules governing the granting of the expected benefit* \u2026, it does not appear to \u2026 legally acceptable [for] the receiving State to modify or eliminate them without some legal consequence\") (emphasis added).\n\n447.\n\nThe Parties differ on the reasons Eskosol did not build any PV plants in Italy, much less bring them into operation. Eskosol\u2019s explanation is that the financing it had hoped to arrange, to permit it to proceed with construction under the EPC Contract, became more elusive after the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV. It may be recalled that Eskosol signed the EPC Contract in order to demonstrate its *bona fides* to potential funders, but at the same time depended on obtaining outside financing to meet even its first payment obligation to Siemens under that Contract. Eskosol claims that the regulatory changes in Italy interfered with its efforts to lock down financing on terms it previously had explored with potential funders, and that by the time it might have explored alternate financing deals - either for a project of the original scope or for a smaller scale project involving fewer PV plants - there was no longer time to complete plant construction, within the one-year grace period for construction that the Romani Decree provided for plants occupying more than 10% of agricultural land plots.711 Italy counters that Eskosol\u2019s inability to complete any plants was a consequence of the unique vulnerability of its project and its own risky business decisions, including (i) a complex design involving using many small plants to take advantage of simplified permitting procedures but treating them as a single, unprecedently large project for purposes of exploring financing, and (ii) deciding for tactical reasons to delay starting construction on any of the plants until completing the electrical connections for all 120, instead of building plants gradually in batches, in parallel with their required connections.712\n\n*See, e.g.,* Magli II, \u00b6\u00b6 35-46.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 222; Resp. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 53; *see also Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 376 (explaining that \"the legality of the Project \u2026 depended on \u2026 small plants of less than 1MW,\" but \"its economic viability depended on the cumulation of those plants into a large aggregated array,\" but this required \"substantial financing\" which \"[t]he Project never obtained\").\n\n448.\n\nThis factual debate is interesting, but ultimately there is no need for the Tribunal to opine on the commercial wisdom of Eskosol\u2019s business plan, nor on whether some alternate plan might have enabled it to adapt more readily to the 2011 regulatory changes. The bottom line remains that nothing in Conto Energia III purported to extend any rights to would-be developers or operators of future plants, *prior* to their actual completion and commissioning. There was no provision extending rights to entrepreneurs who hoped to build PV plants within a particular time period; or to operators who were in the process of arranging financing based on such plans; or to those who held DIA permits, authorizing construction to begin whenever financing was ready; or to those who built electrical substations with the intention one day of connecting these to future PV plants. The decree by its terms spoke only of the benefits to be afforded plants that actually entered into operation, and made crystal clear that such entry into operation was the critical qualifying event for any rights to attach.\n\n449.\n\nIn other words, even if (*arguendo*) Conto Energia III could be seen as creating legitimate expectations for a defined class of beneficiaries to receive a defined type of treatment, *Eskosol simply did not fall within that defined class of beneficiaries*. Under any framing of the legitimate expectations doctrine, Eskosol therefore cannot claim an entitlement to protection against a change in the Conto Energia III legal regime, under whose own terms it never qualified in the first place.\n\n***iv. Agricultural land use regulations***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal sees nothing in the record that arguably could constitute a commitment, representation or assurance to Eskosol - or to a defined class of investors to which it belonged - that the agricultural land use regulations in effect prior to March 2011 would not be changed, or that the effective date of any such change would be more than a year (which was the grace period that the Romani Decree itself provided).\n\n451.\n\nEskosol does not allege that Italy ever made any promises to anyone to maintain, indefinitely or for any specific period of time, the availability of preferential incentive tariffs for PV plants built on up to 50% of their land parcels. Rather, its argument with respect to this issue boils down to the assertion that (i) the prior regime so provided, (ii) Eskosol presumed, without any State assurances, that the prior land use regime would remain in effect, (iii) it designed its project plans based on this presumption, but (iv) Italy then changed the regime, while admittedly providing a one-year grace period, and (v) that grace period proved insufficient for Eskosol to complete either a project of the original planned scope or any other, smaller project. All of this may well have been true, but this was a risk that Eskosol assumed. No conduct of Italy has been alleged to induce Eskosol to rely on a purported immutability of the prior land use regime. Further, nothing in the prior land use regulations even purported to address the length of time in which such regulations would remain in effect.\n\n452.\n\nIn other words, this is not a situation where Eskosol was *affirmatively led by Italy* to expect that its prior land use regime would remain in place for a particular period of time, or would be phased out only with a grace period of a particular length. There is no evidence of a representation or assurance in either regard. Yet it is axiomatic that legitimate expectations must be based on some form of State conduct, and not simply on the investor\u2019s own subjective expectations. Absent any evidence of such conduct, the Tribunal is unable to accept that Eskosol had an objectively legitimate expectation regarding the longevity of the prior agricultural land regime, and therefore that by changing its regime with a grace period of one year, Italy contravened any such legitimate expectation in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\nC. **Umbrella clause**\n----------------------\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its description of Eskosol\u2019s umbrella clause claim with the general observation that Eskosol devoted relatively limited briefing to it, as was the case for all of its ECT claims other than the fair and equitable treatment claim (to which it devoted substantial attention). Italy accordingly also devoted limited space in its memorials to these non-FET claims. The Tribunal summarizes below the limited arguments that the Parties presented.\n\n**1. Eskosol\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n454.\n\nEskosol relies on the following provision in Article 10(1) of the ECT as a provision generally referred to as an \"umbrella clause\":\n\nEach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has entered into with an investor of another contracting party.713\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 335.\n\n455.\n\nEskosol contends that by virtue of the phrase *\"any* obligations\" (emphasis added), this provision must be read as extending treaty protection to commitments by host States undertaken in a variety of formats, including through their unilateral acts and through their domestic legislation and regulations.714 Eskosol rejects Italy's suggestion that the ECT's umbrella clause is limited to specific commitments made to a particular investor *(i.e.,* by Italy to Eskosol). In its view, Article 10(1) of the ECT does not contain such a requirement, and there is general agreement in the jurisprudence (Eskosol says) that legislation alone can amount to an undertaking under the umbrella clause.715 In any event, Eskosol contends, the series of iterations of Conto Energia did contain a specific commitment.716\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 336 (citing *Khan Resources Inc., Khan Resources B.V., and Cauc Holding Company Ltd. v.

Italy\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------\n\n458.\n\nItaly denies any breach of the umbrella clause contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n459.\n\nFirst, Italy contends that there was no breach of Italian law susceptible of being elevated to a Treaty violation.\n\n460.\n\nSecond, Italy argues that the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) requires a commitment to have been made with respect to a specific investment or investor. \"General regulatory measures with open-ended application cannot be considered to produce commitments for specific investors enforceable through an umbrella clause.\"721\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 375; *see also* *Noble Ventures, Inc v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award, 12 October 2005, RL-71 (\"*Noble Ventures*\"), \u00b6 51; *Isolux,* RL-60, \u00b6 772.\n\n461.\n\nThird, Italy argues that even if specific investors who had qualified under Conto Energia III could claim to have derived enforceable rights from it, Eskosol never did.722 Eskosol never built any PV plant, let alone an operating plant that could acquire a right to the incentivizing tariffs.723 In Italy's view, the Claimant challenged certain regulatory acts that never applied to it. It is therefore impossible that the slight modifications of the Italian incentive scheme could harm the investor, as they concerned legal entitlements that it had never acquired and that, in fact, [it] was never close to acquiring.724\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 10.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n462.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept, as a general proposition, that laws of general applicability qualify under Article 10(1) of the ECT as \"obligation[s]... *entered into with* an investor of another contracting party\" (emphasis added). The very notion of \"enter[ing] into\" an obligation \"with an investor\" implies, as a matter of ordinary meaning, that there has been some *interaction* between the State and the investor, from which a particular obligation results. In most cases, that interaction presumably would be *direct*, such as through a contract or an investment authorization. Nonetheless, the Tribunal does not rule out, at least at the level of theory, that in rare cases a State might be shown to have entered into obligations *indirectly* with a given investor, for example by making a binding commitment to a narrow and targeted class of investors in which that investor is known to fall. Even so, such obligations would be expected to be documented in some form other than through laws of general applicability.725\n\n*See* *Foresight Luxembourg Solar 1 S.\u00c0.R.L., Foresight Luxembourg Solar 2 S.\u00c0.R.L., Greentech Energy Systems A/S, GWM Renewable Energy I S.PA., GWM Renewable Energy II S.PA. v. The Kingdom of Spain,* SCC Arbitration 2015/150, Final Award, 14 November 2018, CL-195 (\"*Greentech*\"), \u00b6 413 (considering that the obligation at issue in Article 10(1) \"applies to a specific commitment rather than a general regulatory act\"); *Noble Ventures*, RL-71, \u00b6 51 (\"The employment of the notion \u2018entered into' indicates that specific commitments are referred to and not general commitments, for example by way of legislative acts\"); *Isolux*, RL-60, \u00b6 772 (citing *Noble Ventures*); *cf.* *Continental Casualty*, \u00b6\u00b6 300-302, CL-138 (stating that \"it should be clear that th[e] umbrella clause does not come into play when the breach complained of concerns general obligations arising from the law of the host State,\" and finding an umbrella clause violation *not* because of changes in Argentina's laws, which \"cannot be a source of obligations that Argentina has assumed specifically with regard to the Claimant's investment company and which are protected under the BIT's umbrella clause,\" but rather because of *additional specific assurances* in an Offering Memorandum that was distributed to investors to induce them to make the investments at issue).\n\n463.\n\nIn this case, there is no need to drill down further into the doctrinal debate, because as demonstrated above, Eskosol never brought itself within the group to whom (even by its own theory) a State commitment was made. Eskosol claims that Conto Energia III \"embodied Italy's undertakings vis-\u00e0-vis Claimant\"726 because it supposedly \"guaranteed\" certain preferential tariffs to any investor \"so long as they connected their PV plants to the electric grid by a specified time frame.\"727 But Eskosol never connected any PV plants to the grid within any timetable, so even by Eskosol's own theory, it did not qualify for the class to whom any alleged undertakings were provided. This is sufficient, on the facts, to dispose of the umbrella clause claim under ECT Article 10(1).\n\nReply, \u00b6 159.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 341.\n\n**D. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**1. Eskosol\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n464.\n\nAs with its umbrella clause claim, Eskosol addresses only very briefly in its submissions the allegations of expropriation in violation of Article 13(1) of the ECT. It begins with the uncontroversial observation that the provision \"protects investments against indirect measures of expropriation,\"728 citing various cases for the proposition that treaty reference to \"measures having effect equivalent\" or \"tantamount to\" nationalization or expropriation address indirect rather than direct takings.729 To determine whether such a taking has occurred, Eskosol proposes the *Metalclad* formulation about acts which have \"the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit of property.\"730 It then proposes a \"sole effects test,\" described by the tribunal in *Burlington* as examining whether \"the investment as a whole has become unviable,\" in the sense that it \"cannot generate a commercial return.\"731\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 347.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 347-348 (citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Italy\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------\n\n466.\n\nItaly rejects Eskosol\u2019s claim that the measures amounted to unlawful expropriation.\n\n467.\n\nItaly first argues that Eskosol does not establish a causal link between the Government\u2019s actions and any deprivation, and that such a link does not in fact exist. Italy refers to the arguments about causation it presented in its defense to the FET claim, and states that these are equally relevant for the expropriation analysis.736 Italy also criticizes Eskosol\u2019s expropriation arguments as \"circular,\" since Eskosol argued that Italy\u2019s conduct was *unlawful* because of the harm Eskosol allegedly suffered, but at the same time it argues that the harm was *suffered* because the conduct was unlawful.737 Italy says there is no \"hard proof of a causal link in either direction,\" but at most a \"temporal correlation.\"738\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 354-355.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 356.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 357.\n\n468.\n\nItaly also contends that Eskosol has not proven \"complete impairment\" of the investment as required to prove direct or indirect expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT, and that \"[t]he policing of indirect expropriation... cannot stretch as far [as] covering all harmful effects that a State measure might cause to the investment,\" short of total deprivation.739 Here, Eskosol\u2019s property interest in the SPVs remained unaffected, and the SPVs\u2019 interest in the lands and DIAs they acquired \"did not change at any time.\"740 The \"Eskosol Project\" as such was simply \"a business plan,\" which Eskosol continued to try to market to potential funders \"long after Conto Energia IV was passed.\"741 While funders may have been skeptical of the project\u2019s viability, \"the profitability of an asset is not a substitute for its property, use and enjoyment,\" and \"[a] decrease of the former cannot be equated to a deprivation of the latter.\"742 At most, Eskosol is claiming that \"its future profits were expropriated,\" but (as Italy says the tribunal in *Blusun* found), the reason \"the benefits... never came to fruition\" was \"because Claimant never met the requirements to receive them (banally, it never built the energy plants).\"743 Italy emphasizes that \"[t]here is no automaticity in obtaining incentives,\" and while an investor \"might expect to receive incentives once it is operational and it has respected all required conditions under legislation, it has no entitlement until that very moment\" - and in this case, \"Eskosol never even got close to that moment.\"744 In Italy\u2019s view, \"[i]t is therefore impossible to talk about expropriation or even deprivation of something that never existed.\"745\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 359.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 361.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 362.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 362.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 363 (citing *Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 402).\n\nResp. PHB, \u00b6 23(B).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 363.\n\n469.\n\nFinally, Italy argues that \"no indirect expropriation can arise from the State\u2019s exercise of its police powers.\"746 Italy quotes *Blusun* for the proposition that \"the situation was not analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the Project by Italy,\" because it simply involved the State\u2019s non-discriminatory public-interest changes to a regulatory regime, which when \"combined with operational decisions made by the investors and the lack of prearranged Project financing, meant that the Project remained radically incomplete, never qualified for feed-in tariffs, and inevitably went into liquidation.\"747 Italy cites *Methanex* and other cases for the proposition that \"a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process,\" does not amount to expropriation simply because it affects a foreign investor or investment.748 Here, the measures were clearly in the public interest, Italy says, because, they were \"designed, according to a goal of effectiveness and reasonable balance of costs, to promote renewable energy production in a sustainable way,\" and accordingly it would be \"clearly excessive\" to allow Eskosol to sue \"in order to make up for an estimate[d] drop in profits.\"749 Italy quotes *Feldman* for the proposition that States \"must be free to act in the broader public interest through [*inter alia*] the granting or withdrawal of Government subsidies, reductions or increases in tariff levels... and the like.\"750\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 364.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 365 (citing *Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 401).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 366 (citing *Methanex Corporation v.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with a reminder of general principles, namely that the doctrine of expropriation involves deprivation of protected rights in property. As the tribunal in *Emmis* observed, the origin of the term expropriation is the Latin word *expropriat,* from the verb *expropriare*, which contains the root *proprium* (property) as well as the prefix *ex* (out or from). In consequence, a finding of expropriation must be premised on a showing that \"Claimants must have held a property right of which they have been deprived.\"751 The property right or asset in question \"must have vested (directly or indirectly) in the claimant for him to seek redress.\"752\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., et al. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014, \u00b6 159, available at http://icsidfiles.worldbank.org/icsid/ICSIDBLOBS/OnlineAwards/C2000/DC4468En.pdf ; *see also id.*, \u00b6 161 (explaining that \"[t]he need to identify a proprietary interest that has been taken is confirmed by the definition of \u2018investment' in the Treaties,\" which refer to \"assets,\" a term whose ordinary meaning itself involves an item of property or property rights), \u00b6 162 (finding that the existence of property rights must be determined with reference to host State law, since \"[p]ublic international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law\").\n\n*Emmis*, \u00b6 168 (citing numerous cases requiring identification of the rights duly held by a claimant as precondition to determining if those rights were taken).\n\n471.\n\nEskosol seems to acknowledge the required nexus between an established property right and an expropriation claim, by contending that \"its property rights were detrimentally affected which amounted to an unlawful expropriation.\"753 The difficulty however is identifying what specific property rights of Eskosol\u2019s allegedly were taken. There is no dispute that Eskosol retains ownership of the SPVs, which still own all of the land, assets, and contract rights that belong to them. Eskosol also retains the ability, should it wish, to build PV power plants on the land owned by its SPVs and connect them to the electrical grid. What Eskosol claims it lost, as a result of the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, was the prospect of doing so within a framework that would allow it to sell its power at certain prices, though the application of a special tariff regime subsidized by consumers which would support pricing above market levels, and thereby guarantee returns on its investment. In other words, Eskosol complains that prior to the challenged Government acts, it had the potential to use its assets in a way that would enhance their value to a particular extent - assuming it first could obtain financing to build the envisioned PV plants within a projected timeframe - but that the challenged Government acts shortened that timeframe and lowered tariffs thereafter, to such an extent that the business plan no longer would work.\n\nCl. PHB, \u00b6 198.\n\n472.\n\nThe difficulty for an expropriation analysis is that Eskosol cannot show that it had a recognized *property right* to obtain this enhanced value of its assets, through participation in the Conto Energia III tariff regime. As discussed above, Conto Energia III was clear that only such PV plants who qualified for its benefits, by entering into operation within specified dates, would be granted stated rights. This case does not concern any plants that so qualified, and which therefore might try to invoke doctrines of vested rights to complain about deprivation of any such rights with an effect on their investment that was tantamount to expropriation.754 At best, Eskosol might argue that it was *well positioned to eventually secure a legal right,* but nothing in the Italian legislation transformed positioning to secure a future legal right into a legal right as such.755 And absent any *established right* that was abrogated by Government interference, the fact that Government conduct may have impacted a company business plan does not itself amount to expropriation, even if the end result ultimately is that the company was unable to survive financially.\n\n*See similarly Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 402 (noting that \"[t]he difficulty with [Blusun's expropriation claim] lies in its assumption that the Claimants were entitled to \u2026 the full benefit of current FITs \u2013 without complying with the conditions consistently imposed on applicants for FITs, i.e. timely completion of the solar panels and their connection to the grid\"). *Cf.* *Emmis*, \u00b6 255 (dismissing expropriation claim after finding no interference with the proprietary rights the claimants indisputably had, and no additional property right to a future benefit for which the claimants had not qualified).\n\n*See similarly Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 407 (noting that \"[t]he Claimants never lost title to the land \u2026 [and] had no right \u2026 to the enhanced value of the land on the footing that the Project would succeed\").\n\n473.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the same conclusion as did the *Blusun* tribunal, namely that \"the situation was not analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the Project by Italy.\"756 The expropriation claim therefore is denied.\n\n*Blusun*, RL-56, \u00b6 401.\n\n**E. Constant Protection and Security**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. Eskosol\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n474.\n\nEskosol states that, by providing that \"investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security,\" Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes upon States an obligation of vigilance and due diligence.757 Citing a number of international investment law authorities, Eskosol argues that \"the scope of legal protection to be afforded to an investment under the full protection and security clause extends to providing legal stability, and certainty in legal norms.\"758 Contrary to Italy\u2019s position, Eskosol contends that the \"legal stability\" view of full protection and security is not defeated by contentions that the FET obligation also protects legal stability, since FET and full protection and security are two distinct ECT protections that must be assessed separately.759\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 354-355; *see also* ECT, C-1, Art. 10(1) (emphasis added); *American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, Award, 21 February 1997, CL-139, \u00b6\u00b6 6.05-6.11.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 355-358 (citing *CME*, CL-142, \u00b6 613; *National Grid plc v.

Eskosol also challenges Italy's reliance on *Isolux*, RL-60, contending that the claimant in that case did not properly plead a full protection and security violation.\n\n475.\n\nUnder this standard, Eskosol contends that Italy \"was required actively to protect Eskosol\u2019s investments,\" which \"involved, in particular, and at the very least, the application of the legal and regulatory framework that it had established specifically to ensure the viability and legal and economic protection and security of investments such as Eskosol\u2019s.\"760 According to Eskosol, Italy failed to protect Eskosol by passing the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV.761\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 359.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 361.\n\n**2. Italy\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------\n\n476.\n\nItaly rejects Eskosol\u2019s claim that it breached its full protection and security obligation.762 It contends that Eskosol\u2019s interpretation of the standard follows a minoritarian view,763 and that the obligation includes only protection of an investment\u2019s physical integrity. Under Eskosol\u2019s broader construction of the standard, Italy argues, the contours of full protection and security would overlap with those of the FET standard.764\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 370-372.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 370.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 371 (criticizing Eskosol's reliance on *National Grid* and other Argentina cases).\n\n477.\n\nBased on Italy\u2019s narrower view of the applicable standard, it rejects Eskosol\u2019s full protection and security claim \"because no act attributable to Italy threatened the integrity of the investors, the investment, and their assets.\"765\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 372 (citing *Isolux,* RL-60, \u00b6 817).\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n478.\n\nGiven the relatively limited attention the Parties paid to this claim,766 this is not the occasion for the Tribunal to enter into a lengthy and detailed explication of its members\u2019 respective nuanced views on the standard. It suffices to say that whatever framing the ECT\u2019s \"constant security and protection\" standard is given, the Tribunal does not believe Italy violated it on the facts of this case.\n\n*See generally* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 359-366 (discussing both the legal standard and the alleged breach in a total of three pages); Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 370-372 (same in just three paragraphs); Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 363-366 (same in just four paragraphs); Rejoinder, \u00b6 317 (two sentences cross-referencing prior submission); Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 192-196 (one page); Resp. PHB, \u00b6 9 (one sentence).\n\n479.\n\nFirst, that conclusion is self-evident if the standard is considered to be limited to its original customary international law dimensions, of a due diligence obligation to protect the physical security of Eskosol\u2019s investment from harm by third parties. There is no allegation that any of Eskosol\u2019s property, assets or personnel were ever threatened by anyone.\n\n480.\n\nSecond, if the standard were considered to be somewhat wider, to encompass *\"legal security\"* in the limited sense of a State\u2019s obligation to provide investors with *access* to reasonable avenues of judicial redress,767 there equally is no violation, because Eskosol has not alleged any insufficiency in this regard.\n\n*See, e.g., Electrabel*, RL-58, \u00b6 7,146 (finding that the ECT's constant protection and security obligation included the duty to put at the claimant's disposal \"the \u2026 tools for obtaining redress\"); *Parkerings*, RL-59, \u00b6 360 (finding a treaty duty to for a State to \"keep it judicial system available for the Claimant to bring its contractual claims\" and for such claims to \"be properlty examined in accordance with domestic and international law by a impartial and fair court\"); see *also A.M.F. Aircraftleasing Meier & Fischer GmbH & Co. KG v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2017-15, Final Award, 11 May 2020, (\"*AMF*\") \u00b6\u00b6 649-632, *available at* https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw11589.pdf (discussing cases addressing legal redress as part of the full protection and security).\n\n481.\n\nFinally, even if (*arguendo*) the constant protection and security standard were to be given a broader interpretation as entailing some element of *\"legal stability\"* (which the Tribunal does not accept), the fact remains that even under this construction, the standard still would be one of \"due diligence,\" embodying notions of reasonable care, and not a \"strict liability\" standard or an obligation of result. This conclusion is in line with the International Court of Justice\u2019s warning that the provision of constant protection and security \"cannot be construed as the *giving of a warranty* that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed,\"768 and numerous tribunals have agreed on this point.769 Accordingly, even tribunals that might see constant protection and security as including some component of \"legal stability\" should accept that the obligation would not require some absolute freezing of regulatory frameworks in place, but simply that due diligence (or reasonable care) be taken to protect against *unnecessary or disproportionate* upheaval and associated harm to investments, taking into account also the rationale and urgency of a particular regulatory change. In this case, as discussed *supra*, Italy did take reasonable care to provide protection to those PV sector investors who already were fairly far along in their PV plant development plans, both by providing grace periods for them still to qualify under prior regulatory regimes *(e.g.,* three months for the Conto Energia III tariffs, one year for the agricultural land rules that would enable investors to take advantage of Conto Energia IV) and by allowing plant developers to begin the qualification process for Conto Energia IV at an earlier stage of development (by registering during construction rather than applying only after commissioning and entry into operation).\n\n*ELSI*, CL-120, \u00b6 108 (emphasis added).\n\n*See, e.g., El Paso*, CL-146, \u00b6\u00b6 522-523 (considering that full protection and security standard to be \"no more than the traditional obligation to protect aliens under international law and \u2026 it is a residual obligation provided for in those cases in which the acts challenged may not in themselves be attributed to the Government, bot to a third party,\" but noting in any event that the *concept of due diligence* \"does not mean that the State has to prevent each and every injury,\" but only to \"take reasonable actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be, aware that there is a risk of injury. *The precise degree of care, of what is \u2018reasonable' or \u2018due,' depends in part on the circumstances*.\") (emphasis added); *Electrabel*, RL-58, \u00b6 7.83 (\"concur[ring] with the description\" of the standard in *El Paso*); *AMF*, *supra,* \u00b6 654.\n\n482.\n\nIn these circumstances, the same conclusion would be warranted under *any* doctrinal approach to constant protection and security that still recognizes the central notion of \"due diligence\" embodied in the standard. That is because a due diligence obligation cannot be stretched to require a State to provide transitional mechanisms that would cover *all possible investors*, at any stage of their development plans whatsoever, from any possible impact of regulatory change, in circumstances (as here) where that change took the form of general sector-wide enactment that were not discriminatory, were taken in good faith, and were reasonably related to a rational public policy goal.\n\n483.\n\nFor these reasons, Eskosol\u2019s \"constant protection and security\" claim under Article 10(1) is denied.\n\n**F. Impairment by Unreasonable or Discriminatory Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Eskosol\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------\n\n484.\n\nFinally, Eskosol notes that Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that \"no contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures [the investments\u2019] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.\"770 It contends that this is a flexible and broad standard, which should be interpreted in light of all the circumstances of the case.771 Relying on the *National Grid* award, Eskosol also contends that the term \"unreasonable\" should have the same meaning as \"arbitrary.\"772\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 363; ECT, C-1, Art. 10(1).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 364 (citing *CME*, CL-142, \u00b6 158).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 365 (citing *National Grid*, CL-130, \u00b6 197).\n\n485.\n\nEskosol states that the analysis it presented regarding the FET and full protection and security standards applies equally to this standard. It argues that Italy breached its obligation of reasonableness by considerably altering the rights created by the legal framework in which Eskosol invested, and by doing so \"capriciously, and without any justifiable reason.\"773\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 366.\n\n**2. Italy\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------\n\n486.\n\nItaly argues that Eskosol has failed to explain why this claim should warrant separate treatment from the FET claim, given that Eskosol simply \"rehashes the reasoning on reasonableness that it employed to advance the FET and FPS allegations.\" Italy refers the Tribunal to its arguments regarding those allegations.774\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal again notes the brevity of the Parties\u2019 briefing on this standard,775 as well as their mutual cross-reference for its content to other ECT standards that the Tribunal already has addressed. In particular, Eskosol does not allege discrimination, so this claim boils down to an allegation of impairment of its investment \"by unreasonable... measures,\" and Eskosol contends that the term \"unreasonable\" should have the same meaning as \"arbitrary\" - which the Tribunal extensively addressed in connection with the FET claim. Italy agrees that the claim should be addressed under the same rubric of reasonableness considered for the FET claim.\n\n*See* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 363-367 (presenting the claim in four paragraphs); Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379 (opposing the claim in two paragraphs, which simply cross reference arguments in other sections). Neither Party provided any additional briefing in its respective Reply or Rejoinder or Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n488.\n\nIn these circumstances, there is nothing further for the Tribunal to decide, beyond noting the relevance of the issues it already has decided.776 Specifically, the Tribunal has found that the challenged measures did not violate the ECT on account of alleged arbitrariness. The equivalently framed claim for unreasonableness fails on the same basis.\n\n*See generally Greentech*, CL-195, \u00b6\u00b6 400, 403 (agreeing with the *Novoenergia* tribunal that \"[u]nder the rationale of procedural economy it is generally accepted that an arbitral tribunal does not need to address claims and issues that are already implied in those that are essential to its decision,\" but that where applicable procedural rules require a tribunal ruling on each separate request for relief, tribunals should do so while keeping their reasons brief).\n\n**G. Conclusion on Liability**\n------------------------------\n\n489.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal denies Eskosol\u2019s various liability claims, including specifically its claims for breach of the obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT with respect to (i) the fair and equitable treatment standard, (ii) the umbrella clause, (iii) expropriation, (iv) constant protection and security, and (v) to unreasonable or discriminatory measures.777 Because Eskosol has not succeeded on any of its liability claims, there is no need for the Tribunal to summarize or resolve the Parties\u2019 respective positions with respect to any damages. The Tribunal therefore proceeds below to the only remaining issue, which is the assessment and allocation of costs in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 247.\n\n**VIII. costs**\n---------------\n\n**A. Eskosol\u2019s Cost Submission**\n--------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Eskosol reiterates its request that the Tribunal issue an award granting it the relief it has requested in these proceedings, including compensation for the costs Eskosol has incurred in this matter. Eskosol submits the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):778\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Legal fees:** | **\u20ac4,729,083** |\n| Winston & Strawn LLP | \u20ac4,462,083 |\n| AVV Giuseppe Spagnolo | \u20ac 267,000 |\n| **Expert fees:** | **\u20ac 660,911** |\n| Fichtner Management Consulting AG | \u20ac 657,271 |\n| Terrin Association | \u20ac 3,640 |\n| **Translation fees:** | **\u20ac 58,665** |\n| **Other costs:** | **\u20ac 187,170** |\n| **ICSID Lodging fee:** | **\u20ac 23,305** |\n| **TOTAL: \u20ac5,659,134** |\n\nLetter from the Claimant to the Tribunal dated 11 January 2019.\n\n**B. Italy\u2019s Cost Submission**\n------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nItaly claims that Eskosol should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings. It submits the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):779\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Attendances:** | **\u20ac 400,000 ($ 459,132)** |\n| **Legal Fees:** | **\u20ac 500,000 ($ 573,914)** |\n| **Costs:** | **\u20ac 70,000 ($ 80,348)** |\n| **Attendance at Hearing:** | **\u20ac 20,000 ($ 22,957)** |\n| **TOTAL:** | **\u20ac 990,000 ($1,136,351)** |\n\nLetter from the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 18 January 2019.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n493.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n494.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in many ICSID cases, each party bears its own costs, while in other cases costs follow the event. In this case, however, even the latter principle would require some nuanced application. While Italy ultimately prevailed on the merits, Eskosol prevailed in relation to significant non-merits issues, including Italy\u2019s objection under Rule 41(5), its application for immediate termination, its application for suspension, and its various jurisdictional objections. Those applications and objections contributed to the overall costs of these proceedings, and indeed occasioned two prior lengthy decisions by the Tribunal, the Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection and the Decision on Termination. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would not be appropriate to ignore those facts in considering the ultimate allocation of costs. Ultimately, considering that both Parties prevailed to some significant extent, the Tribunal concludes that each Party should bear 50% of the costs of the arbitration, and should continue to bear its own direct costs incurred in connection with the proceeding.\n\n495.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount (in USD) to $ 765,634.54.780\n\nA breakdown of these figures will be provided to the Parties by the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n496.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione:** | **$ 524,928** |\n| **Italian Republic:** | **$ 407,740.02** |\n\n497.\n\nAs a result of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling that each Party shall bear 50% of the costs of the arbitration, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to $ 382,817.27.781\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n498.\n\nAccordingly, as the Parties each have already borne 50% of the costs of the arbitration, no order of recovery of costs is due to either Party from the other.\n\n**IX. AWARD**\n-------------\n\n499.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Respondent\u2019s request for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and/or inadmissibility is denied.\n\n(2) The Claimant\u2019s request for a declaration that Italy has breached its obligations under the ECT and/or international law is denied.\n\n(3) Specifically, the Claimant\u2019s request for a declaration that Italy\u2019s actions and omissions are unfair and inequitable; unreasonable; have failed to protect Eskosol\u2019s Investments; have failed to observe its obligations under the \"umbrella clause\" in the ECT; or have effectively expropriated Eskosol's Investments without prompt, adequate and effective compensation, are each denied.\n\n(4) Both Parties' requests for an award of costs are denied."}]}
