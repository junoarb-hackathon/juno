PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Procedural Order No. 2 addresses the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation dated 19 July 2023 (the \"**Request for Bifurcation**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 19 July 2023, the Respondent filed the Request for Bifurcation in accordance with Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n3.\n\nOn 30 August 2023, the Claimants filed their Reply to the Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Reply**\") in accordance with Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n4.\n\nAfter summarizing the Parties' positions in Section II of this Procedural Order, the Tribunal provides the reasons for its decision in Section III. The Tribunal's decision is set out in Section IV.\n\n**II. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n*A. Respondent's Position*\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn the Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to bifurcate the proceeding, suspend the proceeding on the merits and decide the Respondent's jurisdictional objections as a preliminary matter.1\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 95.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal is entitled to decide jurisdictional objections as a preliminary question and relies on Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 45(4) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. The Respondent argues that these provisions confer a wide discretion on the Tribunal as to whether to bifurcate the proceeding.2\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 26.\n\n7.\n\nIn exercising this discretion, the Respondent submits that it is undisputed that the guiding consideration \"*should be procedural efficiency and fairness*\".3 The Respondent also relies on *RWE AG RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. The Kingdom of the Netherlands*4 in order to submit that bifurcation is standard practice in ICSID proceeding and a decision to bifurcate on the basis of a jurisdictional objection should take into account the following factors:5\n\na. whether the objection is substantial or frivolous or a dilatory tactic;\n\nb. whether jurisdiction and merits are so intertwined as to make bifurcation impractical; and\n\nc. whether the objection, if successful, would materially reduce time and costs.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 26.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27, citing *RWE AG RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Claimants' Application for Bifurcation and Expedition,* ICSID Case No. ARB/21/4, 28 January 2022, \u00b6 21 (**Exhibit RL-001**).\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27.\n\n8.\n\nIn this instance, the Respondent submits that bifurcation is appropriate because its objections meet these criteria: \"(a) Moldova's jurisdictional objections are substantial; (b) they are entirely distinct from the merits; and (c) if successful, the objections will materially reduce time and costs as it would eliminate the entirety of Claimants' claims\".6\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 31.\n\n9.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits failed to include \"*facts and the law arguing that this Tribunal has jurisdiction*\" and that, on this basis alone, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction.7\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n10.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent's objections are that neither Claimant is an investor within the meaning of Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\") and that, as a consequence, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* to decide on the Claimants' claims (the \"**Objection(s)**\"). In particular, the Respondent submits that:8\n\n\"*1. RTI fails to qualify as an investor per ICSID Article 1(7)(a)(i) and applied in Articles 26 of the ECT, hence the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction rationae personae.*\n\n*2. Rotalin Gaz fails to qualify as an investor per Article 26 (7) of the ECT, hence the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction rationae personae*\".\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 30.\n\n11.\n\n***First***, regarding RTI Rotalin Gas Trading AG (\"**RTI**\"), the basis of the Respondent's Objection is that RTI does not come within the definition of an investor in Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT, which defines an investor as a company organized in accordance with the laws applicable in a contracting party.9\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent actually refers to Article 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT throughout its submission and refers to the definition set out in this provision. However, it appears to rely, in fact, on the requirements of Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent argues that RTI (i) is a holding company with no commercial activity in Liechtenstein; (ii) is not registered with the Liechtenstein Office for Economic Affairs; (iii) does not have a trading license; and (iv) has not appointed or declared a director with the Commercial Register.10 The Respondent relies on a declaration by Mr. Arnold Hanes, dated 19 July 2023, an attorney in Liechtenstein who states that, by reason of the above, RTI is not an 'active company' according to the laws applicable in Liechtenstein and contravenes the laws of Liechtenstein.11\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 44, 49, 51, 53.\n\nDeclaration of Mr. Arnold Hanes, \u00b6 19 (**Exhibit R-001**).\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent further states that although an investor is required to have a direct or indirect investment, RTI had no ability to conduct any activity and was consequently unable to invest directly.12\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.\n\n14.\n\nRelying on these assertions, the Respondent then argues that RTI could not have had any substantial business activities in Liechtenstein, by reason of which Article 17(1) of the ECT is applicable. Article 17(1) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\n*\"Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to: (1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organised.\"*\n\n15.\n\n***Second***, regarding Rotalin Gaz Trading S.R.L. (\"**Rotalin**\"), the Respondent challenges the Claimants' assertion that Rotalin is controlled by RTI.13 Relying on an excerpt from the website 'Open Money', the Respondent asserts that after the Request for Arbitration was submitted, in July 2022, the beneficial owner of Rotalin became a certain [REDACTED], a citizen of the United States of America.14\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 68, referring to Request for Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 84-86.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 67-80, citing Excerpt for Rotalin from Open Money (**Exhibit R-003**).\n\n16.\n\nOn the bases that RTI is not a company capable of commercial activity in Liechtenstein, and that the United States of America is not a contracting party to the ECT, the Respondent argues that Rotalin is not an investor within the meaning of Article 26(7) of the ECT. Article 26(7) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\n*\"An Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State\".*\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent submits that objections to jurisdiction *ratione personae* are considered a matter of jurisdiction rather than merit. It also submits that the determination of its Objections as to jurisdiction *ratione personae* does not require this Tribunal to analyze any of the factual evidence in relation to the alleged breaches.15\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86.\n\n18.\n\nFinally, regarding its Objections more generally, the Respondent submits that if the Tribunal were to uphold the Objections, they would eliminate the entirety of the Claimants' case and in that instance, there would be no prejudice to the Claimants from having bifurcated proceeding to resolve the Objections on a preliminary basis. The Respondent thus argues that bifurcation would materially reduce both time and costs for the Parties and the Tribunal and is the fair, efficient and economical way to proceed in this matter.16\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 87-94.\n\n*B. Claimants' Position*\n------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\na. Reject the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation; and\n\nb. Order the Respondent to pay the costs and expenses incurred in relation to the Request for Bifurcation including \"fees and costs of its legal counsel, experts and consultants and those of Claimants' employees\" and interest on the relevant costs from the date on which those costs are incurred until the date of the payment.17\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 54.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimants do not dispute the Tribunal's competence and authority to order bifurcation or disagree with the requirements for bifurcation as articulated by the Respondent.18 However, the Claimants do state that there is no presumption in favor of bifurcation under the ICSID Rules or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules19 and that the Request for Bifurcation fails to meet the requirements for bifurcation.\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 1.\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 1.\n\n21.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimants contend that the submissions contained in the Request for Arbitration dated 28 June 2022 are sufficient to ground jurisdiction in this case and that there is no requirement for the Memorial on the Merits to contain submissions on jurisdiction. In any event, according to the Claimants, the presence or absence of submissions on jurisdiction would not be a basis to justify a rejection of the Claimants' claim, and so is irrelevant for the purpose of a decision on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation.20\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 7-12.\n\n22.\n\nTurning to the requirements for bifurcation, the Claimants argue primarily that the Respondent has not met the first requirement, *i.e.*, the Respondent's Objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction are not substantial. The Claimants do not argue that these Objections, if found to be substantial, are so intertwined with the merits as to make bifurcation impractical, or if successful, would not materially reduce the time and costs of the proceeding.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent has failed to provide legal authority to support its Objections and submit that this failure indicates a lack of merit and should be sufficient for the Tribunal to dismiss the Request for Bifurcation. The Claimants submit that a decision to bifurcate the proceeding on the basis of an objection which is lacking in merit would only serve to delay the proceeding and add unnecessary time and costs.21\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.\n\n24.\n\nTurning to each of the Objections, the Claimants argue as follows.\n\n25.\n\n***First***, regarding the Respondent's Objections in relation to RTI, the Claimants submit that the only requirement introduced by Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT is that the company in question is organized according to the law applicable in a contracting party.22 In this instance, the Claimants submit that RTI is incorporated in the Liechtenstein Commercial Register as a shareholding company and functions as a holding company, in accordance with the laws of Liechtenstein.23\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 18.\n\n26.\n\nTherefore, according to the Claimants, it is irrelevant for the purposes of a determination of jurisdiction *ratione personae* whether RTI held a commercial license and whether the business activities to which the Respondent refers were those of Rotalin (not RTI) and were conducted in Moldova. The Claimants allege that there is no requirement that the investor organized according to the laws of a contracting party must directly engage in business in the host state, rather than through a subsidiary, as is the case here.24\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23.\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the Respondent's reliance on Article 17(1) of the ECT, the denial of benefits clause, in relation to RTI is misplaced. The Claimants submit that reliance on the denial of benefits clause is not a matter which pertains to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Claimants rely on *Canepa Green Energy Opportunities I, S.\u00e1 r.l. and Canepa Green Energy Opportunities II, S.\u00e1r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*25 in support of the proposition that Article 17(1) concerns the protective standards of the ECT and not the Tribunal's jurisdiction.26\n\n*Canepa Green Energy Opportunities I, S.\u00e1 r.l. and Canepa Green Energy Opportunities II, S.\u00e1r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/4, Procedural Order No. 3, 28 August 2020, \u00b6 90 (**Exhibit CL-125**).\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent has not exercised its right to deny any benefits to RTI pursuant to Article 17(1) and is no longer entitled to do so.27 The Claimants rely on the decision in *Anatolie Stati and others v. Republic of Kazakhstan*,28 among others, and argue that Article 17(1) will only apply if the Respondent invoked that provision before the dispute arose. In this instance, the Claimants state that the Respondent has not notified them of its right to deny their benefits under the ECT, and even after the Claimants notified them of the dispute, the Respondent proceeded to mediation under the Energy Community Secretariat's Dispute Resolution and Negotiation Centre.29 In the context of the mediation, the Claimants reserved the right to \"*continue the arbitration process under the Energy Charter Treaty if a settlement agreement is not reached by 21 March 2022.*\"30\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 29.\n\n*Anatolie Stati and others v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, SCC Case No. V116/2010, Award, 19 December 2013, \u00b6 716 (**Exhibit CL-131**).\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 35.\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 35\n\n29.\n\nFurther, the Claimants submit that Article 17(1) does not apply to RTI, because the definition of what constitutes substantial business must depend on the nature of the company, and that a small number of activities may be sufficient to meet the threshold for 'substantial business activity.'31 The Claimants also rely on the decision in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC. v. Republic of El Salvador*,32 in which the Tribunal found that a holding company could be engaged in substantial business activities if it has a board of directors, board minutes, a continuous physical presence and a bank account.33\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 38.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, \u00b6 4.72 (**Exhibit CL-135**).\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 40.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants submit that RTI is engaged in substantial business activities as follows:\n\n\"*RTI has substantial business activities as a holding company in Liechtenstein. As demonstrated already by Respondent's Exhibit R-001, RTI has a board of directors, which meets regularly. RTI also has a bank account with a Liechtenstein bank, pays taxes in Liechtenstein and maintains a continuous physical presence in the form of a physical address. RTI's long-time head of the management board,* [REDACTED] *is a Liechtenstein citizen, who resides and works in Liechtenstein.* [REDACTED], *was the key person establishing RTI's investment in Moldova and remains actively involved. In March 2008, the District of Hincesti awarded* [REDACTED] *the title 'Entrepreneur of the Year.' It was also* [REDACTED] *who met and communicated with Moldovan officials. Thus, RTI has substantial business activities in Liechtenstein pursuant to the predominant interpretation of Clause 17(1) ECT.*\"34\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 41.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that RTI is not effectively controlled by a national of a third state, and that the Respondent does not even allege that this could be the case.35\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 42-45.\n\n32.\n\n***Second***, regarding Rotalin, and the Respondent's Objection that Rotalin is under the ultimate control and beneficial ownership of a national of a third state, the Claimants argue that the Objection is predicated on the wrong law. The Claimants submit that it is the laws of Liechtenstein, not Moldova, which determine the beneficial ownership of Rotalin. The Claimants argue that under Liechtenstein law, RTI is a Liechtenstein company and, since it controls Rotalin as the sole shareholder, Rotalin is considered a foreign national under Articles 26(7) of the ECT and 1(6) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.36\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 51.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that, in any event, [REDACTED], who is the current head of the management board of RTI, is a dual national of the United Kingdom and United States of America, and that his UK nationality would grant Rotalin the same standing as the United Kingdom is also a contracting party to the ECT.37\n\nReply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 47-53.\n\n**III. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Parties' respective submissions, the Tribunal addresses in turn: (A) the Tribunal's power to order bifurcation and the standard it should apply; and (B) the application of the relevant standard in the present case.\n\n*A. Tribunal's Power to Order Bifurcation and Relevant Standard*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\n***First***, the Tribunal notes that both Parties to the dispute agree that this Tribunal holds the power to order bifurcation under Rule 45(4) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.38\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 26; Reply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 1.\n\n36.\n\nRule 45(4) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides as follows:\n\n*\"(4) Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceeding on the merits. The President of the Tribunal, after consultation with its other members, shall fix a time limit within which the parties may file observations on the objection\".*\n\n37.\n\nThis power to bifurcate a proceeding and hear preliminary objections to jurisdiction in an initial phase has been accepted and applied by other ICSID tribunals.39 The Tribunal is satisfied that it has the power to order bifurcation of some or all of the Objections under Rule 45(4).\n\n*See e.g.*, *Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 13 June 2013, \u00b6 37 (**Exhibit RL-004**).\n\n38.\n\n***Second***, as regards the appropriate standard to be applied in order to determine whether bifurcation is warranted, the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules do not provide any guidance as to which test a tribunal should apply in assessing whether or not to order bifurcation. Nevertheless, this is a matter on which prior ICSID tribunals have achieved some level of consensus40 and on which the Parties have not expressed any disagreement.41\n\n*See e.g., RWE AG RWE Eemshaven Holding II BV v. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, Claimants' Application for Bifurcation and Expedition, ICSID Case No. ARB/21/4*, 28 January 2022, \u00b6 44 (**Exhibit RL-001**); *Hela Schwarz GmbH v. People's Republic of China*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/19, Procedural Order No. 3 Decision on the Respondent Request for Bifurcation, 17 December 2018, (\"*Hela v. China*\") \u00b6 74 (**Exhibit CL-116**).\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 27; Reply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 1.\n\n39.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal will assess whether the Respondent's Objections (i) are *prima facie* serious and substantial; (ii) can be examined without prejudging, or delving into, the merits; and (iii) if upheld, would dispose of all or a significant portion of the Claimants' claims.\n\n40.\n\nThese criteria are to be considered through the lens of whether bifurcation would enhance procedural efficiency and fairness.42\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 23; Reply to Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 1. *See also*, *Hela v. China*, \u00b6 74 (\"The Tribunal agrees that it should have regard to all relevant circumstances and be guided in its assessment by considerations of economy, efficiency and fairness\").\n\n*B. Application of the Relevant Standard*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nAs noted above, the first criterion to consider in determining whether bifurcation is warranted is whether the Objections are *prima facie* serious.43 The rationale behind this criterion is to ensure that bifurcation is not ordered to consider objections that have no reasonable chance of success or are otherwise frivolous, vexatious or clearly without merit; bifurcation in such circumstances would almost certainly result in a loss rather than a gain of procedural efficiency.\n\n*See above*, at \u00b6 39.\n\n42.\n\nImportantly, the inquiry as to the seriousness of the Objections is on a *prima facie* basis. At this stage of the proceeding, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine the ultimate seriousness of the Objections, and nothing in this decision shall be read to constitute or imply such a determination.\n\n43.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal finds that the Objections as thus far articulated do not meet this first criterion. In its Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent has failed to particularize its Objections in a manner that would allow the Tribunal to find, on a prima *facie basis*, that these Objections are serious. In particular, the Respondent has failed to articulate:\n\na. regarding RTI, on what basis the Tribunal should take into account the additional factors referred to by the Respondent (*i.e.*, the fact that RTI is said to (i) be a holding company with no commercial activity in Liechtenstein; (ii) not be registered with the Liechtenstein Office for Economic Affairs; (iii) have no trading license; and (iv) have failed to appoint or declare a director with the Commercial Register) in assessing whether RTI falls under the definition of an investor in Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT;\n\nb. also regarding RTI, what are the requirements for the denial of benefit clause in Article 17(1) of the ECT, and whether they are met in the case at hand; and\n\nc. regarding Rotalin, on what basis it would fail to qualify as investor under Article 26(7) of the ECT taking into account any (alleged) control by [REDACTED].\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal stresses that the above finding does not preclude the Respondent from further developing any jurisdictional objections it may have in its upcoming Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Preliminary Objections.\n\n45.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal finds that the Objections do not meet this first criterion, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to address the other requirements for bifurcation set out above.44\n\n*See above*, at \u00b6 39.\n\n46.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the bifurcation requested by the Respondent is likely to result in greater procedural efficiency or enhanced fairness. As such, it concludes that bifurcation is not warranted in the present case.\n\n47.\n\nFinally, given the *prima facie* nature of the findings above, and considering the overall circumstances, the Tribunal finds that a decision on costs relating to the Request for Bifurcation is to be reserved.\n\n*C. Decision*\n-------------\n\n48.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. The Respondent's Request for Bifurcation is dismissed; and\n\nb. The Tribunal reserves its decision on costs relating to the Request for Bifurcation.\n\nDate: 11 October 2023"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures and the Claimants\u2019 Request for Reconsideration)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2023-12-11T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures and the Claimants\u2019 Request for Reconsideration)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

RELEVANT FACTS**\n----------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal provides an illustrative summary of the facts upon which the Request for Provisional Measures is based. This summary does not constitute any finding by the Tribunal on any facts disputed by the Parties. A more detailed analysis of the facts relevant to the Tribunal's decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures is contained in Section IV.\n\n15.\n\nSince 2016, Rotalin has been under an obligation to supply gas at regulated prices within its distribution area under the so-called Public Service Obligation (\"**PSO**\").\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 29 March 2023, ANRE invited Rotalin to apply for individual end-user supply tariffs by 12 April 2023.1\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 17.\n\n17.\n\nOn 31 May 2023, the Emergency Commission of the Moldovan Government issued Decision No. 72/2023 (\"**Decision No. 72**\") which introduced a single payment for all final consumers terminating or changing supply contracts.2 Following the issuance of Decision No. 72, Rotalin is said to have experienced some difficulty with acquiring new customers because potential customers \"*were unable or unwilling to pay the extra fee*.\"3\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 19.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 19 \u2013 22.\n\n18.\n\nIn July 2023, Rotalin (i) submitted an application for an individual end-user supply tariff,4 and (ii) applied for an adjustment of its distribution tariffs.5\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 26.\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 August 2023, ANRE published a draft decision on Rotalin's application which allegedly applied end-user supply tariffs lower than those which applied to MoldovaGaz or other gas suppliers in Moldova.6 As a consequence, Rotalin sought to withdraw its application and requested to be relieved from the PSO.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 27.\n\n20.\n\nOn 5 September 2023, ANRE issued two decisions: (i) Decision No. 522/2023 on the adjustment of regulated tariffs for the natural gas distribution service (\"**Decision No. 522**\"), and (ii) Decision No. 523/2023 on the approval of regulated prices for the supply of natural gas by Rotalin (\"**Decision No. 523**\").\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants state that while Decision No. 522 increased Rotalin's distribution tariff, it did not do so by enough of a margin to meet Rotalin's needs. Decision No. 523 set an end-user supply tariff which was 35% lower than the tariff applicable to MoldovaGaz. According to the Claimants, this tariff was so low that it failed to cover Rotalin's costs and allow for any profit.7\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 31 \u2013 33.\n\n22.\n\nOn 8 September 2023, Rotalin informed ANRE that it was no longer able to meet its PSO after 1 October 2023, due to the change in the end-user supply tariffs in Decision No. 523.8 Rotalin instead requested to be released from the PSO, so that it would be in a position to supply gas to end-users at a more competitive price.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 34.\n\n23.\n\nOn 13 September 2023, Rotalin filed a preliminary challenge to Decision No. 523 with ANRE on the basis that the decision was unlawful and contradicted the applicable regulatory framework. ANRE rejected Rotalin's preliminary challenge on 28 September 2023.9\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 35 \u2013 36.\n\n24.\n\nOn 22 September 2023, Rotalin reiterated to ANRE that it had to cease its supply operation and PSO effective 1 October 2023, and urged ANRE to take all necessary measures to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to consumers.10 Rotalin indicated that it would commit to cooperate with the supplier of last resort designated by ANRE.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 40.\n\n25.\n\nANRE's administrative council met on 26 September 2023 and issued a prescription requiring Rotalin to continue with its obligation to supply gas to end-users, and to notify the public and the supplier of last resort of this development.11\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 42; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 49 \u2013 50.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 September 2023, after Rotalin had failed to execute the prescription of 26 September 2023, ANRE issued a second prescription on the same terms.12\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 52 \u2013 53.\n\n27.\n\nIn the days following 1 October 2023, Rotalin ceased supplying gas to roughly 21,000 end-users.13\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 55 \u2013 56; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 20; Rotalin's Balancing Reports (**Exhibit C- 311**).\n\n28.\n\nOn 2 October 2023, following a meeting with Rotalin, ANRE issued a decision to suspend Rotalin's supply license (\"**Suspension Decision**\"), giving it three months to comply with the demand to reinstate the supply to end-users.14 The Suspension Decision also declared MoldovaGaz as the supplier of last resort for Rotalin's customers.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 44; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 57 \u2013 58.\n\n29.\n\nANRE's legal department commenced proceedings on 4 October 2023 before the Chisinau District Court (\"**Court**\"), requesting that the Court rule on \"*(i) the legality and validity of ANRE's three-month (3) suspension of Rotalin's License; and (ii) ANRE's demand that Rotalin recommence its natural gas supply activity to its customers from the date of the Suspension Decision.*\"15\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 60 \u2013 65.\n\n30.\n\nOn 18 October 2023, Rotalin submitted a statement of defence in the proceedings before the Court.16\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 88 \u2013 96.\n\n31.\n\nOn 21 October 2023, the Court issued a non-reasoned ruling which upheld the Suspension Decision.17 The reasoned decision is due to be issued within 45 days.18\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 87.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Mihai Murgulet, 30 October 2023, \u00b6 26.\n\n32.\n\nOn 17 November 2023, ANRE held a meeting in which it decided to postpone the decision to impose a fine on Rotalin.19 On the same day, ANRE nonetheless published a press release on its website stating that Rotalin was fined in the amount of 5% of its annual turnover.20 The press release was removed from ANRE's website within minutes of its posting.21\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, p. 1; Respondent's Objection, p. 2.\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, p. 1; Respondent's Objection, pp. 2, 4; Witness Statement of Natalia Baiesu, 21 November 2023, \u00b6\u00b6 30 \u2013 31.\n\nRespondent's Objection, pp. 2, 4.\n\n**III. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n*A. Claimants' Position*\n------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\n\"*(i) Order Respondent not to withdraw Rotalin's License for Supply No. 000679.*\n\n*(ii) Order Respondent to lift the suspension Rotalin's License for Supply No. 000679.*\n\n*(iii) Order Respondent to abstain from imposing any fines related to the ceasing of supply by Rotalin from 1 October 2023.*\n\n*(iv) Order Respondent to suspend ANRE Decision no. 523.*\n\n*(v) Order Respondent to compensate Claimants for their costs arising out of the provisional measure request in an amount to be specified later together with interest thereon.*\"22\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 82.\n\n34.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants argue that Decision No. 523 threatens the integrity of the present arbitral proceedings and the Claimants' procedural rights because the suspension of Rotalin's supply license and the impending termination of that license will likely cause financial harm to Rotalin and impact the Claimants' ability to finance these proceedings.\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, ANRE's inappropriately low supply tariffs and the Suspension Decision, which give rise to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, are distinct from the main claims the Claimants brought in these proceedings.23 The main claims instead concern the under-recovery of the Claimants' historic investment costs and damages from Moldova's failure to open the market despite repeated promises.24 Contrary to the Respondent's suggestion that the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures is an amendment of the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, the requested measures do not remedy the historic under-recovery or lack of access to the Moldovan gas market.25\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 8 \u2013 13.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 14 \u2013 16.\n\n36.\n\nInstead, the rights that the Claimants seek to protect by way of their Request for Provisional Measures are the following: (i) a right to maintain the *status quo* that existed prior to ANRE's Decision No. 523; (ii) the non-aggravation of the dispute through further violations of the Claimants' rights under the ECT; (iii) the right to be treated fairly and equitably and the right not to be expropriated, which are triggered by ANRE's misapplication of the tariff methodology; (iv) the right to preserve the integrity of the proceedings and equality of arms, arising from the Respondent's abuse of its regulatory powers; and (v) the right to be heard, given that the suspension of Rotalin's license potentially threatens the Claimants' ability to finance this arbitration.26\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 43 \u2013 44.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants also do not consider it necessary to allow additional time for the Respondent to respond to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures as that would defeat the purpose of a provisional measures application. According to the Claimants, the time already allotted for these submissions is more than sufficient.27\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n38.\n\nFinally, the Claimants assert that none of the measures requested would serve to put Rotalin in a better position than the one which existed prior to Decision No. 523. Under those conditions, Rotalin operated at a loss and in difficult circumstances. This would still be the case even if the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures were granted, and the only effect would be that Rotalin would not suffer the permanent loss of its supply business.28\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 15 \u2013 16.\n\n39.\n\nIn its Request for Reconsideration, the Claimants argued that ANRE's 17 November 2023 press release, announcing that Rotalin was fined in the amount of 5% of its annual turnover, clearly shows that the decision was taken by ANRE in advance, without even hearing Rotalin, and was also communicated to the PR department of ANRE in advance.29 Not only is this a \"*stark violation of due process*,\" but it is also \"*evidence of the lack of applying the rule of law in proceedings initiated against Rotalin*.\"30 According to the Claimants, this conduct demonstrates the need for provisional measures and shows the clear intent to eliminate Rotalin from the market and to take its investments.31\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 5.\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 5.\n\nPower to Order Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants rely on Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules (2006) which provides as follows:\n\n*\"(1) Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\"*32\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 48.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants assert that there is nothing in the ECT which precludes the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion or competence to order provisional measures in these proceedings.33\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 48.\n\n42.\n\nAs to whether the Tribunal ought to order provisional measures in this instance, the Claimants refer to *Sergei Paushok*, *CJSC Golden East Co. and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Co. v. Mongolia*34 and *Alasdair Ross Anderson et al v. Republic of Costa Rica*.35 Relying on these decisions, the Claimants identify the following conditions for an order of provisional measures:36\n\na. *prima facie* jurisdiction;\n\nb. *prima facie* establishment of the case;\n\nc. urgency, or the need to avoid irreparable harm;\n\nd. imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity), and\n\ne. proportionality.\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Co. and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Co. v. Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 45 (**Exhibit CL-139**).\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson et al v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Decision on Provisional Measures, 5 November 2008, \u00b6 20 (**Exhibit CL 140**).\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 49 \u2013 51.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants submit that these conditions have been met in this case.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the rights they seek to protect by way of the requested measures are procedural rights, namely \"*the right to be heard, the right to a fair proceeding and the protection of the integrity of the arbitration as a whole \u2026*\"37 The Claimants assert that there are precedents for the protection of these kind of rights by the grant of orders of specific performance. The measures which the Claimants seek are intended to preserve the *status quo* in these proceedings.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 58 \u2013 62.\n\n45.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that ANRE and the Moldovan courts are the proper forum for any dispute in relation to Decision No. 523 and the suspension of Rotalin's supply license, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal is entitled to order provisional measures even where national courts are also entitled to exercise jurisdiction.38\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 23 \u2013 25.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal is competent to decide on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures and that it does not require extensive expert evidence to do so. The Tribunal is always able to revoke or change any provisional measures ordered if the Respondent can show that they were not necessary or the risk for which they were ordered no longer exists.39\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 26 \u2013 27.\n\nJurisdiction and Merits\n-----------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the standard to establish *prima facie* jurisdiction is not a high one. In this case, they argue that the threshold has been met by the registration of the proceedings by the ICSID Secretariat following a \"*basic review of the jurisdictional requirements.*\"40\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 52 \u2013 53.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants also refer to the Request for Arbitration, the Memorial on the Merits, and the Reply to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation in asserting that these documents make out a *prima facie* case for jurisdiction.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the test to determine whether there is a *prima facie* case on the merits is for the Tribunal to consider whether facts as they have been presented by the Claimants could give rise to a violation of the relevant treaty. In this instance, the Claimants submit that the facts of this case, as they have been presented in the Memorial on the Merits and in the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, would give rise to breaches of the ECT if upheld.41 On this basis, the Claimants assert that a *prima facie* case on the merits has been made in these proceedings.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 55 \u2013 56.\n\n50.\n\nMoreover, the Respondents' argument that the Claimants deliberately caused the suspension of its own license disregards the clear connection that exists between the inappropriate supply tariffs and the suspension of the supply license.42\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 41 \u2013 42.\n\nNecessity\n---------\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the requesting party in an application for provisional measures must demonstrate the existence of a \"*sufficient risk or threat that grave or serious harm will occur if provisional measures are not granted.*\"43\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 63.\n\n52.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the risk which arises out of the suspension of Rotalin's supply license is that Rotalin will suffer the permanent loss of its entire client base to MoldovaGaz. Furthermore, even if Rotalin would later receive a new supply license, Rotalin's customers are likely to remain with MoldovaGaz due to the effective closing of the gas market and the introduction of a fee for changing suppliers. This, the Claimants argue, would aggravate the dispute and effectively create a new claim for indirect expropriation.44\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 64.\n\n53.\n\nGiven that Decision No. 523 makes it impossible for Rotalin to carry out business profitably, the inevitable outcome is that Rotalin will suffer financial duress and risk insolvency.45 The Claimants emphasize that they have been responsible for financing these proceedings to date and, thus, argue that if Rotalin suffers financial duress, that will likely directly impact these proceedings.46\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 66.\n\n54.\n\nThis risk would be reduced by granting the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures. In that scenario, Rotalin would be able to continue carrying on its business in a sustainable manner and continue these arbitration proceedings. Consequently, the Claimants argue that the measures are necessary to protect Rotalin's procedural rights and the integrity of this arbitration.47\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 67 \u2013 68.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"*monetary compensation does not suffice in the case at hand*.\"48 Instead, the Claimants are seeking to reinstate the *status quo ante,* namely to be able to continue their operations.49\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 51.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 51.\n\n56.\n\nWhile the Respondent argues that there is no risk of irreparable harm in the instant case, the Claimants submit that this is not the appropriate standard. They propose that:\n\n*\"It is therefore not 'irreparable harm' (as all harm may be compensable) but 'sufficient risk or threat that grave or serious harm will occur if provisional measures are not granted' that the requesting party must demonstrate.\"*50\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 54.\n\n57.\n\nThe standard of sufficient risk has been met by the facts of this case. The Respondent has failed to establish why the measures requested are not necessary. According to the Claimants, the assertion that Rotalin could have gone to the Moldovan courts is irrelevant.\n\nUrgency\n-------\n\n58.\n\nRegarding urgency, the Claimants submit that this requirement overlaps with necessity and the risk of harm discussed above. Urgency exists where the requesting party will likely suffer imminent harm, or \"*at least harm that would arise before the award is rendered.*\"51\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 69.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants assert that unless Rotalin can renew its supply business in the short term, it will likely suffer significant financial harm, which will in turn impact these proceedings. The relevant circumstances are summarised by the Claimants as follows:\n\n*\"(70) \u2026 The newly adjusted distribution tariff does not accord for the negative developments in Rotalin's distribution volumes in the past months. Distribution is also not a reliable business: the only customer is MoldovaGaz, which has repeatedly refused to pay fair distribution tariffs to Rotalin. It follows that every day without the supply business is a risk to Rotalin's existence, and, consequently, the existence of the arbitration. The financial damages will only be amplified by the fines ANRE announced will be imposed on Rotalin due to the supply stop. In the worst case, once Rotalin enters insolvency proceedings, the damage becomes irreparable and permanent.*\n\n*(71) Lastly, ANRE has already announced that it will withdraw Rotalin's license. This would be an effective point of no return for Rotalin, as it would lose its customer base for good.\"*52\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 70 \u2013 71.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants also state that Rotalin is unable to restore supply for as long as the supply tariffs continue to apply.53 As such, the suspension is not temporary and, considering the Respondent's other conduct, is a continuation of a clear desire to squeeze Rotalin out of the market.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 71 \u2013 73.\n\n61.\n\nFurther, none of the options proposed by the Respondent are viable. In this regard, the Claimants argue as follows:\n\n*\"\u2022 'appealing to the Moldovan courts': Not only does Rotalin have a choice where to request provisional measures pursuant to Article 46 ICSID AF Rules, but it is aware of the Fork in the Road Clause provided in the ECT. Respondent cannot force Claimants into domestic court proceedings which could jeopardize their right to arbitrate under the ECT.*\n\n*\u2022 'negotiating a termination of its obligation with ANRE' has already failed, as explained in the Request for Provisional Measures. ANRE has only applied with aggression or disinterest when Rotalin attempted to negotiate alternative solutions. This is evident from the hostile letter Rotalin received from ANRE during the application process for the supply tariffs, from ANRE's silence when Rotalin was seeking alternative solutions by purchasing gas from EnergoCom, and, finally, from ANRE's threatening letters refusing all of Rotalin's requests regarding the release from the PSO.*\n\n*\u2022 'seeking the relief of* [sic] *this Tribunal' would mean that it is too late and the dispute has been aggravated. It is exactly this outcome that the provisional measures should prevent.\"*54\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 74.\n\nProportionality\n---------------\n\n62.\n\nRegarding the criterion of proportionality, the Claimants submit that any provisional measures granted by a tribunal must not outweigh the justification for granting them. As such, the Tribunal has a duty to consider the harm sought to be prevented and balance it against the harm likely to be caused to the counterparty by the grant of the provisional measures.55\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 74.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the grant of the provisional measures sought in this case will not impact the Respondent's sovereign or regulatory powers, and that there are \"*no monetary, economic, or other repercussions for the Respondent*.\"56\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 79.\n\n64.\n\nFurther, the Claimants argue that the grant of the provisional measures, and the continuation of Rotalin's supply business would ultimately be to the benefit of the Moldovan gas market, as well as being consistent with the Respondent's own policies.57 According to the Claimants, the Respondent would be able to reinstate Decision No. 523 without suffering any financial harm.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 74 \u2013 78.\n\n65.\n\nThat said, the Claimants rely on *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*,58in arguing that this Tribunal would still be entitled to grant provisional measures even if it entailed interfering with some aspects of the Respondent's sovereign powers.\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, 29 June 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71 (**Exhibit CL-149**).\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that there is no risk of harm to the public if the measures requested are granted. To the contrary, Rotalin would be able to supply gas to its consumers at the price that all other consumers in Moldova pay. The harm to the public, if any, arises from Moldova endorsing MoldovaGaz's monopoly.59\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 78.\n\n67.\n\nFurther, there is no risk of harm to ANRE and the Moldovan courts. In granting the measures sought, this Tribunal would not prejudge the legality of either the suspension of Rotalin's license or Decision No. 523.60\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 79.\n\nGood Faith\n----------\n\n68.\n\nIn responding to the Respondent's good faith argument, the Claimants observe that the relevant case law does not include a requirement of a lack of frivolous intent.61 While the Claimants acknowledge that a certain element of good faith always plays a role when assessing the validity of a party's request, the Claimants submit that the Respondent's allegation of pretextual behavior is unsubstantiated and categorically flawed.62\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants are not seeking a justified exit, instead they are seeking measures which would allow them to remain in the Moldovan gas market. Rotalin simply could no longer continue with its supply business following Decision No. 523, and the cessation of supply was not an act of retaliation or an attempt to trigger the suspension of its license.63\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 30 \u2013 34.\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimants point to another supplier, Natural Gaz D.C., who did not have its license suspended by ANRE when it was unable to supply its customers in June 2021.64\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 35.\n\nPreservation of the *Status Quo*\n--------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's arguments that the grant of the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures would be tantamount to improving the Claimants' circumstances.\n\n72.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants argue that (i) there is no improvement of the Claimants' situation should the provisional measures be granted and (ii) this Tribunal is entitled to protect the Claimants where the State's administrative, judicial, or regulatory power is exercised in an unjustified manner.65\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 58 \u2013 60.\n\n73.\n\nHere, according to the Claimants, the imposition of supply tariffs which made it impossible for Rotalin to continue its business and the ultimate suspension (with the threat of withdrawal) of the Claimants' supply license were an unjustified exercise of the Respondent's regulatory and administrative power. Consequently, the *status quo* to be protected is the state of affairs that existed prior to Decision No. 523.66\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 63.\n\n*B. Respondent's Position*\n--------------------------\n\n74.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent criticizes the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures because, in the Respondent's view, it represents an attempt to introduce an additional claim, and seek additional remedies, and so should be dismissed out of hand. The Respondent also requests that the Tribunal set a schedule to address these additional claims concerning Decisions No. 72, 522 and 523.67\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 1 \u2013 2.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent notes that it is unable to develop a comprehensive legal argument on the tariff issue in the nominal time allocated for the response to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures. The Respondent therefore requests additional time to put forward a more comprehensive defense to these arguments.68\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 27 \u2013 32; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent also criticizes the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures on the basis that it is frivolous, and \"*merely a pretext for Rotalin to increase the value of their initial damage claim, which is an illegal, prohibited conduct.*\"69\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 86 \u2013 97.\n\n77.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the true purpose of the application is to furnish the Claimants with a way to exit the Moldovan gas market. In their view, rather than terminating its services to the end-users, the Claimants could have (and should have) appealed ANRE's decision to this Tribunal or the Moldovan courts. By choosing to suspend its services, knowing that ANRE would be obliged to suspend and ultimately terminate its supply license, the Claimants deliberately sought to justify its breach of the PSO by characterising ANRE's actions as retaliatory rather than regulatory.70\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 87.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants are not entitled to circumvent their obligations under Moldovan law because these proceeding are pending, or to use their Request for Provisional Measures to avoid responsibility.71\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 95.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent thus requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to compensate the Respondent for the costs incurred in responding to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures.72\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 280 \u2013 282.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures has now been overtaken by events. Notably, the Respondent points to the fact that the Court upheld the validity of the Suspension Decision in its decision of 21 October 2021. The Respondent submits that the \"*Claimants properly availed themselves of the jurisdiction*\" of the Court by filing an action in which the Claimants *inter alia* requested the reversal of the 21 October 2023 decision, to nullify all ANRE decisions leading up to ANRE's Suspension Decision, to void the Suspension Decision, and to stay all administrative proceedings which could lead to the imposition of fines against the Claimants.73 Moreover, given that the Court's decision is subject to Rotalin's appeal, \"*the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction while these very same issues are still the object of an active litigation process in Moldova*.\"74\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 106 \u2013 107, 120.\n\n81.\n\nThus, the Respondent argues that the Claimants are now barred by the fork in the road clause in the ECT, and that in any event, the Moldovan courts are better equipped to determine issues relating to Decision No. 523 and ANRE's Suspension Decision.75\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 108 \u2013 113.\n\n82.\n\nIn the context of the Claimants' Request for Reconsideration, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to provide any justification to substantiate a reversal of the Tribunal's decision.76 The Claimants have not cited to any case law in support of their position, nor have they provided any facts to demonstrate a compelling \"*change in circumstances*\" that would undermine the fundamental basis of the Tribunal's decision.77 The Claimants base their request solely on \"*an inadvertent erroneous posting on ANRE's website*\" that was removed within fifteen minutes of discovering the error.78\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 2 (citing to *Nova Group Investments, B.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/19, Procedural Order No. 7 Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of, 27 March 2017, \u00b6 31 (**Exhibit RL-048**).\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 4.\n\n83.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants' Request for Reconsideration failed to mention that at the 17 November 2023 meeting, no fines were imposed on the Claimants and instead, ANRE decided to stay the administrative proceedings in line with the Claimants' request.79 This was to the Claimants' benefit, not their prejudice.80\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 4; Witness Statement of Natalia Baiesu, 21 November 2023, \u00b6\u00b6 24 \u2013 27.\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 5.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent accordingly requests that the Tribunal (i) issue a ruling that the Claimants' 18 November 2023 email is an improper procedural submission, and (ii) reaffirm its original decision denying the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures.81\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 5.\n\nPower to Order Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules provides for the Tribunal's power to grant provisional measures. The Respondent, however, emphasizes that provisional measures ought not to be granted lightly, in particular where the measures risk infringing on State sovereignty.82\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 70 \u2013 75.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that the Tribunal may order provisional measures to preserve the right to procedural integrity.83\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 77.\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal must first be satisfied that the Request for Provisional Measures is not brought frivolously, and subsequently must establish:\n\n*\"(i) whether Rotalin has a right that requires preservation in the arbitration;*\n\n*(ii) there are circumstances of necessity to avoid irreparable harm being caused to Rotalin by Moldova against whom provisional measures are sought;*\n\n*(iii) there must be circumstances of urgency;*\n\n*(iv) the provisional measures requested must be proportional;*\n\n*(v) the provisional measures requested must not be too broad; and*\n\n*(vi) any recommendation for the provisional measures must not prejudge the merits of the case.\"*84\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 84.\n\n88.\n\nContrary to the Claimants' arguments, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal need not consider whether the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction. From the Respondent's perspective, that is a \"*biased and self-sustaining*\" standard.85\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 104 \u2013 105.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to enjoin a State from performing its legal, judicial, or administrative activities. The Respondent also contends that the proper forum for a challenge to ANRE's decision is the Moldovan courts. The Respondent argues that the effect of any decision by this Tribunal as to the status of the supply license would be to strip ANRE of its role and functions under Moldovan law.86 This Tribunal risks interfering with the role of the Moldovan courts and potentially creating duplicative and inconsistent decisions. On this basis, the Respondent submits that the Suspension Decision should be addressed by the Moldovan courts.87\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 194 \u2013 211.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 212 \u2013 214.\n\nRights which Require Preservation\n---------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes the right which the Claimants seek to preserve as a right to the restoration of Rotalin's supply license, or more broadly, a right to the specific performance of the supply license. The Respondent argues that no such right exists.88\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 110 \u2013 114.\n\n91.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Rotalin has a duty to provide natural gas to the public at prices set by ANRE. The Respondent refers to Articles 11(1), 13(3), 15(c) and 80(4) of Moldova's Law on Natural Gas No. 108/2016 (\"**Law on Natural Gas**\") which collectively requires suppliers to fulfil their PSO by providing natural gas according to parameters set by ANRE without interruption.89\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 116 \u2013 119.\n\n92.\n\nConversely, ANRE has an obligation to protect consumers by monitoring and controlling the way in which license holders comply with the Law on Natural Gas.90 Pursuant to this duty, ANRE is empowered to suspend licenses where the license holder has breached its obligations under the Law on Natural Gas.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 120 \u2013 121.\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Rotalin breached its duty under the Law on Natural Gas and ignored ANRE's prescriptions of 26 and 28 September 2023.91\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 128 \u2013 132.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Rotalin's suspension of gas supply on 1 October 2023 was a breach of Rotalin's PSO under Article 89 of the Law on Natural Gas, and that this breach \"*jeopardized national security, life and public health in Moldova*.\"92\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 132.\n\n95.\n\nANRE's Suspension Decision, which gives Rotalin three months to remedy the breach, is in line with the Law on Natural Gas. In particular, the Respondent cites Article 105(b) of the Law on Natural Gas which requires ANRE to suspend a license and designate another license holder to carry out the licensed activity \"*in the event of an exceptional situation in the natural gas sector*.\"93 According to the Respondent, Rotalin's decision to suspend its PSO is an exceptional situation because this cessation in supply affected more than 20,000 consumers.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 136.\n\n96.\n\nFurther, the Respondent asserts that ANRE commenced legal proceedings, and that Rotalin was entitled to challenge the Suspension Decision before the Moldovan courts.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent thus submits that the right which the Claimants assert in their Request for Provisional Measures is in fact a breach of its obligation under Moldovan law to which ANRE has responded to protect the public.94\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 140 \u2013 145.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Rotalin's deliberate breach of its PSO has no connection to the Claimants' ability to argue its tariff claims in these proceedings. According to the Respondent, the breach was premeditated and carried out with the knowledge that ANRE would have to suspend the license and with the ultimate aim to fabricate a basis to bring this Request for Provisional Measures.95\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 148 \u2013 152; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 56 \u2013 86.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Rotalin was not forced to cease its supply operations and that the Claimants already have a claim in this arbitration concerning ANRE's tariff methodology. Consequently, the Claimants may pursue that claim with or without the Suspension Decision and to decide otherwise would \"*prejudice Moldova in a fair consideration of these proceedings*.\"96\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 165.\n\n100.\n\nRelying on *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Spain,*97 the Respondent also argues, in the alternative, that for the Claimants to be entitled to specific performance, they would have had to seek remedies in the Moldovan judicial system. Rotalin would have to establish that the Suspension Decision is illegal, failing which there can be no right to specific performance.98\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 October 1999, \u00b6\u00b612-14 (**Exhibit RL-033**).\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 166 \u2013 168.\n\nNecessity\n---------\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants fail to meet the requirement that provisional measures only be granted in urgent situations where they are necessary to prevent the loss of rights.\n\n102.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent asserts that the only purpose of the Request for Provisional Measures is to seek monetary compensation. The Respondent submits that (i) the risks the Claimants asserted in their Request for Provisional Measures are purely financial risks, and (ii) the Tribunal ought to abide by the principle that losses which may be compensated in the final award do not warrant protection through provisional measures.99 The Respondent considers this to be sufficient grounds to dismiss the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 170 \u2013 172.\n\n103.\n\nSeparately, the Respondent urges the Tribunal to apply the standard of \"irreparable harm.\" As to what constitutes irreparable harm, the Respondent relies on the decision in *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*,100 where the Tribunal described irreparable harm as one which cannot be remedied by an award of damages.\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 156 (**Exhibit RL-032**).\n\n104.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is no irreparable harm here. Rotalin is entitled to participate in the proceedings before the Moldovan courts regarding the legality of the Suspension Decision. Rotalin also has an opportunity to remedy its breach within the three-month suspension period. Rotalin is not entitled to pick and choose which Moldovan laws to comply with or to have the Tribunal sanction its non-compliance.101\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 178 \u2013 193.\n\nPreservation of the *Status Quo*\n--------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the purpose of provisional measures is to preserve the *status quo*, and to prevent the aggravation of a dispute, not to improve the situation of the requesting party or to afford them more rights than those to which they otherwise would be entitled.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that not every change in circumstance during an arbitration, even if it possibly increases the harm already complained of, is a fresh violation of the parties' rights.102\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 237.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the measures sought by the Claimants in this case aim to improve their situation and will be equivalent to the effect of a final decision. Rotalin has an obligation to comply with Moldovan law, meet its PSO and ensure continued supply of gas, but it has failed to do so. What the Claimants are seeking is to change the *status quo* by seeking measures which would relieve them of their obligations under Moldovan law.103\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 224 \u2013 233.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent relies *inter alia* on *Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic*104and *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*105 in support of the proposition that the Claimants have failed to show any circumstances which threaten the *status quo* or the Tribunal's ability to grant relief at the end of the proceedings.106\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Decision on Provisional Measures, 15 February 2004, \u00b6 37 (**Exhibit RL-037**).\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 45 (**Exhibit RL-026**).\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 235 \u2013 241.\n\nUrgency\n-------\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to show the existence of an urgency. The Respondent refers to *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*107 in support of the argument that an urgency exists where there is a risk of prejudice to the rights of the requesting party before a final decision is taken in the arbitral proceedings.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, \u00b6 8 (**Exhibit RL-041**).\n\n110.\n\nHere, the Respondent argues that there is no risk of prejudice: Rotalin itself triggered the suspension of its supply license and can remedy the breach and have its license reinstated by restoring the supply of gas within three months.108\n\nProportionality\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 242 \u2013 252.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures ought to be dismissed because the measures sought fail to meet the proportionality test. Like the Claimants, the Respondent advocates for a balancing of interests to ensure that the harm caused by the provisional measures does not outweigh the harm sought to be prevented by them.109\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 268 \u2013 272.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal must consider both the harm which has resulted from Rotalin's conduct, namely the suspension of the supply of gas, and the harm likely to be caused by granting the requested measures. If this Tribunal were to grant the measures sought, ANRE will be harmed by the usurpation of its regulatory and administrative functions. Similarly, the Moldovan courts will be deprived of their jurisdiction to determine the validity of ANRE's decision.110\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 275 \u2013 279.\n\n113.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this potential encroachment on the Respondent's sovereignty outweighs the Claimants' interest in obtaining the requested provisional measures.\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal makes a number of preliminary remarks.\n\n115.\n\n***First***, the Tribunal notes that both the Claimants and the Respondent have requested that the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures be decided on the papers without the need for an oral hearing.111 The Tribunal has carefully considered the arguments and the evidence before it on the papers and, on this basis, has decided to dismiss the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures for the reasons set out below. However, this does not prevent either Party from seeking further relief, if and when necessary.\n\nEmail from the Claimants to the Tribunal Secretary, 31 October 2023; Email from the Respondent to the Tribunal Secretary, 31 October 2023.\n\n116.\n\n***Second***, the Tribunal wishes to address the Respondent's argument that the Claimants are seeking to impermissibly amend their Memorial on the Merits through the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures.112 The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have not formulated a request to amend their Memorial on the Merits. The Tribunal will deal with such a request if and when filed.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 1; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 27.\n\n117.\n\n***Third***, concerning the Respondent's argument that it required additional time to respond to the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures, the Tribunal is of the view that the briefing schedule provided to the Parties was adequate for a provisional measures application. As discussed in further detail below, the purpose of a provisional measures application is not to assess the merits of the case in detail. The Tribunal only does so on a *prima facie* basis.113\n\nSee below at \u00b6\u00b6 137 *et seq.*\n\n118.\n\nThese preliminary remarks having been made, the Tribunal will now address whether it is vested with the power to grant provisional measures in Section IV(A), before setting out the relevant legal standard in Section IV(B), and subsequently applying that standard to the case at hand in Section IV(C).\n\n*A. Power to Grant Preliminary Measures*\n----------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules vests the Tribunal with the power to grant provisional measures. Paragraph 1 of Article 46 specifically provides that:\n\n\"*Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\"*\n\n120.\n\nNothing in the arbitration agreement, found in Article 26 of the ECT, prohibits the granting of provisional measures.114\n\n*See also* Claimants' Request, \u00b6 48; Claimants' Request for Arbitration, 28 June 2022, \u00b6 78.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties do not challenge that the Tribunal may in principle grant provisional measures.115 Instead, the Respondent argues that either (i) the Tribunal lacks the capacity to grant the Claimants' requested relief because it would interfere with Moldova's sovereign rights,116 or (ii) that the Moldovan courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the Suspension Decision.117 These arguments seem to go to the *exercise* of the Tribunal's power to grant provisional measures under the relevant legal standard (discussed below) and do not, as such, challenge that this power exists.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 48; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 24; Respondent's Observations, \u00b6 70.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 16.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 141, 194 *et seq.*\n\n*B. Legal Standard for Granting Preliminary Measures*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nArticle 46(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules does not provide any guidance as to how arbitral tribunals should exercise their discretion in granting provisional measures. Nonetheless, arbitral tribunals have over time distilled the conditions pursuant to which provisional measures may be granted. By way of example, in interpreting Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules and the related case law, the tribunal in *Anderson v. Costa Rica* emphasized that the two key factors that must be present to justify the granting of provisional measures are that \"*the measures must be necessary to preserve a party's rights*\" and that \"*the need for such measures must be urgent to avoid irreparable harm*.\"118\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson et al v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Decision on Provisional Measures, 5 November 2008, \u00b6 20 (**Exhibit CL-140**).\n\n123.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have cited to arbitral case law that applies Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and/or ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1). While these provisions do not apply to the case before the Tribunal, their wording is similar to the one in Article 46(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Parties that arbitral case law dealing with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and/or ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) may be considered in interpreting Article 46(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, unless there are established reasons requiring a distinction.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties are not fully aligned, but also not too far apart, as to the requirements for the granting of preliminary measures. The Claimants cite to *Sergei Paushok v. Mongolia*, where the Tribunal listed the following requirements: (i) \"prima facie *jurisdiction*,\" (ii) \"prima facie *establishment of the case*,\" (iii) \"*urgency*,\" (iv) \"*imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity)*,\" and (v) \"*proportionality*.\"119 The Respondent instead listed the following five requirements and emphasized that provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly: (i) \"*whether Rotalin has a right that requires preservation in the arbitration,*\" (ii) \"*there are circumstances of necessity to avoid irreparable harm being caused to Rotalin by Moldova against whom provisional measures are sought*,\" (iii) \"*there must be circumstances of urgency*,\" (iv) \"*the provisional measures requested must be proportional*,\" (v) \"*the provisional measures requested must not be too broad*,\" and (v) \"*any recommendation for the provisional measures must not prejudge the merits of the case*.\"120\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Co. and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Co. v. Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 45 (**Exhibit CL-139**); Claimants' Request, \u00b6 49.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 72, 84.\n\n125.\n\nThus, the key differences in the Parties' suggested legal standards relate to (i) whether the Tribunal ought to assess jurisdiction and the merits of the case on a *prima facie* basis, (ii) whether the threshold for necessity is one of \"*serious prejudice*\" or \"*irreparable harm*,\" and (iii) whether there is an additional condition that the measures cannot be too broad.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by addressing the first point concerning the *prima facie* threshold for establishing jurisdiction and the merits of the case. While the Respondent argues that \"*the requirement that the tribunal have* prima facie *jurisdiction is biased and self-sustaining,*\"121 the Respondent provides no case law support for its argument. The Tribunal notes that arbitral tribunals have regularly tested jurisdiction and merits on a *prima facie* basis only.122 It is an inevitable and inherent consequence of the fact that provisional measures are typically requested in advance of a tribunal's decision on jurisdiction and/or merits. Therefore, tribunals are simply not in a position (and indeed it would be inappropriate for them) to make a final decision on these issues.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 104.\n\nSee, e.g. *Alasdair Ross Anderson et al v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Decision on Provisional Measures,5 November 2008, \u00b6 15 (\"The requirement of priority means that in order to avoid harm to rights that are at risk, the Tribunal, once having heard the arguments of the parties, should proceed to decide on the request for provisional measures before making any other decision, even those decisions relating to jurisdiction, a position taken by many ICSID tribunals.\") (**Exhibit CL-140**).\n\n127.\n\nTurning now to the second point concerning the \"*serious prejudice*\" or \"*irreparable harm*\" standards, the Tribunal notes that a discussion in the abstract on these terms might seem like a question of semantics. More important, in the Tribunal's view, are the following considerations. On the one hand, it is clear that the threshold for granting preliminary measures is a high one.123 On the other hand, the mere fact that the damage can be redressed by monetary compensation is not sufficient in all cases to rule out provisional measures. As the tribunal in *Sergei Paushok v. Mongolia* observed, \"[t]*he possibility of monetary compensation does not necessarily eliminate the possible need for interim measures*.\"124\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Provisional Measures, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38 (\"Provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly.\") (**Exhibit RL-026**); *Nova Group Investments, B.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/19, Decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 227 (\"However, because this grant of authority is an exception to the general principle of State sovereignty, tribunals should exercise their discretion only within the strict confines of the power thus granted, namely as an exceptional remedy, reserved for exceptional circumstances.\") (**Exhibit RL-029**).\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Co. and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Co. v. Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 68 (**Exhibit CL-139**).\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the third point concerning the alleged requirement that the provisional measures may not be too broad. The Tribunal considers that this principle is already reflected in the factors of necessity, urgency, and proportionality. As the tribunal explained in *Nova v. Romania,*\n\n*\"*[i]*f the particular measure sought by the applicant is broader than required \u2026 to preserve the right in question, that portion of the measure will be neither necessary nor urgent, and almost by definition will impose burdens on the other party that are disproportionate to the claimed need.\"*125\n\n*Nova Group Investments, B.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/19, Decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 243 (**Exhibit RL-029**).\n\n129.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that in exercising its discretion to recommend provisional measures under Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal will consider the following criteria:\n\na. Whether the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to hear the Claimants' claims;\n\nb. Whether the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded;\n\nc. Whether the requested measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the Claimants' rights; and\n\nd. Whether the requested measures are proportionate.\n\n*C. Applying the Legal Standard to the Case at Hand*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1. *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal assesses in this section whether it has *prima facie* jurisdiction to hear the Claimants' claims.\n\n131.\n\n***First***, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to the Claimants' assertion, the screening by the ICSID Secretary General when registering the case is not sufficient to demonstrate *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims.126 As clarified by Article 5 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, when notifying the parties of the registration of a request, the Secretary-General \"*remind*[s] *the parties that the registration of the request is without prejudice to the powers and functions of the Arbitral Tribunal in regard to competence and merits*.\"127\n\n*See, e.g.* *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, \u00b6 39 (\"It is not enough for the Tribunal that the Secretary-General has found that the dispute is not manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and has therefore registered the Request for Arbitration under Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 6(1)(b) of the Institution Rules.\") (**Exhibit RL-028**).\n\nICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules (2006), Art. 5(d) (**Exhibit CL-002**); *see also* Screening of an Application for Access and of a Request, and Registration \u2013 Additional Facility Arbitration (2006) Rules (**Exhibit CL-142**).\n\n132.\n\n***Second***, the Tribunal has already found in its Decision on Bifurcation that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections were not *prima facie* serious.128 The Tribunal has not been presented with any new arguments or evidence, save an argument concerning the Suspension Decision on 21 October 2023. The Respondent argues that in submitting detailed briefs to the Moldovan courts, the Claimants have triggered the fork-in-the-road provision of the ECT and that accordingly the issue of the legality of the Suspension Decision is not for this Tribunal to decide.129 The Respondent further argues that the proceedings before the Court dealt with the merits of the Suspension Decision and not merely with procedural aspects.130 Finally, the Respondent emphasizes that the Court's decision has not yet become binding as the Claimants have the option to appeal it.131 The Claimants, to the contrary, assert that the Court limited its review to fundamental procedural errors and did not concern itself with the material validity of the Suspension Decision.132\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, Decision on Bifurcation, 11 October 2023, \u00b6 43.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 87 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 96; *see also* Second Witness Statement of Mihai Murgulet, 30 October 2023, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 97 *et seq.*\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 20.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal is not in a position to assess the scope of the Court's decision to uphold the validity of the Suspension Decision. The decision on the record is only the unreasoned dispositive version of the Court's decision.133 The reasoned decision is yet to be published. As a result, the Tribunal cannot assess with certainty at this stage whether the underlying proceedings concerned the merits of the Suspension Decision (as the Respondent argues) or only procedural matters (as the Claimants argue).\n\nJudgment of the Chisinau District Court, Docket No. 2c-2555/23, 21 October 2023, (**Exhibit C-313**); Second Witness Statement of Mihai Murgulet, 30 October 2023, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n\n134.\n\nHowever, even if the Court's decision did concern the merits of the Suspension Decision, the Tribunal is *prima facie* not convinced that this would trigger the fork-in-the road provision in the ECT. Article 26(2) of the ECT provides that:\n\n*\"If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to the dispute;*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\"*134\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, Art. 26(2) (**Exhibit CL-001**).\n\n135.\n\nNotably, Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT goes on to provide that:\n\n*\"Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\"*135\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, Art. 26(3)(a) (**Exhibit CL-001**).\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal *prima facie* does not consider that this fork-in-the road provision could have been triggered by the Court's decision concerning the Suspension Decision, even if the Court had dealt with issues of material validity. This is because the application to the Court was filed by ANRE's legal department,136 and the Claimants only filed a defence.137 This is different from the Claimants actively choosing the Moldovan courts as their forum of choice under Article 26 of the ECT and thereby arguably triggering the fork-in-the road provision. In reaching this decision, the Tribunal has not made any finding as to whether the fork-in-the road provision in Article 26 of the ECT would apply to the case at hand otherwise.\n\nRespondent's Observations, \u00b6 63; Second Witness Statement of Mihai Murgulet, 30 October 2023, \u00b6 13; ANRE's Request for the Suspension of Supply License (**Exhibit MM-018**).\n\nRotalin's Statement of Defence before Chisinau District Court (**Exhibit MM-023-1**).\n\n137.\n\nIn sum, therefore, the Tribunal finds that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims. In doing so, the Tribunal does not in any way prejudge any issues of fact or law which may be raised by the Parties during these proceedings concerning the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the Claimants' claims.\n\n2. *Prima Facie* Merits\n-----------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal assesses in this section whether the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded.\n\n139.\n\nTribunals have made clear that the standard for the *prima facie* establishment of the merits of the case is a low one. As the tribunal in *Pushok v. Mongolia* explained,\n\n*\"*[e]*ssentially, the Tribunal needs to decide only that the claims made are not, on their face, frivolous \u2026 To do otherwise would require the Tribunal to proceed to a determination of the facts and, in practice, to a hearing on the merits of the case, a lengthy and complicated process which would defeat the very purpose of interim measures.\"*138\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Co. and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Co. v. Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 55 (**Exhibit CL-139**).\n\n140.\n\nTribunals have often relied on the test established by the International Court of Justice in the *Oil Platforms* case,139 specifically Judge Higgins' formulation in her Separate Opinion that the court ought to \"*accept* pro tem *the facts as alleged by* [the Applicant] *to be true*\"140 and assess on that basis whether there is a possibility of breach. As explained by Judge Higgins:\n\n*\"The Court should \u2026 see if, on the facts as alleged by* [the Applicant]*, the* [Respondent's] *actions complained of might violate the Treaty articles \u2026 Nothing in this approach puts at risk the obligation of the Court to keep separate the jurisdictional and merits phases \u2026 and to protect the integrity of the proceedings on the merits \u2026 what is for the merits \u2026 is to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of \u2026* [the treaty] *and if so, whether there is a defense to that violation \u2026 In short it is at the merits that one sees 'whether there really has been a breach.'\"*141\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 129-131 (**Exhibit CL-143**); *David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v. Republic of Poland,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/10/1, Award, 16 May 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 143-145 (**Exhibit CL-144**).\n\n*Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* Judgment, 6 November 2023, Separate Opinion by Judge Higgins, p. 856 (**Exhibit CL-145**).\n\n*Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),* Judgment, 6 November 2023, Separate Opinion by Judge Higgins, pp. 856-857 (**Exhibit CL-145**).\n\n141.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Parties' respective submissions presented to date, the Tribunal finds that nothing indicates, at this stage, that the Claimants' claims are on their face, frivolous. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded. In doing so, the Tribunal does not in any way prejudge any issues of fact or law which may be raised by the Parties during these proceedings concerning the merits of the Claimants' claims.\n\n3. Necessity\n------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal assesses in this section whether the requested measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the Claimants' rights.142\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, \u00b6 59 (**Exhibit RL-030**); *Plama Consortium Ltd v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38 (**Exhibit RL-026**).\n\n143.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal must establish which rights the Claimants are seeking to protect from irreparable harm through the requested measures. The Tribunal notes that the rights for which the Claimants seek protection are not the ones that form the basis of the Claimants' claims on the merits. The Claimants describe their claims on the merits as follows:\n\n*\"Claimants' main claim in these proceedings is the claim for recovery of their holistic investment costs ('**Underrecovery Claim**'). As Rotalin invested into new gas networks in Moldova, according to basic regulatory principles it should have been allowed to recover the costs of these investments through tariffs. But this never happened. In addition, Claimants claim damages from Moldova's failure to open the market despite the repeated promises ('**TPA Claim**').\"*143\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 10.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"[w]*hile the request for provisional measures is connected to the arbitration in the sense that it seeks to prevent the aggravation of the dispute and interference with it, it is different from the Claimants' claims as pleaded in the Memorial on the Merits*.\"144 The rights the Claimants seek to protect by way of provisional measures were listed by the Claimants as follows: (i) \"*the right to maintain the* status quo ante*,*\" (ii) \"*the non-aggravation of the dispute*,\" (iii) \"*the right to be treated fairly and equitably and not to be unlawfully expropriated*,\" (iv) \"*the right to preserve the integrity of the proceedings and equality of arms*,\" (v) and the \"*Claimants' right to be heard*.\"145\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 46.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 43; *see also* Claimants' Request, \u00b6 59.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that strict identity between the object of the requested provisional measures and the rights in dispute is not required. As the Tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia* explained,\n\n*\"the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are not limited to those which form the subject matter of the dispute, but may extend to procedural rights, including the general right to the preservation of the status quo and to the non-aggravation of the dispute.\"*146\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 117 (**Exhibit RL-032**).\n\n146.\n\nThese are self-standing rights, as recognized by the tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador*.147\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)*, ICSID Case No. Arb/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 60 (**Exhibit RL-040**).\n\n147.\n\nThere must, however, be a link between the requested provisional measures and the underlying dispute.148 As the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* explained:\n\n*\"The rights to be preserved must relate to the requesting party's ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be carried out. Thus the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party's claims and requests for relief. They may be general rights, such as the rights to due process or the right not to have the dispute aggravated, but those general rights must be related to the specific disputes in arbitration, which, in turn, are defined by the Claimant's claims and requests for relief to date.\"*149\n\n*See, e.g.* *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 118 (\"In the Tribunal's view, the applicable criterion is that \"the right to be preserved bears a relation with the dispute.\") (**Exhibit RL-032**); *see also* *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2,28 October 1999, \u00b6 23 (\"Any preliminary measure to be ordered by an ICSID arbitral tribunal must relate to the subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous matters\") (**Exhibit RL-033**).\n\n*Plama Consortium Ltd v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40 (**Exhibit RL-026**).\n\n148.\n\nIn the present case, some of the rights the Claimants seek to protect by the requested provisional measures are sufficiently linked to the underlying dispute, such as the general right to maintain the *status quo ante* or to avoid the non-aggravation of the dispute. However, the Claimants also argue that the provisional measures are required so as \"*to be treated fairly and equitably and not to be unlawfully expropriated*.\" The Claimants' argument assumes that there would be a (further) breach of the FET and expropriation standards in the ECT if Rotalin were to definitively lose its supply license.150 These, however, are claims and requests for relief that the Claimants have not yet formulated as of today.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 64; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 43.\n\n149.\n\nIn any event, as a second step, the Tribunal must also consider whether there is a risk of irreparable harm in relation to the rights that the Claimants seek to protect. The Claimants' core argument is that the requested provisional measures are necessary because otherwise (i) the Claimants will be in financial duress and thus unable to proceed with the arbitration,151 and (ii) there is a risk of further treaty breaches (notably, breaches of the FET and expropriation standards in the ECT)152 if Rotalin were to definitively lose its supply license. The Tribunal will address both arguments in turn.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 70; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 52, 77.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 64; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 43.\n\nFinancial Duress and Inability to Proceed with the Arbitration\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nWhile the Claimants allege their financial precarity threatening an inability to continue with the arbitration, they have not provided any evidence to this effect, much less compelling evidence. In the absence of such evidence, the picture emerging from the record is mixed.\n\n151.\n\nOn the one hand, some of the submissions and documents on record seem to suggest that in recent times Rotalin has been able to operate at a profit, at least during a certain period of time.153 The Claimants argue (without providing evidence) that this profit has been used to repay past debts to ModovaGaz.154\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 35; Letter No. 06-01/4012 from ANRE to Rotalin, 28 September 2023, (**Exhibit C-305**); *see also* Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 48-54.\n\nClaimant's Request, \u00b6 38.\n\n152.\n\nOn the other hand, Rotalin has stressed in correspondence with the Emergency Commission of the Moldovan Government and ANRE that it was under \"*current working capital constraints*.\"155\n\nLetter No. 1258 from Rotalin to Emergency Commission and ANRE, 8 September 2023, (**Exhibit C-301**); *see also* Claimants' Request, \u00b6 38; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 15.\n\n153.\n\nHowever, and in any event, even if Rotalin and/or the Claimants are in fact facing financial constraints, the Claimants have not established that this would lead to an inability to proceed with the present arbitration. The Tribunal notes that claimants, even in financially precarious situations, generally have means to proceed with legal proceedings and it is not for this Tribunal to assess the Claimants' options and strategic choices.\n\nLoss of the Supply License\n--------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that the loss of Rotalin's supply license could, in certain circumstances, be seen as irreparable harm, because in such a scenario (as the Claimant argues and the Respondent does not contest) Rotalin would definitively lose its client base.156\n\n*See* Claimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 71.\n\n155.\n\nHowever, the potential loss of the supply license in this case is, in the first instance, a consequence of the Claimants' affirmative decision to stop supplying gas to consumer households as from 1 October 2023. The Claimants and other gas suppliers have an obligation to supply gas to consumer households at regulated prices (the so-called PSO).157 The Claimants were aware of this obligation. By way of example, in the 8 September 2023 correspondence to the Emergency Commission of the Moldovan Government and ANRE, the Claimants \"*acknowledge the imperative of maintaining an uninterrupted gas supply to the population and are prepared to comply with the new tariffs for as long as possible*.\"158\n\nANRE Decision No. 287, 17 November 2016 (**Exhibit MM-003**); ANRE Decision No. 487, 20 December 2019 (**Exhibit C-279**).\n\nLetter No. 1258 from Rotalin to Emergency Commission and ANRE, 8 September 2023 (**Exhibit C-301**).\n\n156.\n\nThe Claimants argue that notwithstanding this statement, they subsequently had no choice but to stop the supply of gas, because (i) Decision No. 523 concerning the Claimants' tariffs was incorrect and resulted in supply prices that were too low, and that (ii) as a consequence, it was \"*impossible*\" for the Claimants to continue supplying159 gas.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 28-39; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 33, 43.\n\n157.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has not been presented with compelling evidence for either prong of the Claimants' argument.\n\na. With regards to the first prong, the Claimants have not sufficiently substantiated to what extent ANRE's tariff determination in Decision No. 523 was wrong, other than alleging that it should have taken into account historical losses. The Claimants merely argue that the price is too low and would not allow them to supply gas profitably.160 In doing so, the Claimants acknowledge that ANRE applied its methodology, even if the Claimants consider that methodology to be affected by \"*shortcomings*.\"161\n\nb. With regards to the second prong, even if one were to accept the Claimants' argument that the tariffs are so low that they would not allow the Claimants to supply gas *profitably*, the Claimants have not presented any compelling evidence of why this rendered its supply of gas *impossible*. ANRE's tariff decision is, in principle, only valid for a limited period of time,162 and suffering losses for a limited period of time does not render the supply impossible. The Claimants assert that continuing to supply gas would mean having to \"*cross-subsidize its supply operations via revenues earned by its redistribution operation, thereby risking the safety of both operations*.\"163 Again, the Tribunal considers that no compelling evidence has been presented on what these alleged safety risks would entail.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 28-33; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 72.\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6 35 (\"ANRE applies an isolated observation period to fabricate an alleged overrecovery: ANRE arrived at the insufficient tariff by conveniently taking advantage of the shortcomings of the tariff methodology that ANRE itself created.\").\n\nThe Tribunal understands that license holders submit requests regarding regulated tariffs on an annual basis, by 1 February of each year. *See* Claimants' Request, \u00b6 17; ANRE Decision No. 286 Regarding the Approval of the Regulation on the Procedures for the Presentation and Examination of License Holders' Applications Regarding Regulated Prices and Tariffs, 17 October 2018, Section 1(3)(b), Section 2(5)(2)(a) (**Exhibit C-240**).\n\nClaimants' Request, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 43, 65.\n\n158.\n\nIn sum, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants have not demonstrated that the requested measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the Claimants' rights.\n\n159.\n\nIn light of its finding, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to address the other requirements for provisional measures.\n\n160.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that its conclusion is unaffected by the Claimants' Request for Reconsideration. The Tribunal notes that during the meeting of 17 November 2023, ANRE postponed its decision on whether to impose a fine on Rotalin because of Rotalin's decision to stop supplying gas under the PSO.164 The mere fact that a press release that mistakenly stated otherwise was issued165 is, in the Tribunal's view, not materially relevant to the Tribunal's assessment as outlined above. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to assess, as requested by the Respondent, whether the Claimants' Request for Reconsideration was \"*an improper procedural submission*.\"166\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, p. 1; Witness Statement of Natalia Baiesu, 21 November 2023, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, p. 1; Respondent's Objection, pp. 2, 4; Witness Statement of Natalia Baiesu, 21 November 2023, \u00b6\u00b6 30 \u2013 31.\n\nRespondent's Objection, p. 5.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n161.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. Dismisses the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures;\n\nb. Dismisses the Claimants' Request for Reconsideration; and\n\nc. Reserves its decision on costs arising out of the Claimants' Request for\n\nProvisional Measures and the Claimants' Request for Reconsideration.\n\nDate: 11 December 2023"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Second Request for Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2024-07-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Second Request for Provisional Measures)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Procedural Order No. 6 addresses the Claimants' Second Request for Provisional Measures dated 11 June 2024 (\"**Claimants' Second Request**\").1\n\nCapitalized terms, unless defined otherwise herein, shall have the meaning as defined in prior procedural orders.\n\n2.\n\nOn 5 October 2023, followed by subsequent comments on 23 October 2023, the Claimants made a first request for provisional measures (\"**Claimants' First Request**\") seeking various directions against the Respondent in relation to ANRE's suspension of the gas supply license belonging to Rotalin Gaz Trading S.R.L (\"**Rotalin**\"). On 16 and 30 October 2023, the Respondent submitted its comments to the Claimants' First Request.\n\n3.\n\nOn 17 November 2023, after carefully considering the Parties' respective submissions, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to dismiss the Claimants' First Request. Later, on 11 December 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, setting out the reasons for its decision to dismiss the Claimants' First Request.\n\n4.\n\nOn 11 June 2024, the Claimants filed the Claimants' Second Request along with exhibits C-318 to C-347 and legal authorities CL-157 to CL-160. As further detailed below, the Claimants' Second Request relates to a fine levied by ANRE Decision No. 342 dated 4 June 2024 (\"**Decision No. 342**\").\n\n5.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Claimants' Second Request on 12 June 2024, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide observations on the Claimants' Second Request.\n\n6.\n\nAlso on 12 June 2024, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that their request to the Respondent to extend the deadline for payment of the fine levied by Decision No. 342 had been denied and that the full payment of the fine was due on the next day, 13 June 2024. For that reason, the Claimants requested the urgent grant of the Second Request and sought that the Tribunal order the Respondent not to take any steps to enforce the fine levied on Rotalin by Decision No. 342.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 June 2024, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Claimants' Second Request, along with a third witness statement of Mr. Mihai Murgulet, exhibits MM-026 to MM-037, and legal authorities RL-187 to RL-190. Among other things, the Respondent took issue with the Claimants' assertion about urgency, stating that \"*Rotalin has 30 days to pay the fine*.\"2\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 167.\n\n8.\n\nOn 17 June 2024, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to \"*refrain from taking any steps in relation to matters which are the subject of the Second Request*\" while it considered the Parties' submissions on the Claimants' Second Request. The Tribunal noted that, in making this direction, it had taken into account the Respondent's statement (as above) about Rotalin still having some time to pay the fine.\n\n9.\n\nA brief overview of the relevant facts is set out in Section II of this Procedural Order. After summarizing the Parties' positions in Section III of this Procedural Order, the Tribunal provides the reasons for its decision in Section IV. The Tribunal's decision is set out in Section V.\n\n**II. RELEVANT FACTS**\n----------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal provides an illustrative summary of facts upon which the Second Request for Provisional Measures is based. The summary does not constitute any finding by the Tribunal on any facts disputed by the Parties. A more detailed analysis of the facts relevant to the Tribunal's decision on the Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures is contained in Section IV.\n\n*A. Public Service Obligations under the Law on Natural Gas*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nSince 2016, Rotalin has been under an obligation to supply gas at regulated prices within its distribution area under the so-called Public Service Obligation (\"**PSO**\"). It was obliged under various provisions of Moldova's Law on Natural Gas No. 108/2016 (\"**Law on Natural Gas**\") to supply continuous and uninterrupted natural gas to its customers.3\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 32.\n\n12.\n\nOn 20 December 2019, via ANRE Decision No. 487/2019, the Respondent amended the previously existing PSO upon all suppliers who operate in a regulated tariff market (\"**Decision No. 487**\") and imposed \"*for a term of 7 years, the [PSO] to supply natural gas to final consumers at established quality parameters, at regulated, transparent, non-discriminatory and easily comparable prices, on license holders for the supply of natural gas, within the limits of the territories authorized by licenses of the distribution system operators\u2026*\"4 ANRE consulted with Rotalin prior to Decision No. 487's approval, and Rotalin did not contest its adoption.5\n\nDecision No. 487, 20 December 2019 (**Exhibit C-279**); Respondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 33.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 34.\n\n*B. Moldova's Adoption of Third-Party Access*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn late 2022, ANRE implemented third-party access to the Moldovan gas market. This allowed Rotalin to import cheaper gas from outside Moldova and had, according to the Claimants, resulted in \"*(temporary) positive effects*\" on Rotalin's supply operations.6\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 13,15.\n\n*C. Rotalin's End-User Tariff Application*\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn July 2023, Rotalin applied for an individual end-user tariff.7 In assessing this application, ANRE took note of Rotalin's declared profits and calculated that Rotalin obtained a tariff surplus of MDL 38,453,860.8\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 35.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 36 \u2013 37.\n\n*D. ANRE Decision Nos. 522 and 523*\n-----------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 September 2023, ANRE issued two decisions: (i) Decision No. 522/2023 on the adjustment of regulated tariffs for the natural gas distribution service (\"**Decision No. 522**\"),9 and (ii) Decision No. 523/2023 on the approval of regulated prices for the supply of natural gas by Rotalin (\"**Decision No. 523**\").10\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 38.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 13.\n\n16.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in issuing Decision No. 523, ANRE misused the applicable tariff methodology to \"*isolate the first few months of profitable operations*\" following the introduction of the third-party access in the Moldovan gas market by ANRE.11 This, the Claimants allege, resulted in \"*an unrealistically low tariff*\" which eventually \"*led to Rotalin's inability to continue its supply operations beyond 1 October 2023 and suspension of its supply license*.\"12\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 13,15.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 15.\n\n*E. Requests to be Released from PSO and Supply Disruption*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nBetween 8 September 2023 and 3 October 2023, Rotalin made several requests to ANRE to release it from the PSO.13 However, ANRE did not accept any of its requests.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 16; Letter No. 1258 from Rotalin to Emergency Commission and ANRE, 8 September 2023 (**Exhibit C-301**); Letter No. 1270 from Rotalin to ANRE, 13 September 2023 (**Exhibit C-302**); Letter No. 06-01/4012 from ANRE to Rotalin, 28 September 2023 (**Exhibit C-305**); Letter No. 04-01/4087 of 3 October 2023 from ANRE to Rotalin (**Exhibit C-300**).\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 September 2023, Rotalin wrote to ANRE indicating its intention to terminate its supply of natural gas to its end-users.14 In response, on 26 September 2023, ANRE issued Prescription No. 000451, requiring Rotalin to supply natural gas to its end-users.15 Two days later, on 28 September 2023, ANRE issued Prescription No. 000452, reiterating its previous direction.16\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 40.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 41.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 42.\n\n19.\n\nSubsequently, from around 2 October 2023, Rotalin stopped supplying natural gas to its end-users.17\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 43; Third Witness Statement of Mihai Murgulet, \u00b6 25.\n\n*F. ANRE's Suspension Decision and Subsequent Court Proceedings*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAs a consequence of Rotalin's failure to supply gas under the PSO, on 2 October 2023, ANRE suspended Rotalin's supply license (\"**Suspension Decision**\"). ANRE directed Rotalin to resume supply of natural gas within three months. If Rotalin failed to recommence supply within three months, it could face a permanent revocation of its supply license.18\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 45.\n\n21.\n\nOn 4 October 2023, ANRE commenced proceedings before the Chisinau District Court (\"**Court**\") seeking a ruling on the validity of the Suspension Decision.19 Rotalin participated in the proceedings. It sought and secured a stay of the Suspension Decision.20\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 46.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 47- 48.\n\n22.\n\nOn 20 October 2023, the Court found that the Suspension Decision was valid.21 Rotalin filed an appeal, which remains pending, as far as the Tribunal is aware.22\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 50; Decision of Chisinau Court of Justice dated 20 October 2023 (**Exhibit MM-24**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 51; Third Witness Statement of Mihai Murgulet, \u00b6 37.\n\n*G. ANRE's Decision to Postpone Imposing a Fine on Rotalin*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nAs noted in Procedural Order No. 3, on 17 November 2023, ANRE held a meeting and decided to postpone imposing a fine on Rotalin for failing to supply gas under the PSO.23 Nonetheless, on the same day, ANRE published a press release on its website stating that Rotalin was fined MDL 12,057,134.40, i.e., roughly an amount corresponding to 5% of Rotalin's annual turnover (\"**Announced Fine**\").24 The press release was removed from ANRE's website within minutes of its posting.25\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimants' Request for Reconsideration, p. 1; Respondent's Objection, pp. 2, 4; Witness Statement of Natalia Baiesu, 21 November 2023, \u00b6\u00b6 30 \u2013 31.\n\nRespondent's Objection, pp. 2, 4.\n\n*H. Rotalin's Request to Revoke the PSO*\n----------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 20 November 2023, Rotalin submitted a formal request to ANRE seeking to revoke its PSO.26\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 16.\n\n25.\n\nOn 20 December 2023, ANRE denied Rotalin's request.27\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 16.\n\n*I. Entry Into Force of Law No. 429*\n------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 December 2023, the Respondent adopted Law No. 429, which came into force on 29 December 2023 (\"**Law No. 429**\"). Under this law, it became mandatory for ANRE to impose a fine on \"*license holders, but not less than 500 000 lei, or at least 5% of the turnover of authorization holders for breach of obligations*\" in case of \"*non-execution by the license holders of the public service obligations imposed in accordance with provisions of art. 11, art. 89 and art. 90 or refusal to honor their public service obligations.*\"28\n\nLaw No. 429, Article 427 amending Article 113(2)(g) of the 2016 Gas Law, p. 28 (**Exhibit C-335**).\n\n*J. ANRE's Revocation Decision*\n-------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nDespite its previous 20 December 2023 denial, on 30 January 2024, ANRE indicated its intention to revoke Rotalin's PSO from 1 February 2024 (\"**Decision No. 44**\"). Moreover, ANRE decided that (i) an amount of MDL 38,453,860 was the accumulated surplus of the PSO obligation between 1 January and 2 October 2023 \"*to be recovered to system users from the territory served by*\" Rotalin; and (ii) ANRE's legal department would initiate a procedure to fine Rotalin under the Law on Natural Gas.29\n\nANRE Decision No. 44, 30 January 2024, p. 2 (**Exhibit C-322**).\n\n28.\n\nShortly thereafter, on 2 February 2024, ANRE issued two decisions.\n\na. ANRE decided to revoke Rotalin's PSO (\"**Decision No. 45**\" or \"**Revocation Decision**\"). According to the Respondent, the Revocation Decision prohibited Rotalin from supplying natural gas in the regulated market but did not affect Rotalin's ability to supply natural gas to the unregulated market.30\n\nb. ANRE also directed Rotalin to pay MDL 12.8 million in each of 2024, 2025, and 2026 to cover the tariff surplus (\"**Decision No. 46**\").31\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 56 - 57.\n\nDecision No. 46, 2 February 2024 (**Exhibit C-332**).\n\n*K. ANRE's Calculation of Rotalin's Tariff Surplus and Computation of Fine*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nSubsequently, on 27 March 2024, ANRE repealed Decision No. 46 (\"**Decision No. 211**\")32 and instead calculated Rotalin's tariff surplus to be MDL 38,353,860.33 ANRE also amended Decision No. 44, by deleting the portion of that decision which had directed that the tariff surplus be recovered from the territory served by Rotalin in its capacity as a distribution system operator.34\n\nANRE Decision No. 211, 27 March 2024 (**Exhibit C-334**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 61.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 21, Decision No. 211, 27 March 2024 (**Exhibit C-334**).\n\n30.\n\nOn 10 April 2024, ANRE informed Rotalin that it had initiated procedures to apply a fine on Rotalin based on its declared revenue, as recorded in an information note dated 14 May 2024 issued by the Department of Natural Gas and Heat Energy.35 The information note recorded Rotalin's turnover for the period 1 January to 2 October 2023 to be MDL 225,021,000. Accordingly, ANRE assessed the fine to be MDL 38,453,8636 which was 17.8% of Rotalin's turnover.37\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 62.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 63.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, fn 3. The Claimants submit that based on Rotalin's total turnover of approximately MDL 205 million in 2023, the actual percentage of the fine amount is higher than 17.8% as stated by ANRE.\n\n*L. ANRE's Imposition of the Fine*\n----------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn 28 May 2024, ANRE held a meeting and announced its intention to impose a fine of MDL 38,453,860 on Rotalin for breach of the PSO.38 Rotalin's administrator, Mr. Ihor Mankovskyi, participated in the meeting and submitted documents contesting the fine announced by ANRE.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 19.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, at the time, Rotalin had a cash balance of MDL 13.2 million, which would enable Rotalin to pay the [A]*nnounced* [F]*ine of ca MDL 12 million which ANRE intended to impose in November 2023.*\"39 As noted above, the Announced Fine had referred to calculations at 5% of Rotalin's annual turnover.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 26.\n\n*M. ANRE Decision No. 342*\n--------------------------\n\n33.\n\nOn 4 June 2024, ANRE issued Decision No. 342, imposing a fine of MDL 38,453,860 on Rotalin on the ground that it had breached the PSO.40\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 24; Respondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 66; ANRE Decision No. 342, 4 June 2024 (**Exhibit C-318).**\n\n34.\n\nRotalin was served this decision on 10 June 2024.41\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 1.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants submit that under Article 20(1) of Moldova's Law No. 174/2021 regarding energy (\"**Law on Energy**\"), Rotalin was required to pay the fine levied under Decision No. 342 within 72 hours of service, i.e., by 3:30 pm local time on 13 June 2024.42 The Respondent submits that \"*there is no 72 hour period obliging Rotalin to pay*,\" and instead it was a \"*benefit*\" available to Rotalin who could avoid paying 50% of the fine if it paid the remaining 50% within a 72-hour period.43\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 2.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 26 \u2013 27.\n\n*N. Rotalin's Requests for Extension of Time to Pay the Fine*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nOn 11 June 2024, Rotalin sought an extension of the 72-hour time period set out in Article 20 of the Law on Energy44.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, fn 5.\n\n37.\n\nOn 12 June 2024, ANRE denied Rotalin's request for extension dated 11 June 2024, noting that the \"*amendment of the 72-hour term from* [the Law on Energy] *can only be carried out by the Parliament by adopting an amending law*.\"45\n\nANRE's letter no. 06-01/2838 to Rotalin, 12 June 2024 (**Exhibit C-348**).\n\n**III. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n*A. Claimants' Position*\n------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to:\n\n*\"(i) Order Respondent to prevent the seizure of Rotalin's assets, bank accounts and other property in Moldova as a result of enforcement of (i) the Decision No. 342 of 4 June 2024, imposing a fine of MDL 38.5 million against Rotalin, and (ii) Decision No. 44 of 30 January 2024, as amended by Decision No. 211 of 27 March 2024, finding the alleged surplus of MDL 38.5 million.*\n\n*(ii) Order Respondent to compensate Claimants for their costs arising out of the provisional measure request in an amount to be specified later, together with interest thereon.*\n\n*(iii) Order any other alternative provisional measures that the Arbitral Tribunal may deem more appropriate*.\"46\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 64.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Rotalin does not have the capacity to even pay 50% of the MDL 38.5 million fine to ANRE within the 72-hour period set out in the Law on Energy. The Claimants argue that given the distribution tariff of MDL 53.3 million, and planned operating expenses of MDL 51.6 million, there would be a deficit of MDL 36.7 million.47 The Claimants estimate that it will take Rotalin more than six years of operating at zero profit to pay the fine.48\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 24.\n\n40.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimants submit that the Respondents' demand for the payment of MDL 38.5 million as a fine (pursuant to Decision Nos. 342 and 44) creates an imminent risk of seizure of all of Rotalin's assets and property. The Claimants argue that such a seizure would threaten the integrity of the present arbitral proceedings and the Claimants' procedural rights.49\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 29.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants assert that while Rotalin intends to challenge the fine before Moldovan courts, that challenge will have no suspensive effect and will not prevent \"*an immediate seizure of its assets and ultimately the transfer to Moldovagaz*.\"50\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 45, 2.\n\n42.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants characterise the fine levied by ANRE as being \"*disproportionate and excessive*.\"51\n\na. The Claimants submit that \u2013 to their knowledge \u2013 this is the \"*largest regulatory fine ever imposed in Moldova*\" and that the \"*abusive*\" fine is intended to eliminate Rotalin from the market.52 The Claimants argue that \"*hardly any company active in the international gas business*\" would be able to survive a fine of the magnitude levied by ANRE.53\n\nb. They argue, referring to competition law as an example, that \"*[u]sually in case of fines based on turnover, the upper end of fines is capped at 10% of the turnover*,\" and even the 10% fine is reserved for \"the most serious and continuous breaches.\"54 In contrast, the Claimants argue, Rotalin has been penalized for nearly double the upper limit of 10% for a \"single instance of an alleged breach of the PSO.\"55\n\nc. Asserting that \"[r]*egulatory fines shall never force a regulatory undertaking into an insolvency*,\" the Claimants argue that ANRE is causing harm by reducing the number of regulated entities in the market and that the fine \"*squarely contradicts basic regulatory principles*.\"56\n\nd. The Claimants further argue that it is uncertain whether ANRE still intends to recover the alleged surplus of around MDL 38.5 million in addition to the fine it has already imposed. Characterising any such demand as \"*double punishment*,\" the Claimants argue that \"*the lack of transparency and obvious correlation of the amounts are telling of the true intentions behind the fine*.\"57\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 5.\n\n1. Power to Order Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants rely on Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules (2006), which provides as follows:\n\n\"*(1) Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such a request*.\"58\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 31.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants assert that there is nothing in the ECT which precludes the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion or competence to order provisional measures in these proceedings.59\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 31.\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants identify the following conditions for an order of provisional measures:60\n\na. whether the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to hear the Claimants;\n\nb. whether the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded;\n\nc. whether the requested measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the Claimants' rights; and\n\nd. whether the requested measures are proportionate.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 33, citing R\u00e9gis Bismuth, 'Anatomy of the Law and Practice of Interim Protective Measures in International Investment Arbitration', Journal of International Arbitration, (Kluwer Law International; Kluwer Law International 2009, Volume 26 Issue 6), p. 814 (wfr) (**Exhibit CL-141**).\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submit that these conditions have been met in this case.61 The Claimants also submit that the rights they seek to protect by the requested measures are procedural rights, namely \"*the right to be heard, the right to a fair proceeding and the protection of the integrity of the arbitration as a whole by preventing Respondent from expropriating Claimants, pushing Rotalin into insolvency and seizing all its assets and property*,\"62 and the requested measure would \"*maintain the status quo of the arbitration*.\"63\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 34.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 41.\n\n2. Jurisdiction and Merits\n--------------------------\n\n47.\n\nArguing that the threshold to demonstrate *prima facie* jurisdiction is low, the Claimants contend that such *prima facie* jurisdiction exists. They argue that the existence of a relevant treaty or arbitration agreement is enough to establish *prima facie* jurisdiction. They further assert that the low threshold to establish *prima facie* jurisdiction has been met because in registering the proceedings, the ICSID Secretariat carried out a \"*basic review of the jurisdictional requirements*.\"64 The Claimants note further that the Tribunal has already found, in Procedural Order No. 3, that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction.65\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 36 referring to Procedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 138.\n\n48.\n\nFurther, the Claimants submit that they have a *prima facie* case on the merits, as the Tribunal confirmed in Procedural Order No. 3, where it stated that \"*the Claimants' claims are* prima facie *well-founded*.\"66\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 35.\n\n3. Necessity\n------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"the requested provisional measures are necessary to preserve this arbitration\" to \"prevent further aggravating of the dispute and protect Claimants' right to be heard.\"67 Relying on *Gabriel Resources v. Romania*, the Claimants argue that \"the rights to be protected may include a party's right to the procedural integrity of the arbitration.\"68\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 38.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 39; *Gabriel Resources Ltd. and Gabriel Resources (Jersey) v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/31, Decision on Claimants Second Request for Provisional Measures, 22 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 69 \u2013 70 (**Exhibit CL-146**).\n\n50.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants argue that the provisional measures requested are necessary to maintain the status quo of this arbitration and prevent the aggravation of the dispute.69 The Claimants rely on the observations of the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3 that \"*the rights Claimants seek to protect by the requested provisional measures are sufficiently linked to the underlying dispute, such as the general right to maintain the status quo ante or to avoid the non-aggravation of the dispute*.\"70\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 41.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 144, 148. Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 42.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants submit that any action against Rotalin to collect the alleged tariff surplus \"*would prevent* [Rotalin's] *continuation of operation on the distribution market.*\"71 The Claimants argue that the pertinent case law allows \"*specific performance requests for the preservation of the status quo*.\"72 According to the Claimants, \"[d]*ue to ANRE's actions Rotalin has already lost its whole supply business to Moldovagaz for good*\" and that \"*the enforcement of the fine* (*in isolation or together with the obligation to return the alleged 'surplus') effectively results in seizure of all Rotalin's assets and property and amounts to a hostile take-over of its distribution business*.\"73\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 45.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants submit that while Rotalin will challenge the fine, the challenge will not have a suspensive effect and will result \"*in an immediate seizure of its assets and ultimately the transfer to Moldovagaz*.\"74\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 45.\n\n53.\n\nRelatedly, the Claimants argue that Decision No. 342 threatens the integrity of the proceedings and the Claimants' right to be heard, since it will impede access to their revenue stream and will constrain their ability to successfully pursue this arbitration.75\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 47.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants dispute that the Respondent's actions were a consequence of the Claimants' decision to stop supplying gas to consumer households at regulated prices from 1 October 2023.76 Instead, the Claimants point out that (1) as on the date of the stoppage of supply, the amendments to the Law on Natural Gas, including the \"*fining provisions* had not come into existence; (2) Rotalin was prepared to pay (half of) the previously Announced Fine of approximately MDL 12 million; and (3) the alleged tariff \"*surplus*\" was imposed by the Respondent without any legal basis under the Respondent's 2020 Tariff Methodology.77\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 46.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 46.\n\n4. Urgency\n----------\n\n55.\n\nRegarding urgency, the Claimants submit that this requirement overlaps with necessity and the risk of harm discussed above, and that the Tribunal had also \"*not considered the requirement of urgency separately from necessity of the provisional measures*\" in Procedural Order No. 3.78\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 51.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants nonetheless set out their case on the urgency of their request, and argue that urgency exists where the requesting party will likely \"*suffer imminent harm or at least harm that would arise before the award is rendered*.\"79 The Claimants argue that both risks exist in this case because (i) if the fines are imposed, Rotalin will be \"*pushed into insolvency*\" and \"*its assets and other property will inevitably be seized*\", and (ii) Rotalin does not have reserves, and since the distribution tariff \u2013 Rotalin's only revenue stream \u2013 is set at a low level, paying half of the fine is also unsustainable. For the Claimants, the \"*damage becomes irreparable*\" once Rotalin's bank accounts and assets are seized.80\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 52.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 53 \u2013 55.\n\n5. Proportionality\n------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants argue that when considering an application for provisional measures, the Tribunal has a duty to consider the harm sought to be prevented and balance it against the harm likely to be caused to the counterparty by the grant of the provisional measures.81 Relying on case law,82 the Claimants argue that provisional measures may be granted even in cases where this entails some interference with some aspects of the State's sovereign powers.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 56.\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 66 (**Exhibit CL-149**).\n\n58.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the requested measures are proportionate to the harm in the case at hand. On the one hand, the Claimants rely on the imminent threat of Rotalin's bankruptcy that would follow the enforcement of the fine or asset seizure. On the other hand, the Claimants argue that any restriction on Moldova's rights to enforce Decisions Nos. 342 and 44 would not put undue burden on the Respondent.83 According to the Claimants, Rotalin's gas distribution pipelines \"*cannot be used for any other purpose or transferred out of Moldova*.\"84 The Claimants argue that the measures requested \"*can be easily revoked and has no monetary, economic or other repercussions*\" and must therefore be proportional.85\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 59.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 60.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 61.\n\n*B. Respondent's Position*\n--------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants' Second Request.\n\n1. Provisional Measure Standards\n--------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent argues that provisional measures are exceptions to the general principle of State sovereignty and thus should be granted only extraordinarily.86 According to the Respondent, tribunals should exercise their discretion within strict confines and should recommend only the minimum steps necessary.87\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 67 \u2013 70.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 70.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent identifies the following five-prong test for the grant of interim measures:\n\na. *Prima facie* jurisdiction of the tribunal;\n\nb. *Prima facie* existence of a right susceptible of protection;\n\nc. Necessity of the measure requested;\n\nd. Urgency of the measure requested; and\n\ne. Proportionality of the measure requested.88\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 72.\n\n2. *Prima facie* Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal should issue interim orders only if a plausible source for asserting jurisdiction exists.89 The Respondent denies that that is the case here, and submits that although the Tribunal ruled in its Procedural Order No. 3 that it had *prima facie* jurisdiction, that ruling was before the Tribunal had the benefit of the Respondent's arguments on jurisdiction because it was before the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial.90\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 76.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 77 \u2013 78.\n\n63.\n\nRelying on case law, the Respondent argues that even though the mere fact that \"*a party contests the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to which the case is referred is insufficient to deprive that tribunal of the jurisdiction to order provisional measures*\"91 a tribunal cannot discard \"*elements which call into question the competence of the Tribunal*.\"92 The Respondent highlights that this is especially true as Rotalin is breaching Moldovan law, violating the ECT and asking the Tribunal for protection.93\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 79; *Victor Pey Casado and Fondation President Allende v. Republic of Chili*, ICSID Case no. ARB/98/2, Decision on provisional measures, 25 September 2001 \u00b6 7 (**Exhibit RL-188**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 80.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 82 \u2013 83.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that, given that Rotalin sought to invoke the jurisdiction of Moldovan courts, this matter falls outside the scope of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.94 The Tribunal cannot interfere or enjoin a State from its legal, judicial or administrative activities.95 For the Respondent, the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings does not extend to proceedings over which Moldovan courts have jurisdiction.96 The Respondent argues that since the Suspension Decision is an administrative one, instead of an investment dispute, it falls outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.97\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 85.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 86.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 87 \u2013 88.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 88.\n\n3. Rotalin Failed to Comply with Moldovan Law and Cannot Seek ECT Protection\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, under Article 1(6)(f) of the ECT, an operation only qualifies as an investment if it is \"*pursuant to law,*\" that is, in accordance with the host State's law.98 Relying on *Plama v. Bulgaria,* the Respondent argues that substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments made contrary to law.99\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 96 \u2013 99.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6 84; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, at \u00b6 138 (**Exhibit RL-64**). *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Provisional Measures, September 6, 2005, \u00b6 38 (**Exhibit RL-26**).\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, as a supply license holder, Rotalin was obliged under Articles 11, 13(3), 89, 15(1)(c), 80(4), 114(4) and 1585 of the Law on Natural Gas to supply continuously and uninterruptedly gas to its customers.100 However, Rotalin abruptly ceased supplying gas to its approximate 20,000 customers amidst Moldova's state of emergency101 and refused to provide gas service to its customers even in an unregulated market where it had no PSO,102 only because of its discord with ANRE vis-a-vis the tariff surplus of MDL 38,453,860.103 Noting that the recovery of the tariff surplus would become impossible both in fact and in law if Rotalin no longer participated in the regulated market,104 the Respondent asserts that Rotalin's request to be removed from that market and to terminate its PSO was an attempt to avoid the recoupment of the excess sums Rotalin owed to its customers.105\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 86 \u2013 87.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 88.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 89.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 90.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 91.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 92.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent argues that ANRE's actions are not, as the Claimants assert, arbitrary or directed at Rotalin106 in the sense expressed by *Saluka v. Czech Republic*.107 In fact, according to the Respondent, ANRE is *obliged* under Article 113(2) of the Law on Natural Gas to apply the financial penalty in the case of revocation of the PSO.108 Moreover, ANRE did not single out Rotalin for financial penalties: it also applied a fine to Moldovatransgaz S.R.L, by way of a financial sanction of 10% of the latter's annual turnover for the year 2022.109 The Respondent argues that Rotalin is effectively requesting that the Tribunal grant it preferential treatment and a recourse to avoid the consequences of its breach of the law.110\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 96.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 95; *Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award, 17 March 2006 at \u00b6 304 (**Exhibit RL-134**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 97.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 98.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 99.\n\n4. *Prima Facie* Existence of the Right Sought to Be Preserved\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimants' position that they are *prima facie* entitled to the rights that they seek to protect through the Claimants' Second Request.111\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 122.\n\n69.\n\nNoting that provisional measures are intended to preserve the parties' rights and not to protect their mere expectations,112 the Respondent argues that the Claimants were required to prove that a link exists between the \"*rights to be preserved*\" and the fair consideration of their requests for relief. For the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to establish any such link.113\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 101.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 104 - 105.\n\n70.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to identify (i) \"*ANY right that must be preserved*;\"114 (ii) \"*any law that identifies the evasion of law as a protectable right*;\"115 (iii) \"*any law that defines as a protectable right, the alleged 'injury' which is a direct result of the movants' breach of the host state laws*;\"116 (iv) \"*any law that names Rotalin's discarding its obligation to the public because it disagrees with ANRE's financial calculations as a protected right*;\"117 (v) \"*any law that identifies Rotalin' excess charges made to its public customers, as protected right*;\"118 (vi)\"*any law that recognizes Rotalin's refusal to reimburse its public the overcharges it made, as a protected right*;\"119 (vii) \"*any law that recognizes as a protected right the argument that Rotalin spent money it knew was owed to the public and now claim it has no funds to do [sic] pay the financial sanctions*\"120; (viii) \"*any law that Rotalin has a right to force ANRE to breach its obligations to impose the financial sanction to protect the public*;\"121 and (viii) \"*any law that labels Rotalin has a protected right to prevent ANRE to impose a sum for Rotalin's breaches in an amount similar to that owned by Rotalin to its customers.*\"122 To the contrary \u2013 the Respondent asserts (i) \"*all of the law denies ECT protection to a claimant who has breached the law*\";123 (ii) \"*given that Rotalin failed to submit a valid tariff request for almost 20 years, it cannot now link its managerial incompetence to its inability to pay*;\"124 (iii) Rotalin could have avoided the fine; and (iv) \"*Rotalin could have supplied gas without its PSO in an unregulated market.\"125*\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6107.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6108.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6109.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6110.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6111.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6112.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6113.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6114.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6115.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 116.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 119.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 120.\n\n5. Necessity\n------------\n\n71.\n\nRelying on case law, the Respondent argues that provisional measures should only be ordered where, absent such measures, protected rights would be definitely lost.126 In contrast, measures will not be necessary where a party can be adequately compensated by an award of money.127 The Respondent argues that Rotalin admitted that the rights at issue are purely economical, and on that basis the granting of Claimants' Second Request is not warranted.128\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 123.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 124.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 125.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, should the Tribunal reject this proposition, there must be a high likelihood of harm,129 or irreparable harm if provisional measures are not granted. For the Respondent, irreparable harm is such harm that cannot be repaired by an award of damages.130 In light of Rotalin's decision to cease natural gas supply to all its customers in both regulated and unregulated markets,131 its requests to have the PSO revoked, and its choice not to challenge the revocation of the PSO before the Court,132 Rotalin knowingly and voluntarily assumed the fine.133\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 127 - 128; *Gerald International Limited v. Republic of Sierra Leone*, ICSID Case No. ARB/19/31, Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on Rotalin's Request for Provisional Measures), 28 July 2020, \u00b6 177 (**Exhibit RL-34**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 129 - 130; *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 156 (**Exhibit RL-32**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 132 \u2013 133.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 134 \u2013 135.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 136.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, considering all the opportunities Rotalin had to avoid the fine but failed to take, Rotalin's requests are unwarranted because there is no risk or threat that any grave or serious harm will come to Rotalin.134 The Respondent asserts that Rotalin is using this arbitration to avert its obligations under Moldovan laws.135\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 137 \u2013 138.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 141.\n\n6. Non-Aggravation of Dispute\n-----------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the applicability of the principle of non-aggravation in this case because, in its view, Rotalin is seeking to improve its position, rather than to maintain the status quo. Relying on case law,136 including *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic*,137 the Respondent submits that provisional measures are not intended to improve a claimant's position, but rather to preserve the status quo. In the Respondents' view, the fact that circumstances continue to evolve during the course of the case is not in itself sufficient to justify provisional measures.138\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 142 \u2013 143; *Amco Asia v. Indonesia*, Decision on request for provisional measures of 9 December 1983, ICSID Reports, 1993, p. 412 (**Exhibit RL-38**).\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Decision on Provisional Measures, February 15, 2004, \u00b6 37 (**Exhibit RL-37**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 147.\n\n75.\n\nSeparately, the Respondent argues that the Claimants' Second Request cannot be granted because it would amount to granting the final relief being sought in the case.139\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 150.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"*Rotalin has not claimed, nor can it, that the fine has changed the status quo Rotalin created*.\" In this respect, relying on *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, the Respondent argues that Rotalin knowingly and voluntarily assumed the fine and therefore must bear the consequences of its conduct.140\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 155 \u2013 156.\n\n77.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that the right to non-aggravation of the dispute is a right to prevent changes of circumstances which threaten the ability of the Tribunal to grant the relief which a party seeks and the capability of giving effect to the relief.141 Rotalin has not shown any evidence that the Tribunal has the capability of giving effect to the relief that Rotalin sought as Rotalin caused the fine to be imposed due to its non-compliance with the law.142\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 157.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 158.\n\n7. Urgency\n----------\n\n78.\n\nReferring to *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*143 and *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*,144 the Respondent argues that a provisional measure is urgent if action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before the final decision is made,145 or if there is a need to obtain the requested measure at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award.146 The Respondent contends that ANRE's imposition of the fine is not prejudicial to Rotalin's rights.147\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 3, 18 January 2005, \u00b6 8 (**Exhibit RL-41**).\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, \u00b6 76 (**Exhibit RL-42**).\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 159.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 160.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 161.\n\n8. Proportionality\n------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the harm to be avoided must substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.148 The Respondent argues that this is not the case here.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 170 \u2013 173.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent contends that any harm to Rotalin is self-imposed as it itself sought to be relieved of the PSO, and therefore to pull out of the regulated gas supply market. In fact, the Respondent alleges that Rotalin sought to revoke the PSO to \"*retain profit that it gained illegally by charging its 20,000 gas customers*.\"149 Further, the Respondent argues that Rotalin did not have to request the revocation of the PSO, or cease operating as a natural gas supplier via the unregulated market. Additionally, it could also have initiated proceedings in the Moldovan court.150\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 174 \u2013 178.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 179 \u2013 181.\n\n81.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent argues that the fine imposed by ANRE was proportionate as it (i) reflects the least amounts which Rotalin should have reimbursed to the customers to whom it had overcharged;151 and (ii) corresponds to the gravity of Rotalin's actions and inactions, especially since it was aware that it was unlawful to \"*obtain, and spend unjustified revenues*\" in the amount of MDL 38,453,860.152\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 183 \u2013 184.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 185 \u2013 186.\n\n82.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent argues that applying only the minimum penalty of 5% of turnover required by Law No. 429 \"*would be unfair to the public who will not recoup its excess billing,*\"153 in particular where the imposition of the fine would also set standards for other suppliers to comply with.154 The fine is also not excessive or in violation of any law, as Article 113(2)(g) of the Law on Natural Gas does not set any maximum limit.155 Further, the fine was also not a double sanction, as Rotalin has not been sanctioned previously for the same acts.156 Lastly, Article 20(10) of the Law on Energy allowed a reduction of the fine if Rotalin paid it within 72 hours from the date it received the decision.157\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 187.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 188.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 189.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 192 \u2013 195.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 200.\n\n83.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that Rotalin's purpose of bringing the Second Request is to have a mechanism to exit the Moldovan market without complying with its financial obligation.158 On this basis, the Respondent argues that allowing the Claimants' Second Request would violate the integrity of the arbitration.159\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 201 \u2013 203.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 204 \u2013 206.\n\n9. Costs\n--------\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimants' claim for costs against it,160 and instead makes its own claim for costs incurred in preparing its responses to the Claimants' Second Request.161\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 207.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 209-210.\n\n**IV. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out below its considerations relating to the Claimants' Second Request. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that neither Party has requested an oral hearing in relation to the Claimants' Second Request. Accordingly, similar to the Claimants' First Request, the Tribunal has decided the Claimants' Second Request on the papers.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal will now recall its power to grant provisional measures in Section IV(A), and the relevant legal standard in Section IV(B), before applying that standard to the case at hand in Section IV(C).\n\n*A. Power to Grant Preliminary Measures*\n----------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal has already set out the principles governing, and considerations relevant to, its power to order provisional measures. The Tribunal recalls them below.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules vests the Tribunal with the power to grant provisional measures. Paragraph 1 of Article 46 specifically provides that:\n\n\"*Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such a request*.\"\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute the Tribunal's power to grant provisional measures.162 Instead, it argues that provisional measures are an exceptional remedy and the Tribunal must exercise \"*its discretion only with the strict confines of the power granted*\"163 and *\"recommend only the minimum steps necessary*\" when granting provisional measures.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 69.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 70.\n\n*B. Legal Standard for Granting Preliminary Measures*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nAs the Tribunal has previously noted, Article 46(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules does not provide any guidance as to how arbitral tribunals should exercise their discretion in granting provisional measures.164 The Tribunal recalls its discussion of the legal standard from Procedural Order No. 3 summarized below:\n\na. Arbitral tribunals have over time distilled the conditions pursuant to which provisional measures may be granted. By way of example, in interpreting Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules and the related case law, the tribunal in *Anderson v. Costa Rica* emphasized that the two key factors that must be present to justify the granting of provisional measures are that \"*the measures must be necessary to preserve a party's rights*\" and that \"*the need for such measures must be urgent to avoid irreparable harm*.\"165\n\nb. It is generally appropriate to refer to case law relating to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and/or ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) when interpreting Article 46(1) of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.166\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6122. *See also* Respondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 67.\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson et al v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Decision on Provisional Measures, 5 November 2008, \u00b6 20 (**Exhibit CL-140**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 123.\n\n91.\n\nIn exercising its discretion to recommend or order provisional measures under Article 46 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from the criteria it laid out in Procedural Order No. 3. These are:\n\na. Whether the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to hear the s' claims;\n\nb. Whether the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded;\n\nc. Whether the requested measures are necessary to avoid irreparable harm to the Claimants' rights; and\n\nd. Whether the requested measures are proportionate.167\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 129.\n\n92.\n\nIn the sections that follow, the Tribunal applies the relevant legal standard to the facts.\n\n*C. Applying the Legal Standard to the Case*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1. *Prima Facie* Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal set out its assessment of the *prima facie jurisdiction* in this case. In summary, the Tribunal noted the following:\n\na. The screening performed by the ICSID Secretary-General when registering the case is insufficient to demonstrate *prima facie* jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims.168 As Article 5 of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules clarifies, when notifying the parties of the registration of a request, the Secretary-General \"*remind[s] the parties that the registration of the request is without prejudice to the powers and functions of the Arbitral Tribunal in regard to competence and merits*.\"169\n\nb. The Tribunal has already found in its Decision on Bifurcation that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections were not *prima facie* serious.170\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 131.\n\nICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules (2006), Art. 5(d) (**Exhibit CL-002**); *see also* Screening of an Application for Access and of a Request, and Registration \u2013 Additional Facility Arbitration (2006) Rules (**Exhibit CL-142**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, Decision on Bifurcation, 11 October 2023, \u00b6 43.\n\n94.\n\nSince the time the Decision on Bifurcation was issued, the Respondent has:\n\na. made an argument that in applying to the Moldovan courts to relieve itself of the PSO, Rotalin has submitted to the jurisdiction of the Moldovan courts and accordingly now falls outside of the scope of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention;171 and\n\nb. submitted its Counter-Memorial which contains a detailed articulation of its jurisdictional objections. This Counter-Memorial was filed after Procedural Order No. 3 was issued.\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimants' Second Request, \u00b6 85.\n\n95.\n\nHaving reviewed these further submissions from the Respondent, the Tribunal does not consider that there is any reason to deviate from its previous finding that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction in this case. The Tribunal clarifies again that in reaching a conclusion as to *prima facie* jurisdiction, it does not indicate its prospective decision on jurisdiction over this case. The Tribunal is not required at this stage to finally decide the questions relating to its jurisdiction.\n\n2. *Prima Facie* Merits\n-----------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal assesses in this section whether the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded. In Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal has already found that the Claimants have established a *prima facie* case in relation to their claims. In particular:\n\na. Noting the decision in *Paushok v. Mongolia*, the Tribunal found that the standard for the *prima facie* establishment of the merits of the case was not particularly high.172\n\nb. Noting the decision in the *Oil Platforms* case,173 the Tribunal found that it was required to accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged by the Claimants for the purpose of assessing whether the Claimants had a *prima facie* case on the merits.174\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 139.\n\n*See, e.g.,* \u00a0*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 129 \u2013131 (**Exhibit CL-143**); *David Minnotte and Robert Lewis v. Republic of Poland,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/10/1, Award, 16 May 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 143 \u2013 145 (**Exhibit CL-144**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 140.\n\n97.\n\nAs already decided in Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal finds that there is no indication that, at this stage, the Claimants' claims are \u2013 on their face \u2013 frivolous. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Claimants' claims are *prima facie* well-founded. In doing so, the Tribunal does not in any way prejudge any issues of fact or law which may be raised by the Parties during these proceedings concerning the merits of the Claimants' claims.\n\n3. Necessity\n------------\n\n98.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal assesses whether the requested measures are necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the Claimants' rights.\n\n99.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal must identify the rights whose protection the Claimants seek in the Claimants' Second Request. As the Tribunal noted with reference to the decision in *Plama v. Bulgaria* in Procedural Order No. 3, the provisional measures requested must bear a sufficient link with the subject matter of the underlying dispute.175 However, as the Tribunal has also clarified in Procedural Order No. 3, the rights to which the Claimants are entitled to seek protection may be substantive rights but may also include procedural rights, including the right to non-aggravation of the dispute.176 As the tribunal in *Burlington v. Ecuador* has recognised, these are self-standing rights that can be protected by an order of provisional measures.177\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 147 referring to *Plama Consortium Ltd v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40 (**Exhibit RL-026**).\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 145 \u2013 146.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. and others v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente's Request for Provisional Measures, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 60 (**Exhibit RL-040**); Procedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 146.\n\na) Rights the Claimants Seek to Protect\n---------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nHaving recalled these observations, the Tribunal begins by identifying the rights whose protection the Claimants seek through their application for provisional measures.\n\n101.\n\nAs discussed above, through the Claimants' Second Request, they seek the protection of \"*the right to be heard, the right to a fair proceedings and the protection of the integrity of the arbitration as a whole by preventing Respondent from expropriating Claimants, pushing Rotalin into insolvency and seizing all its assets and property*,\" and \"**the Claimants are seeking to maintain the status quo of the arbitration**\" which they allege are required to \"*prevent unnecessary exacerbation of the relevant disputes*.\"178\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6\u00b6 40 \u2013 41.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal understands from this articulation that the rights the Claimants seek to protect are (i) the right to be heard, (ii) the right to fair proceedings, (iii) the right to protection of the integrity of the proceedings, and (iv) the right to seek the maintenance of *status quo* as part of a general right to non-aggravation of disputes.179 The Tribunal notes that the procedural rights sought to be protected (i.e., the right to be heard, the right to fair proceedings, and the right to protection of the integrity of the proceedings) may in this case be considered to be inextricably related and encompassed in the overall right to a fair trial.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, at \u00b6\u00b6 40 \u2013 41.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, unlike the Claimants' First Request, in the Claimants' Second Request they have not sought the protection of any alleged right to be protected against unfair or inequitable conduct or expropriatory conduct as an independent right which should be protected by an order of provisional measures.\n\nb) Link Between the Measures Requested and Rights at Issue\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal noted that \"*some of the rights the Claimants seek to protect by the requested provisional measures are sufficiently linked to the underlying dispute, such as the general right to maintain the status quo ante or to avoid the non-aggravation of the dispute*.\"180 These rights included \"*the general right to maintain the status quo ante or to avoid the non-aggravation of the dispute*.\"181 The Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from that finding, or to find any differently for the Claimants' right to a fair trial: these rights are sufficiently linked to the dispute.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 148.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 148.\n\n4. Risk of Irreparable Harm\n---------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimants argue that the enforcement of the fine (Decision No. 342) would endanger their right to continue with this arbitration. The Claimants argue that this risk arises because (i) the fine constitutes 19% of Rotalin's turnover,182 (ii) Rotalin does not have the funds to make such a payment (or even half of it),183 and (iii) Rotalin's inability to pay the fine is likely to invite enforcement action from the Moldovan authorities.184 The Respondent does not, in particular, deny either that Rotalin has insufficient financial resources to make the payment, or that failure to make payment will invite enforcement action from the Moldovan authorities.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 1.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 45.\n\n106.\n\nIndeed, the cash flow projections for 2024 \u2013 although not audited \u2013 provide support for the Claimants' assertion that Rotalin does not have sufficient funds to pay the fine, or even half of it. The document indicates that the cash balance at the end of May 2024 was MDL 13.27 million.185 This amount \u2013 even as at the end of May 2024 \u2013 was lower than the fine of MDL 38.5 million imposed on Rotalin. Even though the document is titled \"*cash flow projections,*\" it appears to indicate *actual* numbers in relation to May 2024, and projected numbers from June 2024 onwards.186 The Tribunal therefore finds it reasonable to rely on this document as sufficient proof, at this stage, that Rotalin does not have the liquid assets to pay the full amount of the fine imposed on it. While it is not possible for the Tribunal to find that ANRE necessarily will initiate enforcement action, the Tribunal must consider that a risk of enforcement exists. The Respondent has not denied that the enforcement of the fine and possible other steps including seizure of Rotalin's assets could follow the imposition of the fine. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that there is a risk of harm with regard to the fine imposed by Decision No. 342 of 4 June 2024.\n\nRotalin's P&L Cash Flow Projection for 2024, (**Exhibit C-320**).\n\nRotalin's P&L Cash Flow Projection for 2024, (**Exhibit C-320**).\n\n107.\n\nTo the contrary, the Tribunal is currently unconvinced that a similar risk exists with regard to Decision No. 44 of 30 January 2024, as amended by Decision No. 211 of 27 March 2024, finding the alleged surplus of MDL 38.5 million.187 Indeed, the Claimants have not provided sufficient evidence showing a risk that the Respondent \u2013 at this stage \u2013 would enforce Decision No. 44, *in addition* to the fine imposed by Decision No. 342. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that there is no risk of harm with regard to Decision No. 44.\n\nANRE Decision No. 44, 30 January 2024, p. 2 (**Exhibit C-322**).\n\n108.\n\nHaving established the risk of a harm (in relation to Decision No. 342), the Tribunal now considers whether said harm is irreparable. As noted above, the Respondent argues that monetary compensation is an adequate remedy for the breaches the Claimants allege against the Respondent and that any harm would therefore not be irreparable. The Tribunal does not agree. First, as the Tribunal noted in Procedural Order No. 3, in *Paushok v. Mongolia* the \"*possibility of monetary compensation does not necessarily eliminate the need for interim measures*.\"188 Second, even though it is true that monetary compensation *could* in certain circumstances mean that harm caused to a claimant's investment is reparable because damages can be awarded equivalent to the harm caused to the investment, it is not clear that an award of damages will adequately repair *procedural* rights that are at risk of being endangered. This is particularly true because where procedural rights are violated, that also affects a party's ability to secure the monetary compensation.\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Co. and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Co. v. Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 68 (**Exhibit CL-139**).\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal now addresses the Respondent's further argument in this regard: that Rotalin was aware of the fine, voluntarily assumed the fine, and therefore could have avoided the fine by continuing to supply gas. While the Tribunal does not need to make *definitive* findings on the facts alleged by the Respondent, the Tribunal is satisfied that, at best, Rotalin accepted that *a* fine would be levied, but not that a fine *of MDL 38.5 million* would be levied. It is thus important in this regard to distinguish between the acceptance in principle that a fine would be levied, and the quantum or amount of the fine.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties that Rotalin stopped providing gas to its customers in October 2023. The circumstances relating to the decision to stop supply and the reasons for it appear to be in dispute between the Parties. However, it is not in dispute that Rotalin could have avoided the fine if it continued to supply gas.\n\n111.\n\nWithout making a finding on whether Rotalin was in a position to continue supplying gas or whether it was economically feasible for Rotalin to do so, the Tribunal notes that it is possible to take a view that Rotalin knew that continued non-compliance with its PSO would likely lead to a fine. Even though its position is that under the law as it stood when it stopped supplying gas, no fine could be levied for such non-supply, there is no dispute that at least from 28 December 2023, there was a law in place which allowed the imposition of a fine for such non-supply.189 Therefore, the possibility of the imposition of a fine was \u2013 or at least ought to have been \u2013 a consideration of Rotalin's decision to continue refusing to supply gas even after December 2023.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 46.\n\n112.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that Rotalin accepted the possibility of a fine that would be comparable in amount to the MDL 38.5 million eventually imposed on it.\n\na. The Claimants submit, and the Respondent does not dispute, that the fine of MDL 38.5 million is the largest fine ever imposed in Moldova.190 It therefore cannot be presumed that Rotalin could have expected this quantum of fine, irrespective of whether the fine imposed by ANRE reflected the amounts which Rotalin should have allegedly reimbursed to overcharged customers and whether the fine is proportionate to the gravity of Rotalin's alleged actions and inactions.\n\nb. ANRE provided that under the amended 2016 Gas Law, it is mandatory that Rotalin would be fined at least 5% of its turnover.191\n\nc. The Tribunal accepts that 5% is the *minimum* as opposed to a *maximum* fine. However, it indicates that the calculation of fines could be expected to be based (in terms of methodology) on a percentage of turnover, rather than on calculations of a prior tariff surplus. It also indicates that Rotalin's acceptance of the principle of a fine must be seen as being inherently linked to the notion that it accepted a fine of a minimum of 5% of its turnover. While Rotalin perhaps could have expected a fine exceeding 5% of its turnover, this is not sufficient basis to infer that it could have expected a fine of 19% of its turnover.\n\nd. The Announced Fine in November 2023 was also in line with the expectation that the fine would likely be around 5% of the turnover.192 Contemporaneous evidence, including Rotalin's letter dated 9 February 2024, indicates that Rotalin expected the risk to be the following: \"*the risk to be fined an amount of 5% of its turnover (8 million lei)*\" for the stoppage of its supply.193 The Tribunal further understands that the Claimants may have been prepared to pay the Announced Fine \u2013 or possibly at least half of it, in light of Article 20(20) of Law No. 174 of 21 September 2017 on Energy, which entitles energy companies to pay only half of the amount of a financial penalty if they pay it no later than 72 hours after receiving the decision imposing the penalty.194\n\ne. Rotalin's expectation of a fine in the range of 5% \u2013 but not about three times that amount \u2013 also appears to be justified when considering that ANRE imposed a fine of 10% of the turnover on Moldovatransgaz.195\n\nf. The year of turnover and amount of turnover appear to be in dispute between the Parties. While Decision No. 342 of 4 June 2024 is based on Rotalin's 2023 turnover, the amount of which is also in dispute between the Parties,196 the Announced Fine based on the 2022 turnover. The Tribunal has not been presented with evidence as to what year of turnover should be considered for the calculation of any fine and the Tribunal also has not been presented with concrete evidence of either the 2022 or 2023 turnover.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nThe text of the amended provision of the 2016 Gas Law is set out at \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants' Email to Tribunal of 17 November 2024 and ANRE Press Release, 17 November 2024 (**Exhibit C-317**).\n\nLetter from Rotalin to Energy Community Secretariat, 9 February 2024 (**Exhibit C-319**).\n\nArticle 20(20) of Law No. 174 of 21 September 2017 on Energy (Exhibit **MM-008**).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that documentary support for this assertion of the Claimants only indicates that a fine of MDL 33.9 was imposed but does not indicate the turnover of Moldovatransgaz. However, the Respondent appears to confirm the Claimants' assertion that the fine amounted to \"10% of the annual turnover for the entity's 2022 year,\" Respondent's Observation on the Claimant's Second Request, \u00b6199.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, fn 3; Respondent's Observation on the Claimant's Second Request, \u00b6 63.\n\n113.\n\nOn this basis the Tribunal finds that Rotalin did not accept the possibility of a fine of MDL 38.5 million. Accordingly, having found that Rotalin is at risk of bankruptcy following enforcement actions of the Moldovan authorities, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is a risk of irreparable harm if the collection of the fine is not, at least partially, suspended.\n\n5. Proportionality\n------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal then turns to the final criterion for the grant of provisional measures in this case: whether the requested measure is proportionate. The Tribunal notes that while there is no universally accepted articulation of this criterion, it is rather uncontroversial that provisional measures require an assessment of the relative burdens of the parties.\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a slightly stricter test and relies on the decisions of the Tribunal in *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, which found that the principle of proportionality requires that \"*harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result for the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.*\"197\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 26 February 2010, \u00b6 71 (**Exhibit RL-032**).\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that it must consider the consequences on the Respondent if the provisional measures requested are *granted* and compare those to the consequences on the Claimants if the provisional measures requested are *not* granted.\n\n117.\n\nHere, if the Tribunal *refrains* from granting any provisional measure sought by the Claimants, as discussed above, there is a risk of irreparable harm to the procedural rights of Rotalin. The full fine is of such amount that its enforcement would likely lead to the bankruptcy of Rotalin and affect its right to participate in the arbitration. The Respondent does not disagree with these probable consequences of the enforcement of the fine of MDL 38.5 million.\n\n118.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Tribunal *grants* some of the provisional measures requested, it would be open to Moldova in the future to recover the fine against such assets as Rotalin then has available. While the amount of Rotalin's cash reserves may fluctuate over time, the Tribunal understands that Rotalin's main physical assets are in Moldova,198 and it will be open for the Respondent ultimately to enforce against those assets if it prevails in this case yet the Claimants prove unable to pay any fines lawfully imposed. The Tribunal is therefore convinced that not granting *any* provisional measures would impose severe consequences on the procedural rights of the Claimants, while the impact on the Respondent of granting *some* form of provisional measure may be capable of remedy in future.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 60.\n\n119.\n\nHowever, it does not automatically follow that the entirety of the Claimants' request (i.e., preventing the Respondent from taking steps to enforce *any* of the MDL 38.5 million fine against Rotalin) would be proportionate. In this context, the Tribunal recalls \u2013 as it did in Procedural Order No. 3 \u2013 that the Tribunal is obliged to ensure that it does not grant provisional measures that are broader than necessary to protect the rights alleged to be at risk.\n\n120.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Nova v. Romania* explained:\n\n*\"[i]f the particular measure sought by the applicant is broader than required \u2026 to preserve the right in question, that portion of the measure will be neither necessary nor urgent, and almost by definition will impose burdens on the other party that are disproportionate to the claimed need.\"*199\n\n*Nova Group Investments, B.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/19, Decision on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 243 (**Exhibit RL-029**).\n\n121.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal's granting of provisional measures is aimed at preventing the risk to the procedural rights of the Claimants that would arise as a result of the bankruptcy of Rotalin following the enforcement of the fine. However, as the Claimants admit, Rotalin was \"*preparing to pay*\" an amount calculated at \"*(half of) the* [A]*nnounced* [F]*ine of ca MDL 12 million*\" in November 2023.200 The Announced Fine was roughly in the region of 5% of Rotalin's 2022 turnover, with the 5% threshold corresponding to the minimum level of fines that ANRE now may assess under Law No. 429. While Rotalin's intent is not entirely clear from the Claimants' submissions, it may be that it was prepared to pay \"*half of*\" the Announced Fine,201 in light of Article 20(1) of the 2017 Energy Law, in order to prevent enforcement of the remainder of the Announced Fine during the duration of any legal challenges.202\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants' Second Request, \u00b6 2 & n. 4 (explaining the operation of Article 20(1) of the Energy Law)\n\n122.\n\nIn the Claimants' Second Request, the Claimants do not allege that paying the approximately MDL 12 million Announced Fine (or half of it) would have resulted in Rotalin's bankruptcy, in the way that Claimants allege the eventual fine of MDL 38.5 million would. Moreover, the Tribunal has not been informed of any change in the Claimants' ability to pay such sums in the period following the making of the Claimants' Second Request.\n\n123.\n\nFrom the perspective of proportionality, there is value in securing for the Respondent the possibility of payment of at least such portion of the currently challenged fine as the Claimants admit that Rotalin were preparing to pay based on the earlier Announced Fine, even while challenging the appropriateness of any such fine. Not securing these funds would leave the Respondent worse off than if it had never revised the fine levels upward in the first place, particularly given Claimants' repeated protestations of financial instability. At the same time, so long as such payment is secured during the pendency of these proceedings \u2013 for example, through some sort of escrow account \u2013 it is not essential that that the funds actually change hands. The Respondent's interests would be protected by the establishment of an escrow, at least to the level of the minimum fines required by Law No. 429 read in conjunction with Article 20(1) of the 2017 Energy Law. Indeed, the securing of liquid funds in this amount would ensure that the Respondent's only remedy *if it prevails* on this point is not the extreme one of attaching Rotalin's physical assets. And while the Claimants would still lose the use of the escrowed funds while the case is ongoing, the return of these funds to Rotalin *if Claimants prevail* on this point would be easier than if the funds were transferred to the Respondent outright.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this type of arrangement to be a middle-ground which is more proportionate to both Parties than the extremes of either (i) granting all the relief the Claimants seek, or (ii) denying any relief to the Claimants, as the Respondent seeks. The Tribunal's goal is to impose no more burden on the Parties than is strictly necessary for the protection of the Claimants' procedural rights. The Tribunal finds that the placement of sums into an escrow account allows the Tribunal to balance the interests of both Parties pending the outcome of the case. The Tribunal determines this amount to be MDL 6,028,567.20 (i.e., half of the Announced Fine) which the Claimants said, at a minimum, they were prepared to pay.203\n\nSee above at \u00b6 112(d), 121.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n125.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. Orders the Respondent to prevent the seizure of Rotalin's assets, bank accounts and other property in Moldova as a result of the enforcement of Decision No. 342 of 4 June 2024, imposing a fine of MDL 38.5 million against Rotalin;\n\nb. Orders the Claimants to establish an escrow account with an independent financial institution, to remain in place for the duration of this case or until otherwise ordered by the Tribunal, into which they shall place MDL 6,028,567.20;\n\nc. Notes that the measure at paragraph (a) will only be maintained if the Claimants comply with the order at paragraph (b) within a reasonable timeframe;\n\nd. Dismisses the remainder of the Claimants' Second Request; and\n\ne. Reserves its decision on costs arising out of the Claimants' Second Request.\n\nDate: 15 July 2024"}]}
