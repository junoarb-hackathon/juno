PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn March 27, 2007, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") registered a request for arbitration from 135 individual nationals of Canada (\"the Claimants\") against the Republic of Costa Rica (\"the Respondent\" or \"Costa Rica\"), alleging various breaches of domestic and international law, in particular the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica and the Government of Canada for the Protection and Promotion of Investment, signed on March 18, 1998. Pursuant to the procedures of the Centre, in particular the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (the \"Arbitration AF Rules\"), this Tribunal was formally constituted on May 2, 2008 to decide the case. A first session was subsequently scheduled to discuss preliminary procedural matters.\n\n2.\n\nDuring the course of the first session held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C., on June 27, 2008, the counsel for the Respondent, Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, mentioned his intention to submit a request for certain provisional measures. On this point, the Tribunal invited the counsel for the Respondent to present a written request within the terms and conditions of the rules applicable to this case.\n\n3.\n\nThe Secretariat of the Centre received the Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures (\"the Request\") on July 8, 2008. Specifically, it requested:\n\n(i) that the Tribunal order the Claimants to post a bank guarantee (or an escrow account deposit administered by ICSID) equivalent to the ICSID administrative fees that the Respondent may incur during the course of the proceedings on jurisdiction; and\n\n(ii) that the Tribunal order Claimants to represent that they agree to be held jointly and severally liable for any amounts that the Tribunal may award to cover Respondent's legal fees and expenses.1\n\nThe Secretariat forwarded the Request to the Claimants for their observations, in accordance with instructions given by the Tribunal. On August 6, 2008, the Claimants filed their Response to the Respondent's Request for Provisional Measures (\"the Response\"). In such Response the Claimants contest each and all of Claimants' requests and accordingly asked the Tribunal not to impose any provisional measures.\n\nPara. 24 of the Request.\n\n**II. THE RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n----------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent grounds the Request for Provisional Measures on Article 46(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules which provides that:\n\n\"[u]nless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at anytime during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal.\"\n\nAsserting that Article 46(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules is equivalent to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 39 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), the Respondent argues that this Tribunal clearly has authority to order provisional measures and that such measures may take a variety of forms, referring to various cases in the past in which arbitral tribunals have considered ordering such measures.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the provisional measures requested are justified because of alleged \"unusual circumstances\" presented by the present case. The unusual circumstances, according to the Respondent, arise from three factors: (i) the unusual nature of the Claimants in this case; (ii) the difficulties in enforcing any eventual award of costs against the Claimants because of their unusual nature; and (iii) the unusual nature of the claims asserted by the Claimants. The effect of these unusual circumstances, according to the Respondent, is to increase the risk of non-payment by the Claimants of any costs that this Tribunal might award to the Respondent at the conclusion of this proceeding.\n\n6.\n\nWith respect the first of the above-indicated factors, Respondent submits that unlike the ordinary ICSID cases in which claimants are one or a few corporations, about which adequate information is usually available or accessible, the Claimants in the present case consist of 135 separate individuals (some of whom are heirs or beneficiaries of persons now deceased), about which the Respondent has very little information. Moreover, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants do not seem to have sufficient economic solvency to make such payments, as evidenced by their proposal for witnesses to testify remotely, rather than to travel in person to ICSID hearings; by the existence of contingency fee arrangements with their counsel, and by the Claimants' many difficulties in registering their claims with ICSID.\n\n7.\n\nWith respect to the special difficulties of enforcing any award in its favor because of a possible refusal by individual Claimants to pay costs awarded against them, the Respondent points out three difficulties occasioned by the existence in this case of 135 physical persons as Claimants. The Respondent first notes that it is not clear that all the Claimants have assets located within a single Canadian jurisdiction. As a result, Respondent would have the onerous task of locating Claimants' assets throughout Canada and pursuing multiple enforcement actions in many jurisdictions. Second, even if Claimants' assets were located in a single Canadian jurisdiction, the Respondent would still have the costly and onerous task of pursuing a number of legal actions. Third, the respective shares of liability of each of the 135 Claimants would have to be determined in order to bring any legal action against them in any jurisdiction, thus further complicating enforcement.\n\n8.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the highly unusual nature of the Claimants and the nature of their claims raise serious doubts as to the soundness and propriety of their case and that therefore the Respondent has a reasonable basis for obtaining a favourable award on costs.\n\n**III. THE CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS AGAINST PROVISIONAL MEASURES**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nAt the outset of their Response, the Claimants acknowledge that the Tribunal has the authority to recommend the adoption of provisional measures to grant the relief sought. However, the Claimants also argue that such measures have an exceptional character and may be granted only in extreme cases.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent has not provided any basis to demonstrate that the present case is extreme, and moreover has not identified a single precedent granting the required relief in other similar cases.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants further state that the arguments of the Respondent are based on suppositions and conjectures, and they then proceed to reject each of the points advanced by the Respondent in support of its Request. With respect to the alleged unusual nature of the Claimants and the nonexistence of information regarding them, the Claimants consider that such factors in and of themselves do not imply a risk of non-payment. As far as testifying remotely, the Claimants referred to numerous ICSID cases that have used the technology of teleconferencing and video conferencing to demonstrate that the use of such technologies is a common practice and is not evidence of a party's insolvency or lack of financial capacity. With respect to contingency fee arrangements for the payment of legal counsel, the Claimants argue that such arrangements do not evidence a risk of non-payment of costs that might be awarded. In addition, the supposed difficulties in the enforcement of such obligations, according to the Claimants, are based on hypothesis and suppositions and are without foundation. Moreover, the practice of ICSID tribunals with respect to the awarding costs does not justify the assumption that even if the Respondent succeeded on the merits of the present case that the Tribunal would automatically award costs against the Claimants.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants also reject the Respondent's request that the Tribunal declare that the Claimants be held jointly and severally liable for any costs that may be awarded against them at the end of this case. Claimants point out that they are separate individual investors, were not participants in a common investment, and did not act jointly in anyway.\n\n13.\n\nIn further support of their case, the Claimants presented the expert opinion of Dr. Enrique Rojas Franco, an expert in Costa Rican public law, to the effect that the imposition of provisional measures, such as those requested by the Respondent, would not be ordered under Costa Rican domestic law because such measures would constitute a denial of due process and access to justice.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the parties through their pleadings have provided it with sufficient elements and arguments to make a decision on the Respondent's Request; consequently the Tribunal considers it is unnecessary to hold an additional hearing specifically to receive further arguments by the parties in this respect.\n\n**B. LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n----------------------\n\n15.\n\nProvisional measures in ICSID cases under the Additional Facility are governed by Article 46 of the Arbitration AF Rules. Paragraph (1) of Article 46, the relevant provision with respect to the Respondent's Request, provides as follows:\n\n(1) Unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides, either party may at any time during the proceeding request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be ordered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\nThus, paragraph (1) of Article 46 of the Arbitration AF Rules, contemplates the possibility of requests by either party for provisional measures to protect that party's rights and provides that such requests should be decided on a priority basis. This provision is similar to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and to Article 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (although they do not apply to Additional Facility cases). The requirement of priority means that in order to avoid harm to rights that are at risk, the Tribunal, once having heard the arguments of the parties, should proceed to decide on the request for provisional measures before making any other decision, even those decisions relating to jurisdiction, a position taken by many ICSID tribunals.2\n\nSee for example *SAIPEM S.p.A. v. The People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB 05/07).\n\n16.\n\nA second important part of the legal framework governing the Respondent's Request is Article 58 of the Arbitration AF Rules concerning the awarding of costs in arbitral proceedings, which provides that:\n\n\"(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.\n\n(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall form part of the award.\"\n\nThus, decisions on the award of costs are to be made at the conclusion of the proceeding, and the Tribunal has wide discretion in making such determinations. Article 58 contains no elements that would give parties at the beginning of an Additional Facility arbitration any *expectation* as to how costs will be awarded, let alone a *vested right* to payment of costs yet to be awarded.\n\n17.\n\nIn the present case, neither of the parties contests the authority of the Tribunal to make provisional orders and to make them at this time. The basic question faced by this Tribunal is whether the facts of this case justify the granting of such measures according to appropriate legal criteria.\n\n18.\n\nIt is to be noted that none of the parties was able to refer the Tribunal to a case interpreting Article 46(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules. Presumably because of the lack of such cases, they referred instead to cases interpreting Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and to Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which though not legally applicable to the present case, contain language similar to Article 46(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules. It is also to be noted that neither the Arbitration AF Rules nor the ICSID Convention and Rules specify the criteria to be followed by tribunals in deciding on provisional measures, other than to state that they are for the \"preservation of [the] rights\" of a party. In this respect the Tribunal notes that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 46(1) of the Arbitration AF Rules were drafted following Article 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Article 41 of the Statute reflected general rules of international law on provisional measures as applied by international tribunals.\n\nIn view of the above, for guidance on the criteria to be applied in deciding on requests for provisional measures, the Tribunal shall refer to the relevant jurisprudence.\n\n19.\n\nThere appears to be a consensus in jurisprudence concerning the need for the existence of certain circumstances to justify the granting of provisional orders. For example, in the ICSID case of *Occidental Petroleum Corporation - Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. the Republic of Ecuador*, the tribunal stated:\n\n\"It is also well established that provisional measures should only be granted in situations of necessity and urgency in order to protect rights that could, absent such measures, be definitely lost. It is not contested that provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not be recommended lightly. In other words, the circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party's rights and where the need is urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm.\"3\n\nPara. 59, Decision on Provisional Measures, August 17, 2007, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation - Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. the Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB /06/11).\n\n20.\n\nThus, two factors must be present to justify the granting of provisional measures: i) the measures must be necessary to preserve a party's rights and; ii) the need for such measures must be urgent to avoid irreparable harm. Relevant jurisprudence makes clear that provisional measures proceed from situations of necessity and urgency to protect rights, not mere expectations, and to avoid an irreparable harm, not merely to give convenience to one of the parties. The stringency of these basic requirements explains the extreme caution that should guide the Tribunal on this matter. In effect, only a situation of real and imminent risk to the rights of the parties justifies acceding to such request or ordering provisional measures on its own initiative.\n\n21.\n\nProvisional measures are intended to preserve parties' rights, not to protect their mere expectations. The reason for the need for restraint and caution in this area is that the imposition of a provisional measure in many circumstances may have the effect of inhibiting a party's access to justice and may result in prejudging matters of rights and obligations that are at the core of the case to be heard by a tribunal and should be decided in a final award.\n\n22.\n\nOf closest relevance to the present case is the ICSID case of *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. the Kingdom of Spain*4 in which the Respondent requested provisional measures from the tribunal that would have required the Claimant to establish a guarantee for the amount of costs that Spain could incur in defending itself. The tribunal denied the request for provisional measures presented by Spain, stating that granting provisional measures with the intention of protecting mere expectations of success on the part of the Respondent would imply a prejudgement on the cause of the Claimant.\n\n*Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. the Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/07).\n\n**C. ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT CASE**\n-----------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nAfter careful analysis of the facts of the present case, the Tribunal considers that no circumstances exist to justify a decision to order the provisional measures requested by the Respondent. In essence, the Tribunal does not find that the facts presented by the Respondent constitute an urgent situation that risks irreparable harm to the Respondent's rights. Indeed, at this point in the proceeding, the Respondent has not proven the existence of any rights whose preservation requires the requested provisional measures. As of today, the Respondent has only a mere expectation, not a right with respect to an eventual award of costs.\n\n24.\n\nIn the present case, the fact that the Claimants consist of a number of persons; the fact that there is no information about them, except for the essential data they provided to register their case at ICSID; the fact that they are individual Canadian nationals living in different parts of a federation and therefore may be subject to different judicial systems; the fact that some of the Claimants are heirs or beneficiaries of those who originally engaged in certain financial operations in Costa Rica (their status as \"investors\" under the BIT has yet to be determined); the fact that the Claimants took up a collection to pay the administrative expenses of their case; and the fact that the fees of their legal counsel were agreed on a contingency basis, may indeed be considered unusual when compared to many, if not most ICSID cases, as the Respondent, argued. However, the alleged unusual nature of these facts does not *per se* create a risk situation that would make it imperative to order provisional measures to protect the Respondent's rights. Not only does the Respondent fail to identify an imminent risk that would justify the exceptional measures requested, but it has also failed to demonstrate the existence of any of its rights that are in jeopardy of irreparable harm.\n\n25.\n\nIn effect, for the Tribunal to accept the existence of the hypothetical case of non-payment by the Claimants of the costs that might be awarded to the Respondent in this ICSID proceeding and thus to order the requested provisional measures would constitute a prejudgment by the Tribunal of underlying rights and obligations in a case which it has not yet heard. Proceeding in such manner would constitute a denial of justice to the Claimants. Moreover, even if the Tribunal were ultimately to decide this case in favor of the Respondent, such a decision would by no means necessarily result in an award to the Respondent of any ICSID costs.\n\n26.\n\nAt this point in the proceeding, the Respondent cannot be considered to be the holder of a legal right, but only the bearer of a mere expectation, which could hardly be the object of a guarantee or of protection by means of provisional measures. In short, the Tribunal has no basis for presuming future willful non-payment by the Claimants or for assuming their eventual economic incapacity.\n\n27.\n\nAs indicated above, the jurisprudence on this question invites tribunals to exercise extreme caution when deciding on whether or not to order provisional measures, and to strike an appropriate balance between the imperatives of preserving the rights of the parties that could be at risk and the risk of ordering preventive measures without adequate justification, that might nullify or restrict a party's right of access to justice. In this case, the Tribunal finds that Respondent's rights are not at risk and that the imposition of the proposed provisional measures could become an unjustifiable obstacle to the right of the parties to have access to justice.\n\n28.\n\nTaking into consideration the foregoing, the Tribunal hereby rejects the Respondent's Request for the Provisional Measures of a bank guarantee or escrow account to secure the payment of costs that this Tribunal might award to the Respondent at the conclusion of this case.\n\n29.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal also denies the Respondent's request that the Tribunal order the Claimants to agree to be held joint and severally liable for the payment of any costs awarded to the Respondent in the present case. In this case, such request is not in the nature of a provisional measure to preserve existing rights. Rather, any decision of the Tribunal in this respect might constitute a prejudgement on the responsibility of the individual parties, especially taking into consideration that the Tribunal has not even heard substantive arguments on this vital question. At this early stage of the present case, it is impossible for this or any other Tribunal to determine if any or all of the parties are subject to specific legal obligations and, if such obligations do exist, how they each are to share responsibility. Moreover, at this stage the Tribunal can say nothing at all about the relationship among the 135 different persons who chose to present a single ICSID request. The Tribunal does not know for example, if it is dealing with an active, mandatory or optional *litis consortium* ; if the 135 Claimants have some contractual relationship among them; or if they assumed some reciprocal commitments with respect this proceeding.\n\n**V.** Decision Of The Tribunal\n-------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal hereby denies each and every request advanced in the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2010-05-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe procedural background of this proceeding has been long and somewhat convoluted and therefore will only be summarized in its essence.\n\n2.\n\nOn May 10, 2004, a large number of individuals and companies from several different nationalities submitted a single Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\") to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") against the Republic of Costa Rica (\"the Respondent\" or \"Costa Rica\"), alleging violations of their rights under at least ten different bilateral investment treaties. The Request included an application for approval by the ICSID Secretary-General of access to the Additional Facility (AF) under Article 4 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. Upon receipt of the Request, the Centre requested additional information and sought clarifications regarding a series of errors and defects contained in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nUltimately, on March 27, 2007, after significant revisions, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration, as amended and supplemented1, by one hundred thirty seven (137) individual nationals of Canada (hereinafter \"the Claimants,\" as listed in Appendix A to the present Award) against the Republic of Costa Rica, pursuant to Article 4(2) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (the \"Arbitration (AF) Rules\"). On the same day, the Secretary-General dispatched the Notice of Registration to the parties and transmitted a copy of the Request for Arbitration and its supplemental letters to the Republic of Costa Rica. The Centre invited the Claimants to submit additional copies of the Request for Arbitration, reflecting the amendments and clarifications made subsequent to May 10, 2004. The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3 with the formal heading of *Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica.*\n\nBy Claimants\u2019 letters of May 11, June 4, July 9, July 23, December 3 and December 23, 2004; January 13, January 26, February 16, March 18, April 18, July 26, August 5, September 13, September 30, October 20, 2005; and January 16, February 22, November 29 and December 18, 2006.\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to Article 5(e) of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Secretary-General invited the parties to proceed as soon as possible to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal. The Claimants appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, an American national, as arbitrator, and the Respondent appointed Professor Professor Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa, a national of Argentina, as arbitrator. Pursuant to Articles 6 and 10 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Dr. Sandra Morelli Rico, a Colombian national, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of May 2, 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that, in accordance with Article 13(1) of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceeding to have begun on that date. On the same date, the parties were also informed that Ms. Natali Sequeira would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. A first session was subsequently scheduled between the Tribunal and the parties to discuss preliminary procedural matters.\n\n6.\n\nIn response to the Secretary-General\u2019s request dated March 27, 2007, the Claimants filed on May 14, 2008 a Revised Request for Arbitration reflecting the amendments and clarifications to their original Request for Arbitration, along with various supporting documents.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 27, 2008, the Tribunal held its first session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session, the parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with Articles 6 and 13 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect. During the session the parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. In particular, these matters concerned: i) the applicable arbitration rules for the proceeding; ii) the representation of the parties; iii) the apportionment of the procedural costs and the advance payments to the Centre; iv) the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal; v) the place of arbitration; vi) the procedural languages; vii) the records of the hearings; viii) the means of communication and copies of the instruments; ix) the presence and quorum for meetings of the Tribunal; x) the decisions of the Tribunal by correspondence or any other form of communication; xi) the delegation of power to set time limits and sign procedural orders on behalf of the Tribunal; xii) the phases of the proceeding (written and oral); xiii) number, sequence and schedule of written pleadings; xiv) the production of evidence and witnesses\u2019 testimony (written and oral); xv) dates and nature of subsequent sessions; and xvi) publication of the award and the decisions related to the proceeding.\n\n8.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties agreed that since the Respondent intended to raise jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal would deal with the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary matter. The schedule of pleadings on jurisdictional objections was agreed as follows: Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction: September 26, 2008; Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction: December 23, 2008; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction: 27 February 2009; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction: April 27, 2009. In addition, the parties proposed that the Hearing on Jurisdiction be held between August 3 and 7, 2009.\n\n9.\n\nDuring the course of the first session, the counsel for the Respondent, Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, expressed the Respondent\u2019s intention to submit a request for provisional measures on costs. On this point, the President stated that in the event such request was formally submitted it would be dealt with pursuant to Article 46 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules and it would determine the schedule for the other party to submit observations. On July 8, 2008 the Respondent filed a Request for Provisional measures whereby it requested that: i) the Tribunal order the Claimants to post a bank guarantee (or an escrow account deposit administered by ICSID) equivalent to the ICSID administrative fees that the Respondent might incur during the course of the proceedings on jurisdiction; and ii) that the Tribunal order Claimants to represent that they agree to be held jointly and severally liable for any amounts that the Tribunal may award to cover Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses. The Claimants\u2019 submitted their observations on the Request for Provisional Measures on August 6, 2008. The Tribunal issued a Decision on Provisional Measures on November 5, 2008. The Tribunal concluded that i) the facts presented by the Respondent did not constitute an urgent situation that risked irreparable harm to the Respondent\u2019s rights; ii) the Respondent had only a mere expectation and not a right with respect to an eventual award of costs; iii) the request to order the Claimants to be held joint and severally liable for the payment of any costs eventually awarded to the Respondent is not in the nature of a provisional measure to preserve existing rights; and iv) a Tribunal\u2019s decision in this respect might constitute a prejudgment on the responsibility of individual parties. Therefore, pursuant to Article 46 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Tribunal denied Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n10.\n\nAs agreed during the first session, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility on September 26, 2008. By letter of December 18, 2008, the parties agreed to an extension for the filing of the Claimants Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. According to the revised schedule, the subsequent jurisdictional pleadings were submitted as follows: Claimants Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, on January 13, 2009; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, on April 10, 2009, and the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on June 10, 2009. By letters of June 8, 2009 the parties agreed to a five day extension for the presentation of the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, which was submitted on June 15, 2009.\n\n11.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held as scheduled, from August 3 through August 6, 2009, at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. Messrs. Robert Wisner and W. Brad Hanna of the law firm McMillan LLP and Natacha Leclerc of the law firm Cain Lamarre Casgrain Wells s.e.n.c.r.l., were present at the hearing on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Stanimir Alexandrov, Patricio Gran\u00e9, Marinn F. Carlson, and Joshua Robbins of Sidley Austin LLP; Messrs. Esteban Ag\u00fcero Guier, M\u00f3nica Fern\u00e1ndez Fonseca, Luis Adolfo Fern\u00e1ndez and Jos\u00e9 Carlos Quirce of the Costa Rican Government as well as Mr. Alan Thompson Chac\u00f3n, Respondent\u2019s legal expert, were present at the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. During the hearing the Tribunal heard the oral examination of the following Claimants\u2019 witnesses: Messrs. Patricia Lucie Fleming, Maurice Wilfrid Laframboise, Norman Albert Barr, and Charles Bergeron, all of whom were also Claimants in this proceeding. The following Respondent\u2019s witnesses were also examined: Messrs. Sandra Castro Mora, Walter Espinoza, Elizabeth Flores Calvo and Marietta Herrera Cantillo, all of whom were officials of different Costa Rican state agencies and powers.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the presence in the hearing room of those Claimants who were to appear also as witnesses prior to providing their oral testimony, on the grounds that Article 3 9(2)2 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules referred to the attendance of witnesses only during their testimony, unless otherwise agreed by the parties3. The Claimants\u2019 counsel strongly objected to the exclusion of any Claimant from the hearing room. They argued that Article 39(2) Arbitration (AF) Rules explicitly gives parties the right to attend the hearing and that a party does not lose its rights simply by being a witness. Moreover, the Claimants argued that to deny a party the right to be present at a hearing in which his or her rights were at stake and to assist counsel in presenting that party\u2019s case would constitute a denial of due process.\n\nArticle 39(2) of the Arbitration (AF) Rules provides: \"(2) Unless either party objects, the Tribunal, after consultation with the Secretary-General, may allow other persons, besides the parties, their agents, counsel and advocates, witnesses and experts during their *testimony,* and officers of the Tribunal, to attend or observe all or part of the hearings, subject to appropriate logistical arrangements. The Tribunal shall for such cases establish procedures for the protection of proprietary or privileged information.\" [emphasis added]\n\nThe Respondent had initially raised this objection by letter of July 29, 2009 addressed to the Tribunal, in which it stated that the presence in the hearing room of the Claimants who were also witnesses, would allow them to listen to the testimony of any preceding Respondent\u2019s witnesses with the result of possibly influencing their own testimony. That circumstance would give the Claimants an unfair advantage with respect to the Respondent whose witnesses would not have a similar opportunity. Thus, according to the Respondent, to allow the Claimant-witnesses to be present in the hearing prior to their testimony would be contrary to the principles of due process and equality of treatment of the parties. The Respondent had no objection to the presence at the hearing of the other Claimants, who would not be called as witnesses. By letter of July 30, 2009 the Claimants stated that it would be a fundamental violation of Claimants\u2019 rights to due process denying them the right to be present, since it is a widely accepted principle in arbitration that an arbitral tribunal may not exclude a party who wishes to be present from any hearing. In the Claimants\u2019 view, Article 39(1) of the Arbitration (AF) Rules grants the party an absolute right to be present at the hearing, while Article 39(2) only addresses the need for both parties to consent before the hearing is opened to non-parties. Finally, according to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s concerns about inequality are not substantiated as Respondent would also have representatives present throughout the hearing to instruct counsel. Therefore Claimants requested the Tribunal to deny Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n13.\n\nOn that point, the Tribunal decided by majority to allow those Claimants who were to testify as witnesses to attend the entire hearing on jurisdiction. Thereafter, the parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed that the four Claimants scheduled to testify as witnesses would remain in the hearing room until Respondent\u2019s witnesses had offered their testimony. When the time came for the four Claimants to testify, they were to leave the hearing room, and each testifying Claimant would then be permitted to stay in the hearing room only after that Claimant had testified4.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, August 4, 2009, pp. 371-72.\n\n14.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction proceeded to its conclusion on the basis of this agreement. Costa Rica\u2019s witnesses namely, Ms. Marietta Cantillo, Mr. Walter Espinosa and Ms. Sandra Castro Mora testified and were cross-examined. Thereafter Claimants Wilfrid Laframboise, Patricia Lucie Fleming, Maurice Norman Albert Barr, and Charles Bergeron testified and were cross-examined.\n\n**II. The Facts of This Case**\n------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThis dispute concerns the situation in which the Claimants, 137 individual nationals of Canada, assert separate and distinct claims against Costa Rica for injuries to their alleged individual investments as a result of various breaches of domestic and international law, in particular the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica and the Government of Canada for the Protection and Promotion of Investment, signed on March 18, 1998, in force since September 29, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as \"the BIT\" or \"the Canada-Costa Rica BIT\"). Costa Rica is a Contracting Party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, signed in Washington in 1965 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). As Canada is not a Party to the ICSID Convention, Schedule C of the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings (hereinafter referred to as \"Additional Facility,\") shall apply as provided by Article XII 4(b) of the BIT.5\n\nArticle XII(4) provides that *\"The dispute may be submitted to arbitration under... (b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, if either the disputing Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the investor, but not both, is a Party to the ICSID Convention;...\"*\n\n16.\n\nIn particular, Claimants alleged that Costa Rica, by failing to provide proper vigilance and governmental regulatory supervision over the national financial system, had injured their investments in violation of the BIT provisions regarding full protection and security, fair and equitable treatment, due process of law, and protection against expropriation.\n\n17.\n\nLuis Enrique Villalobos Camacho and his brother Osvaldo Villalobos Camacho (hereinafter the \"Villalobos brothers\" or the \"brothers\") at the time of the incidents giving rise to this case were Costa Rican nationals engaged in various business activities in Costa Rica. In particular, they owned and operated a currency exchange, known first as Casa de Cambio Hermanos Villalobos (\"the Villallobos Brothers Money Exchange\") and later renamed Casa de Cambio Ofinter S.A. (\"Ofinter\"). From at least 1998 until Ofinter\u2019s collapse in 2002, the *Superintendencia General de Entidades Financieras* (SUGEF), the Costa Rican governmental financial regulatory agency under the supervision of the Central Bank of Costa Rica, had licensed Ofinter to engage in the money exchange business and regularly included it in the list of authorized money exchanges, which it published periodically for purposes of informing the public. Ofinter had offices in downtown San Jose, the capital city of Costa Rica, and in the San Pedro Mall.\n\n18.\n\nSometime prior to 1996, the Villalobos brothers developed and instituted a scheme whereby individuals and companies would place funds with the brothers in return for a high interest rate on their deposits, as well as the repayment of the principal amount under stipulated conditions. The office in which these transactions were carried out was located in the San Pedro Mall, adjacent to Ofinter\u2019s money exchange business, with a separate entrance from the money exchange business. The Villalobos brothers did not openly undertake a public solicitation of funds, nor did they explain to their clients how they would use the funds raised. Instead, they conducted this part of their business on a highly confidential basis and would accept contributions only from persons introduced to them through recommendations from acquaintances.\n\n19.\n\nIndividuals or companies placing funds in the scheme were required to make an initial minimum payment of US$10,000. The minimum period of deposit for amounts up to US$99,000 was six months and twelve months for deposits of more than US$100,000. Interest was credited monthly to depositors\u2019 accounts and they were entitled to withdraw interest on a monthly basis. In order to withdraw three or more months\u2019 worth of interest, a depositor had to provide the brothers at least a two-week written notice. All withdrawals of principal required at least one month\u2019s written notice. The Villalobos brothers promised to pay those depositing funds with them a minimum of 3% per month or a total of 36% interest per year. Some persons withdrew their interest regularly when paid and others left the interest to accumulate in their accounts with the brothers. Depositors who were willing to forego monthly withdrawals were promised a rate of 2.8% per month, compounded, which was equivalent to an annual interest rate of 39.29%.\n\n20.\n\nAlthough Claimants argued that the deposits made with the Villalobos constituted a form of participation in an enterprise according to Article I(g)ii of the BIT, evidence on the record shows that deposits with the Villalobos brothers under the above scheme were structured as personal loans to Luis Enrique Villalobos6. After filling out a deposit form, depositors made payments of their deposits in one of three ways: 1) in cash delivered to a Villalobos brother or a Villalobos employee at the office in the San Pedro Mall; 2) by check, usually made out to Luis Enrique Villalobos, to Ofinter, to their brokerage account, or to another of their related entities; or 3) by wire transfer to one of their bank accounts in Costa Rica, the United States, or another country.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para. 36: *\"Claimants do not dispute that the guarantee cheques and the documents accompanying the Beneficiary Statement establish that Enrique Villalobos was personally liable for payment of the principal advanced along with the interest set out on the cheque. In this sense, the investments were personal loans evidenced by a promissory note or debenture issued by the principal shareholder of Ofinter and its related companies. \"*\n\n21.\n\nIn return, as evidence of the transaction and as a receipt of the depositors\u2019 funds, the Villalobos brothers or an employee delivered to each depositor what some Claimants referred to as a \"guarantee check\" drawn on an account in the name of Luis Enrique Villalobos at the *Banco Nacional de Costa Rica* in the amount of the deposit made with the brothers. The checks were undated and the deposit form filled out by the depositors explained that the check was issued by Luis Enrique Villalobos, a physical person, responsible for the amount shown on the check. At same time, the Villalobos employee receiving the deposit made clear that the checks were not to be cashed and that the account on which they were drawn did not have sufficient funds to pay the amount indicated on the check. In fact, the account on which they were drawn remained inactive after 1997 and never had more than US$5,000. Often on the back of the check, a Villalobos employee would write information concerning the interest to be paid on the deposit. If a depositor wished to withdraw principal, he or she would present the guarantee check when requesting payment and surrender it upon payment.\n\n22.\n\nDrawn by the high interest rates and the confidential nature of the scheme, more than 6,200 persons deposited a total of approximately US$405 million with the Villalobos brothers over the years of the scheme\u2019s operation. Many of the depositors, like the Claimants in this case, were foreign nationals. They often deposited significant sums of money with what appears to be relatively little investigation and research, relying instead on the recommendations of friends and acquaintances who had previously deposited funds with the brothers and attested to the fact that the Villalobos brothers had regularly paid them the high interest rates promised. The Villalobos brothers provided minimal documentation to the persons depositing funds with them, and thereafter issued no periodic reports on the status of the funds received or the enterprises in which the funds were purportedly invested. Moreover, the Villalobos brothers made no reports to the tax or other governmental authorities of Costa Rica or any other government on their operations or on the income earned by depositors in the scheme.\n\n23.\n\nIt appears that agencies of the Costa Rican government inspected the Villallobos currency exchange operation from time to time. It also appears that such agencies came to suspect that the Villalobos brothers were conducting other unauthorized activities in connection with the currency exchange. Although the authorities pursued such leads, they were unable to gather sufficient evidence to prove wrongdoing. One of the problems they encountered was that the depositors themselves refused to cooperate by revealing to the authorities the nature of their business transactions with the Villalobos brothers.\n\n24.\n\nOn June 5, 2002, the Costa Rican judicial authorities received a request for cooperation and legal assistance from the Department of Justice of Canada, which suspected that a criminal organization in Canada was using the Villalobos brothers scheme to launder money obtained from criminal activities. Pursuant to this request, Costa Rican law enforcement officials, having obtained a search warrant, raided the Villalobos offices and seized various documents and other items on July 4 and 5, 2002. The operation in the San Pedro Mall was closed as a result, but the Villalobos brothers moved their deposit business to another location in the same shopping mall, where despite public knowledge of the raid, certain persons, including the Claimant Norman Barr, continued to deposit funds with the brothers. After the raid, the Villalobos brothers issued other types of instruments to depositors instead of the so-called \"guarantee checks\" previously provided.\n\n25.\n\nThe Costa Rican government\u2019s investigation after the raid revealed that the Villalobos brothers had been engaged in illegal financial intermediation and had operated a fraudulent Ponzi scheme whereby persons were induced to invest in the scheme by promises of a high return. Interest payments were financed not from the investment of such funds but from subsequent deposits by other persons. On November 27, 2002, the Costa Rican authorities ordered the arrest of the brothers, closed Ofinter, and seized the assets and accounts of the Villalobos brothers and their affiliated enterprises. On December 18, 2002, the Central Bank of Costa Rica formally cancelled Ofinter\u2019s authorization to operate a currency exchange.\n\n26.\n\nAlthough Osvaldo Villalobos Camacho was arrested and prosecuted for fraud and illegal financial intermediation, his brother Enrique Villalobos managed to escape capture and still remains a fugitive from justice at this time. Ultimately after a lengthy trial involving many witnesses and voluminous documentation, on May 16, 2007 the Trial Court of the First Circuit of San Jos\u00e9 found Osvaldo Villalobos Camacho guilty of aggravated fraud and illegal financial intermediation for his participation in operating the brothers\u2019 financial scheme. The Trial Court sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment for his criminal conduct.7 In their lengthy decision, the judges of the Trial Court concluded that the Villalobos brothers had put in place and operated a Ponzi scheme in which they had used funds received from depositors to pay other depositors and themselves, rather than to invest the funds so as to secure a return for use in paying investors. The judges noted that the brothers\u2019 scheme was cloaked in secrecy and was designed to avoid notice by the public or detection by the governmental authorities. On June 2, 2008, a decision of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica upheld the conviction and prison sentence of Osvaldo Villalobos.8\n\nDecision of the Trial Court of the First Circuit of San Jos\u00e9 No. 435-07, May 16, 2007 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-8).\n\nDecision of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica, June 2, 2008 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-84)\n\n27.\n\nSince the clients who had provided funds to the brothers were considered victims of fraud, they were permitted under Costa Rican law to file a civil complaint for compensation in connection with the criminal case against Osvaldo Villalobos. At the Hearing on Jurisdiction in the present arbitration proceeding, the auxiliary attorney general of Costa Rica, who was the prosecutor in charge of the criminal prosecution against Osvaldo Villalobos, testified that only 300 persons chose to avail themselves of this procedure.9 It is not clear whether the reason for this limited participation was the desire of most depositors to avoid the scrutiny of governmental and tax authorities or their belief that such participation would be futile in terms of actually securing a repayment of the funds that they had deposited with the brothers. As with the collapse of any Ponzi scheme, relatively few assets remained under the control of the court to satisfy even this relatively small number of claimants who participated in the criminal proceeding.\n\nTestimony of Walter Espinoza, Hearing Transcript, August 4, 2009, at page 382 line 3.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants, considering that they have lost their deposits with the Villalbos brothers, commenced this arbitration against the Costa Rican government for compensation for their loss on the grounds that such loss had been caused by various actions or omissions of the government of Costa Rica in violation of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT.\n\n**III. Respondent\u2019s Objections To Jurisdiction And Admissibility**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration, the Respondent contends that ICSID and this Tribunal lack jurisdiction to hear this dispute. In support of its position, the Respondent advances five distinct jurisdictional objections, as well as an admissibility objection to Claimants\u2019 claim on expropriation.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection is that none of the deposits made by the Claimants with the Villalobos brothers constitute an \"investment\", as that term is defined in Article I of the BIT. Therefore, the Claimants are not entitled to seek the protection of the BIT for the funds that they have allegedly lost as a result of their participation in the Villalobos scheme since a tribunal under Article XII of the BIT only has jurisdiction to hear disputes concerning \"investments.\"\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second jurisdictional objection is that certain of the Claimants are not \"investors\" for purposes of Article 1(h) of the BIT, which grants standing to bring a claim against a BIT contracting state only to persons who are investors.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s third jurisdictional objection is that the Claimants\u2019 claims arising out of the search and seizure of Villalobos assets by Costa Rica, which Claimants allege constituted an unlawful expropriation and denial of due process, are barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT which provides that a Canadian investor may submit a claim against Costa Rica only if \"no judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be a breach of this agreement.\" Respondent contends that Costa Rican Courts have authorized and subsequently ratified the seizure of the Villalobos assets by the authorities of that country.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s fourth jurisdictional objection is that the majority of the claims in this case are untimely and therefore barred by either Article XII(3)(c) or Article XV of the BIT.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s fifth and final jurisdictional objection is that any claims of the Claimants based on alleged violations of international agreements other than the BIT or of Costa Rican law are not covered by the BIT and its dispute settlement provisions.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent also alleges that the Claimants\u2019 claims of expropriation are inadmissible and premature since the necessary procedural requirements have not been fulfilled.\n\n**IV. Claimants\u2019 Opposition to Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nClaimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the present case on the basis that jurisdiction has to be determined on a *prima facie* standard and issues of admissibility should not be decided as a preliminary matter.\n\n37.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s main objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, arguing: (i) that they made an investment under Article I (g) of the BIT; (ii) that they are \"investors\" under Article 1(h) of the BIT; (iii) that all claims are timely and complied with any necessary procedures under the BIT and (iv) that their claims are not barred by the procedural requirement of Article XII (3)(d) of the BIT.10\n\nArticle XII(3) of the BIT provides that *\"An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:... (d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement...*\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the funds provided to the Villalobos brothers are \"investments\" as they fall within the examples listed in Article I (g)(i)(vi) of the BIT and they meet the general definition of \"investments\" provided by that same Article I. They also argue that the said funds are not within the exceptions listed in Article 1(g). They affirm that their investments were made in accordance with Costa Rican law and within the territory of Costa Rica.\n\n39.\n\nIn reference to objections *ratione personae,* Claimants argue that all Claimants are Canadian nationals, some of whom invested in Costa Rica indirectly through non-Canadian holding companies owned and controlled by them. They also maintain that Canadian successors of deceased investors have standing as investors under the BIT, and they assert no claims on behalf of prospective investors.\n\n40.\n\nConcerning objections *ratione temporis,* Claimants considered that none of their claims are barred by Article XV which provides that \"This Agreement shall apply to any investment made by an investor of one contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party before or after the entry into force of this Agreement...\"\n\n41.\n\nThey also maintain that all of their claims were submitted within the limitation period provided by Article XII(3) and that all Claimants filed the notices required under Article XII(2) of the BIT. Claimants also argued that Article XII(2) is procedural in nature and not jurisdictional. They assert that obligations under Article XII (2) and Article XII (3) are independent.\n\n42.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that their expropriation claims are admissible on the basis that at the time of submitting their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, six and a half years had elapsed since Costa Rican authorities seized the assets of the Villalobos brothers without making these assets available to satisfy the claims of their creditors, including those of the Claimants. Claimants who participated in criminal proceedings against Osvaldo Villalobos have been unable to collect any of the seized assets. Thus, Claimants argue that the exhaustion of Costa Rican legal proceedings by those Claimants who did not participate in such criminal proceedings would be futile.\n\n**V. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis And Conclusions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nAt the outset, it should be noted that each of the five jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent would, if established, have differing potential effects on this case. A finding by the Tribunal in support of the first jurisdictional objection would constitute a complete bar to the entire case advanced by all 137 Claimants, since each of them must establish that they have an \"investment\", as that term is defined by the BIT, in order to bring an arbitration against Costa Rica. On the other hand, a finding by this Tribunal in support of any or all of the other four jurisdictional objections would have the result that this Tribunal would lack jurisdiction only with respect to certain Claimants or certain issues that they advance. In view of the importance and all-encompassing nature of the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal will address that objection first.\n\n44.\n\nFor the Tribunal to have jurisdiction in this case, each of the Claimants, under Article XII(2) has the burden to demonstrate, *inter alia* that he or she is \"an investor\" as defined in Article 1(h) of the BIT. An \"investor\" under Article 1(h) of the BIT means:\n\n\"(i) any natural person possessing the citizenship of one Contracting Party who is not also a citizen or the other Contracting Party; or\n\n(ii) any enterprise as defined by paragraph (b) of this Article, incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with the applicable laws of one Contracting Party;\n\nwho owns or controls an investment made in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n45.\n\nThus, in addition to their nationality, the Canadian Claimants must demonstrate that they own or control an \"investment,\" as that term is defined in the BIT, in the territory of Costa Rica.\n\n46.\n\nArticle 1(g) of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT states: \" \u2018investment\u2019 means any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter\u2019s laws...\" It then provides that \"investment\" includes, *\"though not exclusively\",* six listed categories of assets, including (i) movable and immovable property and related property rights; (ii) shares, stocks, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in an enterprise; (iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value; (iv) goodwill; (v) intellectual property rights; and (vi) rights conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract, or exploit natural resources. Article 1(g) also stipulates that certain types of assets are not included within the meaning of investment. These include \"real estate or other property not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\" and \"claims to money that arise solely from: (i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services... ; or (ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction...\"11\n\nThe full text of Article I (g) of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT is as follows:\n\n\"(g) \"investment\" means any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\ni. movable and immovable property and any related property rights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;  \n ii. shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in an enterprise;  \n iii. money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value;  \n iv. goodwill;  \n v. intellectual property rights;  \n vi. rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources;\n\nbut does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.\n\nFor further certainty, investment does not mean, claims to money that arise solely from:\n\ni. commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national or enterprise in the territory of one Contracting Party to a national or an enterprise in the territory of the other Contracting Party; or  \n ii. the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing, where the original maturity of the loan is less than three years.\n\nWithout prejudice to subparagraph (ii) immediately above, a loan to an enterprise where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor shall be considered an investment.  \n For purposes of this Agreement, an investor shall be considered to control an investment if the investor has the power to name a majority of the board of directors or otherwise to legally direct the actions of the enterprise which owns the investment.  \n Any change in the form of an investment does not affect its character as an investment.  \n For greater clarity, returns shall be considered a component of investment. For the purpose of this Agreement, \"returns\" means all amounts yielded by an investment, as defined above, covered by this Agreement and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties, fees or other current income.\"\n\n47.\n\nThus, in order for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the Claimants must, at a minimum, establish that their deposits and resulting legal relationship with the Villalobos brothers constituted \"investments\" as the term is defined by the Canada-Costa Rica BIT. To do that, they must show that their deposits had three characteristics: 1) that the deposits constituted \"assets\" under the BIT; 2) that the Claimants owned or controlled those assets in the territory of Costa Rica in accordance with Costa Rica law; and 3) that if the deposits satisfied these two characteristics they did not fall within those categories of assets that the BIT expressly excludes from the definition of investment. Thus, in order to find that the Claimants\u2019 deposits and resulting relationships with the Villalobos brothers constituted an investment, the Tribunal at the outset must answer two basic questions in the affirmative: A) Did the Claimants\u2019 deposits and resulting legal relationships with one or both of the Villalobos brothers constitute \"assets\" within the meaning of the BIT?; and B) If so, did the Claimants own or control those assets \"in accordance with the laws of...\" Costa Rica?\n\n**A) Did the Claimants\u2019 Deposits and Resulting Legal Relationships with either or both of the Villalobos brothers constitute \"assets\" under the BIT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Canada-Costa Rica BIT does not define the meaning of the word \"asset.\" The French version of the BIT refers to *\"les avoirs de toute nature\"* and the official Spanish version refers to *\"cualquier tipo de activo.* The French word *\"avoirs\"* is usually translated into English as \"asset\" and the Spanish word \"*activo\"*\u00a0is also translated in English as asset. In English, the ordinary meaning of the word \"asset\" is \"anything of value\" or a \"valuable item that is owned.\"12 The Oxford English Dictionary defines \"asset\" as \"an item of value owned\" and Webster\u2019s Deluxe Unabridged Dictionary (2nd ed.) defines asset as \"anything owned that has exchange value\" or a \"valuable or desirable thing to have.\"13\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary (2nd ed). *Note by the Tribunal',* in the Spanish version of the Award, the definition of the Spanish word \"activo\" is provided from the *Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola 22nd ed)*\n\n*Note by the Tribunal',* in the Spanish version of the Award, the equivalent definitions are provided from the *Peque\u00f1o Larousse Ilustrado (2010).*\n\n49.\n\nOn the basis of these definitions, one can say that a Claimant\u2019s deposit of funds resulting in an obligation of Enrique Villalobos to pay interest and principal was an asset since it constituted a thing of value owned by that Claimant. As a result of transferring their funds to Villalobos, the Claimants obtained a promise from Enrique Villalobos to repay the principal amount under certain conditions and further to pay the Claimants a specific amount of interest each month. That asset, embodied in an agreement with Villalobos, promised them a specific return each month according to a pre-determined interest rate and the right to the repayment of their principal deposit upon stated conditions including notice. In fact, many of the Claimants received and withdrew periodic payments of funds from their accounts with the Villalobos brothers.\n\n50.\n\nThat being so, it is clear to the Tribunal that the obligations of Enrique Villalobos to the Claimants as a result of their deposit of funds constituted \"assets\" owned by the Claimants within the meaning of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT.\n\n**B) Did the Claimants Own and Control Their Assets In Accordance with the Laws of Costa Rica?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nUnder the BIT, not only must the Claimants demonstrate that they own the assets which they assert constitutes an investment, but they must also demonstrate that they own or control those assets in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica. The French text of the BIT requires that the investments be owned *\"en conformit\u00e9 avec les lois\"* and the Spanish version specifies that the asset must be owned *\"de acuerdo con la legislaci\u00f3n\"*\n\n52.\n\nIn interpreting the phrases \"owned or controlled\" and \"in accordance with the...laws...,\" it should first be emphasized that the BIT states this requirement in objective and categorical terms. Each Claimant must meet this requirement, regardless of his or her knowledge of the law or his or her intention to follow the law. Thus, the Claimants\u2019 statements that they intended to follow the law or that they did not know the law are irrelevant to a determination of whether they actually owned or controlled their investments in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica.\n\n53.\n\nNot all BITs contain a requirement that investments subject to treaty protection be \"made\" or \"owned\" in accordance with the law of the host country. The fact that the Contracting Parties to the Canada-Costa Rica BIT specifically included such a provision is a clear indication of the importance that they attached to the legality of investments made by investors of the other Party and their intention that their laws with respect to investments be strictly followed. The assurance of legality with respect to investment has important, indeed crucial, consequences for the public welfare and economic well-being of any country.\n\n54.\n\nIn order to prevent economic hardship to individual citizens and reduce the risk of financial crises, governments ordinarily seek to protect the savings of the public from fraud and other harms that can do significant injury not only to individuals but to the economy as a whole. They therefore seek to achieve this objective by regulating the actions of individuals and companies who would raise capital from the public or otherwise seek to serve as financial intermediaries.14 One means employed by Costa Rica to protect the public savings is the Organic Law of the Central Bank of Costa Rica,15 one of whose objectives, according to Article 2(d), is \"to promote a stable, efficient, and competitive system of financial intermediation.\" Toward this end, Article 116 of the Law provides that the only entities that may engage in financial intermediation in the country are those that are expressly authorized to do so by law. Furthermore, Article 157 makes it a crime to engage in financial intermediation without authorization.\n\nSee for example the United States Securities Act of 1933 which regulates the sale to the public of a \"security,\" which includes a wide range of financial instruments.\n\n*Ley Org\u00e1nica del Banco Central de Costa Rica No. 7558* (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit R-40).\n\n55.\n\nBy actively seeking and accepting deposits from the Claimants and several thousand other persons, the Villalobos brothers were engaged in financial intermediation without authorization by the Central Bank or any other government body as required by law. The courts of Costa Rica after a lengthy and extensive legal process determined that Osvaldo Villalobos, because of his involvement in the scheme, committed aggravated fraud and illegal financial intermediation. In securing investments from the Claimants, the Villalobos brothers were thus clearly not acting in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica. The entire transaction between the Villalobos brothers and each Claimant was illegal because it violated the Organic Law of the Central Bank. If the transaction by which the Villalobos acquired the deposit was illegal, it follows that the acquisition by each Claimant of the asset resulting from that transaction was also not in accordance with the law of Costa Rica. Although the Claimants may not have committed a crime by entering into a transaction with the Villalobos,16 the fact that they gained ownership of the asset in violation of the Organic Law of the Central Bank means that their ownership was not in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica and that therefore each of their deposits and resulting relationships with Villalobos did not constitute an \"investment\" under the BIT.\n\nCosta Rica has not prosecuted the Claimants for their participation in the Villalobos scheme. At the Jurisdictional Hearing, the auxiliary attorney general of Costa Rica, Walter Espinoza, stated; \"From our point of view, they [the Claimants] did not violate criminal law.\" Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, Tuesday, August 4, 2009, p. 430.\n\n56.\n\nClaimants\u2019 counsel argued that in judging whether the Claimants\u2019 deposits were owned in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica, this Tribunal should look only to whether the Claimants ownership rights in their claim to be paid the agreed-upon interest and principal were legal obligations under Costa Rican law. By accepting the deposits under the conditions outlined earlier in this decision, Enrique Villalobos clearly became subject to that legal obligation. However, this Tribunal believes that the approach suggested by Claimants\u2019 counsel is too narrow and not a correct interpretation of the treaty language \"owned... in accordance with the law\" of Costa Rica.\n\n57.\n\nThe ordinary dictionary meaning of the verb \"own\" is \"to have or hold a property\"17 or \"to have or possess a property.\"18 In order to determine whether the ownership of a property is in accordance with the law of a particular country, one must of necessity examine how the possession or ownership of that property was acquired and in particular whether the process by which that possession or ownership was acquired complied with all of the prevailing laws. In the present case, it is clear that that the transaction by which the Claimants obtained ownership of their assets *(i.e.* their claim to be paid interest and principal by Enrique Villalobos) did not comply with the requirements of the Organic Law of the Central Bank of Costa Rica and that therefore the Claimants did not own their investment in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica. That being the case, the obligations of the Villalobos brother held by the Claimants do not constitute \"investments\" under the Canada-Costa Rica BIT and therefore this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimants\u2019 claims against Costa Rica under the BIT.\n\nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. *Note by the Tribunal',* in the Spanish version of the Award, the definition of the Spanish word *\"poseer\"* is provided from the *Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola (22nd ed).*\n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (2nd ed.). *Note by the Tribunal',* in the Spanish version of the Award, the definition of the Spanish word *\"poseer \"* is provided from the *Peque\u00f1o Larousse Ilustrado (2010).*\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the words \"owned in accordance with the laws\" of Costa Rica reflects both sound public policy and sound investment practice. Costa Rica, indeed any country, has a fundamental interest in securing respect for its law. It clearly sought to secure that interest by requiring investments under the BIT to be owned and controlled according to law. At the same time, prudent investment practice requires that any investor exercise due diligence before committing funds to any particular investment proposal. An important element of such due diligence is for investors to assure themselves that their investments comply with the law. Such due diligence obligation is neither overly onerous nor unreasonable. Based on the evidence presented to the Tribunal, it is clear that the Claimants did not exercise the kind of due diligence that reasonable investors would have undertaken to assure themselves that their deposits with the Villalobos scheme were in accordance with the laws of Costa Rica.\n\n59.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction on the ground that the Claimants did not own or control investments in accordance with the law of Costa Rica is established and that this Tribunal is therefore without jurisdiction to hear and decide the Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n60.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Respondent\u2019s first objection to jurisdiction is established and justifies a complete dismissal of the Claimants\u2019 case, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary or appropriate to consider and decide upon the other objections to jurisdiction and admissibility raised by the Respondent.\n\n61.\n\nFor the reasons presented and pursuant to Article 45 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Tribunal decides to accept the first objection to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent, and it therefore dismisses the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration on the ground that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *\"ratione materiae\"* to hear the dispute which it presents. Therefore and pursuant to Article 44 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Tribunal declares the proceedings closed.\n\n**VI. Costs**\n-------------\n\n62.\n\nArticle 58(1) of the Arbitration (AF) Rules provides: \"Unless parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne.\" The Tribunal thus has discretion to determine the apportionment of costs between the parties. The Tribunal notes that in reference to the allocation of costs, the practice of ICSID investment arbitration differs from commercial arbitration, which tends to award costs to the successful party.19 Most ICSID tribunals have determined that each party should bear its own costs.20 In a few recent investment arbitration cases the principle that \"costs follow the event\" has been followed by tribunals, which have determined that the losing party should bear all or part of the costs of the proceeding and counsel fees.21 Such departures from the established previous trend have been justified by tribunals in light of the existence of special reasons or circumstances.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/13), Award of October 8, 2009, para. 322. See also Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules which provides: \"...the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\"\n\nSee *i.e.* *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l), Award of August 30, 2000; *Tradex Hellas S.A. (Greece) v. Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2), Award of April 29, 1999; *ADF Group v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/l), Award of January 9, 2003; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Award of July 24, 2008.\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v. the Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/05), Award of April 15, 2009.\n\n63.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal, in concluding that Claimants\u2019 claims lacked jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* based its reasoning on a strict interpretation and application of the BIT to the facts alleged by the Claimants. In evaluating the facts presented, the Tribunal has found no evidence for concluding that special circumstances exist, such as procedural misconduct, the existence of a frivolous claim, or an abuse of the BIT process or of the international investment protection regime.\n\n64.\n\nIn consequence of the above, the Tribunal, in the application of its discretionary powers conferred by Article 58(1) of the ICSID (AF) Rules concludes that there are no special circumstances that justify a departure from the accepted and rational practice that each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses and share equally in the costs and charges of the Tribunal and the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n**VII. Decision of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nFor reasons stated in the foregoing paragraphs and pursuant to Article 45 of the Arbitration (AF) Rules, the Tribunal decides with unanimity that:\n\na) the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection *ratione materiae* to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must be accepted on grounds that the deposits made by the Claimants with the Villalobos brothers did not constitute an \"investment\" as that term is defined in Article I of the Canada-Costa Rica BIT;\n\nb) the Tribunal is accordingly without jurisdiction to entertain the dispute submitted to it either in part or in whole; and\n\nc) the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration is therefore dismissed in its entirety.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal further decides that:\n\n(a) The costs of the proceedings including the fees and expenses of the Arbitrators and the Secretariat shall be shared by the Parties in equal portion; and that\n\n(b) Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses in respect of legal fees for their counsel and their respective costs for the preparation of the written and the oral proceedings.\n\n**VIII.
