PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 12 April 2017, Claimants commenced arbitration proceedings against Respondent pursuant to Article 10 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Chile on the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments dated 2 October 1991 (the \"Treaty\" or the \"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nOn 18 October 2017, the Tribunal and the Parties participated in the first procedural hearing, which took place by means of a telephone conference. During the procedural hearing, Respondent made a request for the bifurcation of these proceedings (the \"Request for Bifurcation\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, concerning the languages of the proceedings, the applicable procedural rules and the case administration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, the Parties filed simultaneous submissions in which they set out their positions with regard to the possible bifurcation of these arbitration proceedings (\"Claimants' Submission\" and \"Respondent's Submission\", respectively).\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 November 2017, the Parties and the Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment.\n\n7.\n\nThis Procedural Order deals with Respondent's Request for Bifurcation. The Tribunal first sets out Claimants' case, as currently pleaded. The summary is made only to the extent that it is relevant for purposes of the Request for Bifurcation. The Tribunal makes no findings with regard to any possible disputed facts or legal issues (**II.**). The Tribunal then presents Respondent's arguments in support of its Request for Bifurcation (**III.**), followed by Claimants' arguments in opposition (**IV.**). Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal sets out its considerations and its ultimate decision (**V.**).\n\n**II. CLAIMANTS' PLEADED CASE**\n-------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimants contend that they are the shareholders of the Chilean company *Consorcio Publicitario y Period\u00edstico S.A.* (\"CPP\"), which in the early 1970s was the owner of the Chilean newspaper *El Clar\u00edn*, a publication established in 19521 and incorporated under the name *Empresa Period\u00edstica Clar\u00edn Ltda.* (\"EPC\"). Claimants state that *El Clar\u00edn* was the most widely read newspaper in Chile in 1973 and a vocal supporter of former Chilean president, Dr. Salvador Allende, elected on 4 September 1970.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, at 8.\n\n9.\n\nClaimants submit that, in September 1973, a military *coup d'Etat* toppled the Allende government and *de facto* seized the assets of CPP and EPC. Subsequently, by means of Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975 (\"Decree No. 165\"), the military government dissolved CPP and EPC and transferred their assets to the Chilean State. Mr. Pey Casado left Chile for Spain and only returned to Chile after the reinstatement of democracy, in 1990.\n\n10.\n\nClaimants add that, following the fall of the military regime, Chile adopted a series of measures in order to make reparations for the crimes and illegal acts committed during the dictatorship, including for politically motivated takings of property. Claimants stipulate that, in September 1995, upon his return to Chile, Mr. Pey Casado made a request to the President of Chile for the restitution of the *El Clar\u00edn* assets, and subsequently filed a formal request to this effect before a civil court in Santiago. On 7 November 1997, Mr. Pey Casado and the President Allende Foundation (the \"Foundation\") commenced arbitration proceedings before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") on the basis of the Treaty.\n\n11.\n\nClaimants add that, on 8 May 2008, the ICSID tribunal constituted to hear Mr. Pey Casado's and the Foundation's claims (the \"First Tribunal\") rendered its award (the \"First Award\"). The First Tribunal ruled that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Mr. Pey Casado's and the Foundation's expropriation claim, finding that it had consummated in 1975, before the entry into force of the Treaty. The First Tribunal however upheld jurisdiction and found in favor of the claimants in respect of their claim for breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard. In this latter regard, the First Tribunal concluded that Chile had committed a denial of justice as a result of its delay in rendering a judgment on the merits in the Santiago civil court case and awarded the claimants damages.\n\n12.\n\nClaimants further submit that, on 24 July 2008, the Santiago civil court seized with Mr. Pey Casado's request for restitution rendered its judgment on the merits. The court held that Decree No. 165 was null and void *ab initio*, and that its finding to this effect was not subject to any statute of limitations. According to Claimants, the court also concluded that the seizure of the plaintiff's assets had been ineffective and that the plaintiff had remained at all times the rightful owner of the confiscated assets.\n\n13.\n\nClaimants argue that, if the First Tribunal had had before it the judgment of the Santiago civil court, it could have decided on the dispute in full knowledge of the relevant facts. However, due to Respondent's denial of justice, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation were unable to prove in the original ICSID arbitration that the transfer of property from CPP and EPC to the Chilean State was illegal.\n\n14.\n\nClaimants complain that they were not timely notified of the Santiago civil court's judgment due to machinations by the Chilean Government. *Inter alia*, they allege that Chile sought to deprive the judgment of any legal effect by filing an application with the Santiago civil court for a ruling *inaudita parte* which purported to establish that Mr. Pey Casado had abandoned his claim. Claimants argue that, due to the efforts to prevent the notification of the judgment, Mr. Pey Casado only became aware of its existence in January 2011. Claimants add that, despite Mr. Pey Casado's subsequent efforts to exercise and obtain damages for the forty-year long deprivation of the rights that had been recognized by the Santiago civil court, those efforts were systematically rejected by Respondent.\n\n15.\n\nClaimants submit that at present they have exhausted all local remedies that could have led to the recognition and enforcement of their rights.\n\n16.\n\nOn this basis, Claimants conclude:\n\n\u00ab 17. L'absence de moyens effectifs permettant \u00e0 l'investisseur d'exercer, d'affirmer et de prot\u00e9ger les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont le Tribunal de Santiago a reconnu l'existence pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente de temps, droits qui continuent \u00e0 exister, de m\u00eame que l'absence d'un rem\u00e8de \u00e0 la privation de ces droits depuis la saisie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime Pinochet le 11 Septembre 1973, constitue une violation de l'obligation d'un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable dans le cadre de l'API Chili-Espagne. La n\u00e9gation en question constitue un d\u00e9ni de justice ; en fait, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du gouvernement du Chili ont activement et intentionnellement utilis\u00e9 tous les moyens pour fermer toute voie d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'affirmation effective des droits en question.\n\n18.\n\nEn l'absence d'autres recours au Chili pour que l'investisseur puisse exercer ou r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui continuent \u00e0 exister, les obstacles que le Chili a mis en place, pour rendre effectif le constat du Tribunal de Santiago en 2008, constituent une saisie indirecte et une violation des dispositions relatives \u00e0 l'expropriation dans l'API Chili-Espagne.\u00bb2\n\n17. Claimants request that the Tribunal render an award in which:\n\n\"i. Il ordonne que l'\u00c9tat du Chili apporte un moyen effectif de mise \u00e0 disposition des investisseurs de la valeur des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le Jugement du 1er Tribunal civil de Santiago a reconnu dans la Sentence du 24 juillet 2008 en constatant la nullit\u00e9 de droit public du D\u00e9cret confiscatoire du Minist\u00e8re de l'Int\u00e9rieur n\u00b0 165 de 1975,\n\nii.

Il ordonne en l'absence de i) que l'\u00c9tat du Chili paye aux investisseurs la *full value* des droits dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9s de l'exercice de mani\u00e8re permanente, conform\u00e9ment aux principes de droit international en mati\u00e8re de dommages, dont l'estimation actuelle correspond \u00e0 celle \u00e9tablie dans le Rapport *Accuracy* le 27 juin 2014 et mise \u00e0 jour selon les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans ce Rapport, major\u00e9e du montant du dommage moral,\n\niv. Il condamne l'\u00c9tat du Chili \u00e0 supporter l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des frais de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, y compris les frais et honoraires du Membre (ou des Membres) du Tribunal arbitral, les frais de proc\u00e9dure (utilisation des installations, frais de traduction etc.), et, en cons\u00e9quence, qu'il condamne l'\u00c9tat du Chili \u00e0 rembourser, dans les 90 jours qui suivent l'envoi de la Sentence arbitrale \u00e0 intervenir, aux investisseurs les frais et co\u00fbts de proc\u00e9dure avanc\u00e9s par eux, et qu'il rembourse aux investisseurs l'ensemble des frais et honoraires des avocats, experts et autres personnes ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9es \u00e0 intervenir pour la d\u00e9fense de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, portant, en cas de non remboursement dans ce d\u00e9lai, int\u00e9r\u00eats capitalis\u00e9s trimestriellement \u00e0 un taux de 10% \u00e0 compter de la date de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir jusqu'\u00e0 complet paiement, ou \u00e0 toutes autres sommes que le Tribunal arbitral estimera justes et \u00e9quitables,\n\nv. Qu'il accorde tout autre rem\u00e8de que le Tribunal consid\u00e9rerait appropri\u00e9. \u00bb3\n\nNotice of Arbitration, at 17, 18.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, at 44.\n\n**III. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants are attempting to resubmit to this Tribunal the same dispute that has already been submitted and adjudicated by prior ICSID tribunals.\n\n19.\n\nRespondent makes a number of supplementary remarks with respect to the factual background of this case. Respondent notes that, following Mr. Pey Casado's September 1995 letter to the President of Chile, the Chilean Minister of National Assets informed him that the Chilean Government was developing a reparations program that would address requests such as his. However, at the time, the details of the program were still being finalized and requests for restitution could not be processed until such time as the program was formally enacted. Respondent argues that Claimants were unwilling to wait and so initiated the arbitration before ICSID, alleging *inter alia* the expropriation of the assets of CPP and EPC (the \"First Proceeding\").\n\n20.\n\nAccording to Respondent, part of the claim for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* that was submitted to ICSID was pending at the same time before the Santiago civil court. Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation represented before ICSID that they were carving out from their consent to ICSID arbitration the claims for the confiscation of the Goss-brand printing press that were pending before the Santiago civil court.\n\n21.\n\nRespondent adds that, in the First Proceeding, Chile raised several jurisdictional objections, including the lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over events that had occurred in the 1970s, two decades before the entry into force of the Treaty. Respondent submits that, in answer to this objection, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation put forward a continuing expropriation theory, arguing that Decree No. 165 was null and void *ab initio* as a matter of Chilean public law and that the expropriation of their investment was a continuing act that had not yet consummated and that fell under the sphere of application of the BIT.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent adds that, in July 1998, while the First Proceeding was pending, Chile enacted Law No. 19,568 which established the reparations program referenced in the letter from the Minister of National Assets to Mr. Pey Casado. Respondent submits that, in a formal letter to the Government of Chile, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation indicated that they were waiving their rights to participate in the reparations program, citing the BIT's fork-in-the-road clause. According to Respondent, other shareholders of record of *El Clar\u00edn* took part in the program and were compensated. On this basis, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation alleged before the First Tribunal that, by compensating third parties, Chile had subjected their investment to a new expropriation that contravened the provisions of the BIT.\n\n23.\n\nRespondent further submits that, in 2002, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation sought to amend their claim before the First Tribunal by requesting damages for the seizure of the Goss printing press \u2013 the claim that was then pending before the Santiago civil court.\n\n24.\n\nRespondent adds that, in May 2008, the First Award dismissed Mr. Pey Casado's and the Foundation's continuing expropriation theory, finding that the expropriation of their investment was an instantaneous act that had consummated in 1975 and that *ratione temporis* fell outside the scope of application of the BIT. The First Award found that the BIT only applied to: (i) the compensation by the Chilean Government, pursuant to the reparations program, of third parties for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* ; and (ii) the lack of a judgment on the merits by November 2002 in the Santiago civil court case. The First Tribunal held on the basis of these two events that Respondent had breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard, including the obligation not to deny justice. The First Tribunal ordered Chile to pay to the claimants the amount of USD 10,132,690.18, bearing 5% interest, compounded annually, to be calculated from 11 April 2002 until the date of the notification of the First Award.\n\n25.\n\nRespondent adds that, following the issuance of the First Award, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation attempted through various means to challenge its findings on the merits.\n\n26.\n\nIn 2008, they commenced revision proceedings, arguing that they had uncovered new evidence and requesting that the First Tribunal revise the First Award by accepting their \"continuing expropriation\" theory and awarding them USD 797 million in damages for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn.* The claimants' request was rejected on 18 November 2009 as an attempt to appeal the First Award.\n\n27.\n\nIn October 2010, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation invoked the Santiago civil court judgment and raised the continuing expropriation theory in the annulment proceedings initiated by Chile (the \"Annulment Proceeding\"). Respondent notes that, when the *ad hoc* Committee ruled that their argument and the evidence presented in support were inadmissible, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation appealed that ruling four times until the Committee sent them a \"cease and desist\" letter.\n\n28.\n\nRespondent adds that, following the annulment of the damages section of the First Award, Mr. Pey Casado, Ms. Coral Pey Grebe4 and the Foundation sought to rely upon the Santiago civil court judgment and the continuing expropriation theory in the resubmission proceeding (the \"Resubmission Proceeding\"). Respondent also contends that, in the Resubmission Proceeding, Claimants argued that Chile had attempted, in violation of the BIT, to conceal and erase the Santiago civil court judgment. In the September 2016 award (the \"Resubmission Award\"), the new tribunal (the \"Resubmission Tribunal\") dismissed this new claim for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nRespondent submitted that, in June 2013, Ms. Coral Pey Grebe joined Mr. Victor Pey Casado and the Foundation in the Resubmission Proceeding (Respondent's Submission, at 20).\n\n29.\n\nRespondent argues that, while Claimants' case on the merits is not yet entirely clear, it is nevertheless clear from the Notice of Arbitration that Claimants are repeating the same arguments that they previously invoked in the ICSID arbitration. In particular, Respondent contends that:\n\ni. Claimants are arguing for the sixth time that Decree No. 165 was null and void *ab initio*, citing the Santiago civil court judgment that they previously invoked in the Annulment and Resubmission Proceedings;\n\nii. Claimants are requesting, on the basis of the same continuing expropriation theory, that the Tribunal render an award ordering Chile to provide them with an effective means to benefit from the value of their ownership rights, which the Santiago civil court has recognized;\n\niii. Claimants' third request for relief in this arbitration is a request to be awarded the expropriation value of *El Clar\u00edn*, a claim that the First Award rejected as being outside the temporal scope of application of the BIT and that the Resubmission Award declared to have been finally adjudicated;\n\niv. the 27 June 2014 Accuracy Report referenced in Claimants' third request for relief was the expert report on damages that Claimants presented in the Resubmission Proceeding;\n\nv. Claimants' second request for relief in this arbitration is a request for the same relief that had been requested, and denied, in the First Proceeding, the Revision Proceeding and the Resubmission Proceeding; and\n\nvi. Claimants' allegations in this arbitration that Chile violated the BIT as a result of alleged irregularities in the proceedings before the local Chilean courts are the same allegations that were previously made in the Resubmission Proceeding.\n\n30.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the Resubmission Award found that Claimants' allegations relating to post-First Award events were outside the remit of the Resubmission Proceeding. However, Respondent argues that the First Award dealt with and adjudicated various issues relating to the Santiago civil court proceedings. Respondent considers that, to the extent that there was some post-First Award aspect of the local proceeding that caused new and independent harm to Claimants, Claimants should have asserted new claims on that basis in ICSID revision proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nOn the basis of the above, at this point, Respondent raises the following jurisdictional objections based on *res judicata* :5\n\nAt paragraph 33 of its Submission, Respondent explicitly reserved its right to advance additional jurisdictional objections in future submissions, including, *inter alia* : (i) that Claimants did not have an \"investment\" in Chile at the time of the BIT violations that are alleged; and (ii) that Ms. Pey Grebe and the Foundation are attempting to assert claims in connection with a Chilean court proceeding to which they were not parties.\n\n**1. Claimants are attempting to seek resolution of the same dispute that they previously submitted to ICSID**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nRespondent argues that, in breach of Article 10 of the Treaty, Claimants are seeking to re-litigate the same dispute that was previously submitted to ICSID, relating to the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* and to certain events in the Santiago civil court case.\n\n33.\n\nIn this respect, Respondent contends that Article 10 of the BIT (\"if a dispute \u2026 between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\" is \"submitted to international arbitration, it may be brought before one of the following arbitration bodies\") prevents the same dispute being submitted both to an ICSID and an UNCITRAL tribunal. In Respondent's view, the same prohibition is enshrined in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, pursuant to which \"[c]onsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy\".\n\n34.\n\nRespondent takes exception to Claimants' statement in the Notice of Arbitration that the dispute before ICSID is conceptually distinct from the dispute before this Tribunal. In this respect, Respondent argues that:\n\ni. The parties to the present dispute (Mr. Pey Casado, Ms. Pey Grebe and the Foundation) are the same as in the most recent ICSID proceeding (i.e., the Resubmission Proceeding);\n\nii. The State acts complained of in this proceeding are exactly the same as in the most recent ICSID proceeding (the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* and the alleged irregularities in the Santiago civil court proceeding);\n\niii. The BIT provisions alleged to have been breached are the same in both the ICSID and UNCITRAL proceedings (Articles 3, 4 and 5); and\n\niv. The damages claim asserted in both the ICSID and UNCITRAL proceedings are exactly the same (i.e., the amount calculated in the Accuracy Report of June 2014).\n\n35.\n\nRespondent adds that the \"property rights\" referred to by Claimants in their first request for relief are the property rights associated with *El Clar\u00edn* and the \"value\" of those rights is their expropriation value, which is being sought on the basis of the alleged nullity of Decree No. 165 \u2013 the exact same claim that was made before ICSID. Further, Claimants' reference to the \"confiscation of the investment\" in their second request for relief also unequivocally refers to the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*, which was adjudicated before ICSID. Finally, Respondent contends that Claimants' third request for relief seeks damages in the same amount as in the Resubmission Proceeding, where Claimants submitted the June 2014 Accuracy Report.\n\n**2. Claimants are seeking to challenge binding conclusions from the First Award and the Resubmission Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nRespondent adds that the Notice of Arbitration purports to re-litigate a number of binding conclusions from the First Award and the Resubmission Award, most notably the conclusion that the BIT does not apply to the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*. Respondent considers that Claimants should be prevented not only by the principle of *res judicata* to seek to re-open these claims, but also by the fact that it was their own choice to pursue a BIT claim instead of participating in the reparations program established by the Chilean Government.\n\n37.\n\nOn these bases, Respondent pleads that Claimants should be prevented from continuing their \"abusive campaign of arbitral harassment\"6 against Chile by the summary dismissal of their claims and the imposition of an appropriate penalty for \"their wanton abuse of the investment arbitration system\".7\n\nRespondent's Submission, at 41.\n\nRespondent's Submission, at 42.\n\n38.\n\nRespondent argues that its jurisdictional objections above warrant the bifurcation of these arbitral proceedings.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent considers that the Tribunal should follow the presumption established in Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules in favor of deciding objections to jurisdiction as preliminary questions.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent adds that, in any event, bifurcation should be granted when the objections raised are serious rather than frivolous, if the early resolution of the objections has the potential to save time or money, to reduce or simplify the scope of a tribunal's task, and/or to provide clarity on a key question. According to Respondent, all of these conditions are satisfied in the present case.\n\n41.\n\nFirst, Respondent considers that its objections are serious and not frivolous.\n\n42.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that bifurcation would greatly increase efficiency in the present case. If the Tribunal were to uphold any one of Respondent's objections to jurisdiction, the Parties would no longer be required to address the full spectrum of issues that would normally be addressed during a full merits proceeding, which, in this case, would be extremely numerous.\n\n43.\n\nThird, Respondent contends that bifurcation would not be inefficient, as the relationship between the present arbitration and the previous ICSID proceedings would have to be briefed by the Parties and decided by the Tribunal regardless of how the proceedings are structured. In addition, the Tribunal should not be guided solely by the fact that there is a risk that bifurcation could lengthen these proceedings, as that risk exists in all cases where a request for bifurcation is made. Respondent adds that \"given the history of this dispute, at a minimum Chile should be entitled to an opportunity to avoid yet another protracted and expensive full-fledged arbitral proceeding\".8\n\nRespondent's Submission, at 52.\n\n**IV. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nClaimants are of the view that the Request for Bifurcation should be dismissed.\n\n45.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that Respondent's objections to jurisdiction are frivolous and bifurcation would only result in an increase of the time and costs of these proceedings.\n\n46.\n\nIn this respect, Claimants contend that all the Parties to this dispute have given their unconditional consent to arbitrate: Respondent by entering into the Treaty and Claimants by giving such consent formally, in writing, upon the initiation of this arbitration.\n\n47.\n\nClaimants add that the *res judicata* triple identity test is not met.\n\n48.\n\nIn their view, there is no identity of subject matter or cause of action, as the dispute before the Tribunal is entirely distinguishable from the dispute previously submitted before ICSID.\n\n49.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that the factual background to the two disputes - the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* by the military government installed in Chile after the *coup d'Etat* - is the same. However, in their view, that background only serves as context for the series of Treaty breaches that are at issue in this arbitration, all of which post-date the entry into force of the Treaty and the notification of the First Award.\n\n50.\n\nMore precisely, Claimants argue that the jurisdiction of all prior ICSID tribunals was necessarily limited to events that occurred before the issuance of the First Award, on 8 May 2008. In particular, the First Award could not have addressed the judgment of the Santiago civil court or the events which succeeded its issuance, these being subsequent to the notification of the First Award. The First Award found that \u00ab \u00e0 la connaissance du Tribunal, la validit\u00e9 du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 165 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en cause par les juridictions internes et ce d\u00e9cret fait toujours partie de l'ordre juridique interne chilien \u00bb9 and relied upon the continued validity of Decree No. 165 as factual support for its finding that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the expropriation claim. In the Annulment Proceeding, Chile successfully demonstrated that the *ad hoc* Committee was not competent to rule on the dispute that arose upon the issuance of the Santiago civil court's judgment of 24 July 2008. In the Resubmission Proceeding, the Resubmission Tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction over any dispute between the parties having arisen after the filing of the request for arbitration on 6 November 1997. This included the Santiago civil court's finding that Decree No. 165 was null and void and any dispute between the parties that was subsequent to the rendering of this judgment.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado et Fondation \"Pr\u00e9sident Allende\" c : R\u00e9publique du Chili* (Affaire CIRDI N\u00b0ARB/98/2), Sentence, 8 mai 2008, para. 603.\n\n51.\n\nClaimants argue that, on the other hand, the dispute before this Tribunal concerns conduct that occurred after the issuance of the Santiago civil court judgment of 24 July 2008, and in particular, conduct by Respondent seeking to effectively prevent any attempt by Claimants to affirm the rights recognized in the Santiago civil court judgment. In Claimants' submission, this conduct occurred in 2010, at a time when the First Award had already been rendered, and represents a new and separate breach of the Treaty. To deny them access to an UNCITRAL tribunal for these separate breaches would be to compound the denial of justice to which they have already been subjected.\n\n52.\n\nAs further support for their contention that the dispute before this Tribunal was never heard before ICSID, Claimants refer to the Resubmission Award, which found as follows:\n\n\u00ab Le Tribunal rel\u00e8ve \u00e9galement \u00e0 ce stade qu'une partie de l'argument qui lui est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les Demanderesses dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure de nouvel examen consiste \u00e0 soutenir que les actions de la D\u00e9fenderesse, depuis la transmission de la Sentence Initiale, ont constitu\u00e9 un nouveau d\u00e9ni de justice, au titre duquel une compensation est due et peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure de nouvel examen. Le Tribunal doit rejeter cet argument purement et simplement. La raison en est non seulement que des all\u00e9gations de cette nature devraient faire l'objet d'un processus de production d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en bonne et due forme avant de pouvoir convenablement donner lieu \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision dans une proc\u00e9dure arbitrale (et elles seraient effectivement soumises \u00e0 un tel processus) ; mais aussi, tout simplement, que l'ensemble de cet argument n'entre clairement pas dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence de ce Tribunal, qui (comme cela a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9) est limit\u00e9, en vertu de l'article 52 de la Convention CIRDI et de l'article 55 du R\u00e8glement d'arbitrage du CIRDI, exclusivement au \u00ab diff\u00e9rend \u00bb ou aux parties de celui-ci qui demeurent apr\u00e8s l'annulation. Ces termes ne peuvent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s que comme une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au \u00ab diff\u00e9rend \u00bb qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 initialement soumis \u00e0 l'arbitrage, diff\u00e9rend pour lequel la date critique \u00e9tait la requ\u00eate d'arbitrage initiale des Demanderesses. Les questions qui ont surgi entre les Parties apr\u00e8s cette date \u2013 et a fortiori les questions d\u00e9coulant d'une conduite post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la Sentence \u2013 ne peuvent pas, m\u00eame avec un gros effort d'imagination, entrer dans le champ de la proc\u00e9dure de nouvel examen en vertu des dispositions cit\u00e9es ci-dessus, et le Tribunal estime qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'en dire plus sur cette question dans la pr\u00e9sente Sentence. \u00bb10\n\n*Victor Pey Casado et Fondation \"Pr\u00e9sident Allende\" c : R\u00e9publique du Chili* (Affaire CIRDI N\u00b0ARB/98/2), Sentence, 13 Septembre 2016, para. 216.\n\n53.\n\nClaimants add that, because the ICSID tribunals never ruled on the merits of their expropriation claim and merely declared to have no jurisdiction to entertain it, this should not prevent this Tribunal from hearing it.\n\n54.\n\nClaimants further submit that Respondent's *res judicata* objections cannot be upheld as there is no identity of parties between this arbitration and the prior ICSID proceedings. They note in this respect that the Resubmission Award ruled that Ms. Pey Grebe did not have standing in the Resubmission Proceeding.\n\n55.\n\nClaimants add that, because the dispute before this Tribunal is distinct from the ones adjudicated by prior ICSID tribunals, Article 10 of the Treaty allows them to choose between submitting their new dispute to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration.\n\n56.\n\nClaimants add that Respondent's reliance upon Article 10(3) of the BIT's reference to \"one of the following arbitration bodies\" is inapposite. In their view, the term \"one\" performs the function of an indefinite article, not that of a numeral. In addition, Article 10(3) cannot serve to exclude the jurisdiction of an UNCITRAL tribunal for a dispute that is conceptually distinct from the dispute previously adjudicated by an ICSID tribunal. Claimants consider that their interpretation of Article 10(3) of the Treaty is in conformity with fundamental principles of treaty interpretation established in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"VCLT\"). Claimants argue that, in contravention to these principles, Respondent purports to add to Article 10(3) of the Treaty a condition which is not stated therein and which would effectively block access to an UNCITRAL tribunal for a dispute that is distinct from the one previously adjudicated by an ICSID tribunal.\n\n57.\n\nClaimants further argue that, equally, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not assist Respondent's case. Claimants contend that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention contains a rule of interpretation of parties' consent to ICSID arbitration, but this rule can be displaced. In the case of dispute settlement provisions that offer a choice between ICSID arbitration and other dispute settlement procedures, Article 26 does not exclude an investor's right to choose a forum different from ICSID.\n\n58.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that the Request for Bifurcation should be dismissed as Respondent's jurisdictional objections are intertwined with, and cannot be heard separately from, the merits. In this respect, Claimants submit that the Santiago civil court's finding that Decree No. 165 was null and void is a central point of this arbitration and its examination touches upon both jurisdiction and the merits. Bifurcating Respondent's objections would therefore only result in an increase of the duration and costs of these proceedings.\n\n59.\n\nFor all these reasons, Claimants request that the Tribunal dismiss the Request for Bifurcation and join Respondent's objections to the merits.\n\n60.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimants propose that the Parties file their first round of memorials and then, based on their full submissions and the evidence in the record, the Tribunal decide whether or not to bifurcate.\n\n61.\n\nFinally, Claimants take exception to Respondent's allegation that these proceedings are abusive. Claimants argue that they have not sought to fabricate jurisdiction under an investment treaty, and the consent of the Parties is clearly established and governed by international law. In their view, the disputes brought before the ICSID and UNCITRAL tribunals are distinct and they are not seeking to multiply arbitral proceedings in order to increase their chances of success. Claimants add that, by filing this claim, they are not seeking to obtain a benefit that is incompatible with the investment arbitration system but only to seek a remedy for the Treaty violations that they have been subjected to.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal emphasizes that its task at this stage of the proceedings is not to decide or take any position on the procedural objections raised by Respondent. The Tribunal's task is to determine whether it would be conducive to an effective administration of these arbitral proceedings to hear Respondent's objections separately from the merits.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules creates a presumption in favor of bifurcation:\n\n\"(4) In general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. However, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and rule on such a plea in their final award.\"\n\n64.\n\nHowever, as accepted by Respondent, that presumption is not absolute. The Tribunal retains a significant degree of discretion when determining whether the efficient administration of the proceedings counsels in favor of hearing an objection to jurisdiction separately from, or joined to, the merits.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal is sensitive to the fact that the Parties to this arbitration have been on opposing sides in a number of arbitral and judicial disputes during the last twenty years. Both Parties agree and the Tribunal is keenly aware that considerable care has to be taken in order to ensure that these proceeding are administered efficiently. The history of the legal disputes between the Parties is both lengthy and complex, involves a number of interconnected rulings and the Tribunal must ascertain the precise relationship between them and their connection with the present arbitral proceedings.\n\n66.\n\nThe Parties agree and the Tribunal concurs that, in deciding whether to hear jurisdictional objections with priority or to join them to the merits, the following considerations are notably relevant: (a) whether the objections to jurisdiction are *prima facie* substantial and not frivolous; (b) whether bifurcation would result in substantial cost savings and efficiency gains and the sound administration of these proceedings; (c) whether the jurisdictional objections are closely intertwined with the merits of the case; and (d) whether bifurcation would preserve the Parties' procedural rights.\n\n67.\n\nAt this time, the Tribunal only has before it Claimants' Notice of Arbitration, which does not present with a sufficient degree of detail what Claimants' contentions in this arbitration are. Respondent accepts this and states that Claimants' \"specific claims are not entirely discernible, since they are described only in cursory and opaque terms in the UNCITRAL Notice\".11 Nevertheless, at the same time, Respondent is arguing that the substance of Claimants' claims before this Tribunal, while purporting to challenge events which post-date the First Award, is in actuality a transparent attempt to reverse legally binding conclusions of prior ICSID tribunals that settled the same dispute. Respondent adds that \"various issues relating to the [Santiago civil court proceedings] had already been submitted to the First Tribunal\"12 and that Claimants' Notice of Arbitration purports to challenge various but apparently not all \u2013 binding conclusions of prior ICSID awards. Finally, Respondent reserves the right to raise additional jurisdictional objections at a future point in these proceedings, which means that, possibly, Respondent could file a second request for bifurcation.13\n\nRespondent's Submission, at 1.\n\nRespondent's Submission, at 31.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, pursuant to Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the statement of defence or, with respect to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counterclaim.\"\n\n68.\n\nAt this initial stage of the arbitration proceedings and with the limited information before it, the Tribunal cannot make an informed decision as to whether bifurcation would assist in, or effectively hamper, the efficient conduct of this arbitration. In addition, the Tribunal is reluctant to decide on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation now, considering that any decision risks being only a partial solution if further jurisdictional objections are raised and a second request for bifurcation is filed.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that postponing a decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation until after the Parties have filed their first round of memorials would better guarantee the efficient administration of these proceedings. By that time, the Tribunal will have more information before it with regard to the substance of Claimants' claims and Respondent will have set out all of its jurisdictional objections, not just the two it has raised thus far.\n\n70.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal hereby postpones rendering a decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation until after the Parties have filed their first round of submissions. The Parties are directed to confer and agree on a calendar for their first round of memorials, bearing in mind that they are instructed to set out their complete case on both the merits and jurisdiction.\n\n71.\n\nThe Parties are to revert to the Tribunal with a proposal for such a calendar within 14 days of the notification of the present Procedural Order."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2018-06-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 12 April 2017, Claimants commenced arbitration proceedings against Respondent pursuant to Article 10 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Chile on the Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments dated 2 October 1991 (the \"Treaty\" or the \"BIT\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nOn 18 October 2017, the Tribunal and the Parties participated in the first procedural hearing, which took place by means of a telephone conference. During the procedural hearing, Respondent made a request for the bifurcation of these proceedings (the \"Request for Bifurcation\").\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, concerning the languages of the proceedings, the applicable procedural rules and the case administration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 November 2017, the Parties filed simultaneous submissions in which they set out their positions with regard to the possible bifurcation of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 November 2017, the Parties and the Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment.\n\n7.\n\nOn 29 November 2017, the Tribunal rendered Procedural Order No. 2, postponing a decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation until after the Parties had filed their first round of submissions on jurisdiction and the merits. The Tribunal justified its decision as follows:\n\n\"67. At this time, the Tribunal only has before it Claimants' Notice of Arbitration, which does not present with a sufficient degree of detail what Claimants' contentions in this arbitration are. Respondent accepts this and states that Claimants' \u2018specific claims are not entirely discernible, since they are described only in cursory and opaque terms in the UNCITRAL Notice'. Nevertheless, at the same time, Respondent is arguing that the substance of Claimants' claims before this Tribunal, while purporting to challenge events which post-date the First Award, is in actuality a transparent attempt to reverse legally binding conclusions of prior ICSID tribunals that settled the same dispute. Respondent adds that \u2018various issues relating to the [Santiago civil court proceedings] had already been submitted to the First Tribunal' and that Claimants' Notice of Arbitration purports to challenge various but apparently not all - binding conclusions of prior ICSID awards. Finally, Respondent reserves the right to raise additional jurisdictional objections at a future point in these proceedings, which means that, possibly, Respondent could file a second request for bifurcation.\n\n68.

In addition, the Tribunal is reluctant to decide on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation now, considering that any decision risks being only a partial solution if further jurisdictional objections are raised and a second request for bifurcation is filed.\" [internal citations omitted]\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal directed the Parties to agree on a procedural calendar and to set out their complete case on both the merits and jurisdiction in their submissions.\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, Claimants communicated to the Tribunal that they would file their Memorial at the latest on 6 January 2018 and argued that Respondent should file its Counter-Memorial within a 40-day deadline following receipt of the Memorial.\n\n10.\n\nOn 7 December 2017, Respondent indicated that it had no objections to Claimants' proposed deadline for the submission of the Memorial, but that it objected to the 40day deadline proposed by Claimants for the Counter-Memorial. Respondent requested that the Tribunal fix the deadline for the Counter-Memorial to 3 July 2018.\n\n11.\n\nOn 9 December 2017, the Tribunal decided that Claimants' Memorial should be filed on 6 January 2018, and that Respondent's Counter-Memorial should be filed on 21 May 2018.\n\n12.\n\nOn 6 January 2018, Claimants filed their Memorial, accompanied by exhibits, witness statement and expert reports.\n\n13.\n\nOn 21 May 2018, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial, accompanied by exhibits and expert reports.\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 May 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to update their submissions concerning the possible bifurcation of these proceedings.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 May 2018, Respondent filed its supplementary submission concerning bifurcation.\n\n16.\n\nOn 7 June 2018, Claimants filed their supplementary submission concerning bifurcation.\n\n17.\n\nThis Procedural Order deals with Respondent's Request for Bifurcation. The Tribunal first summarizes certain elements of the background of the dispute, as it now appears to result from the Parties' submissions. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and is limited to matters deemed relevant for purposes of the Request for Bifurcation. The Tribunal makes no findings with regard to any possible disputed facts or legal issues (**II.**). The Tribunal then presents Respondent's arguments in support of its Request for Bifurcation (**III.**), followed by Claimants' arguments in opposition (**IV.**). Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal sets out its considerations and its ultimate decision (**V.**).\n\n**II. THE BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. The expropriation of** ***El Clar\u00edn*** **and Chile's return to democracy**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nClaimants contend that they are the shareholders of the Chilean company *Consorcio Publicitario y Period\u00edstico S.A.* (\"CPP\"), which in the early 1970s was the owner of the Chilean newspaper *El Clar\u00edn*, a publication established in 19521 and incorporated under the name *Empresa Period\u00edstica Clar\u00edn Ltda.* (\"EPC\"). Claimants state that *El Clar\u00edn* was the most widely read newspaper in Chile in 1973 and a vocal supporter of former Chilean president, Dr. Salvador Allende, elected on 4 September 1970.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, at 8.\n\n19.\n\nIn September 1973, a military *coup d'\u00c9tat* toppled the Allende government and *de facto* seized the assets of CPP and EPC. The military government then enacted Decree Law No. 77 in which it declared unlawful, and legally dissolved, all Marxist entities, political parties and their affiliates, and transferred title of their property to the State. Subsequently, by means of Decree No. 165 of 10 February 1975 (\"Decree No. 165\"), the military government applied Decree Law No. 77 to *El Clar\u00edn.* Decree No. 165 dissolved CPP and EPC and transferred their assets to the Chilean State. Mr. Pey Casado left Chile for Spain.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing the fall of the military regime, Chile adopted a series of measures in order to make reparations for the crimes and illegal acts committed during the dictatorship, including for politically motivated takings of property. In April 1990, the newly-elected President Aylwin created \"the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission\", the purpose of which was to disclose the human rights violations under the Pinochet regime. Around the same time, the Chilean Parliament adopted a law creating a National Office for Returning Exiles.\n\n21.\n\nMr. Pey Casado returned to Chile in May 1989 and began focusing on obtaining the restitution of his properties, both his personal properties and *El Clar\u00edn* property. He successfully obtained the restitution of personal property in the Chilean courts.\n\n**2. The initiation of the ICSID arbitration and of local proceedings in the Santiago courts**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn September 1995, Mr. Pey Casado initiated judicial proceedings before the First Civil Court of Santiago against the Chilean Treasury, seeking restitution of a Goss-brand printing press that had been seized by the military authorities in 1973. Also in September 1995, Mr. Pey Casado made a request with the President of Chile for the restitution of several other *El Clar\u00edn* assets. This request was forwarded by the Chilean President to the Chilean Ministry of National Assets, who responded to Mr. Pey Casado in November 1995. According to the Ministry, a bill seeking to establish the appropriate remedy (compensation or restitution) for the expropriations during the Pinochet regime was at that time before the Chilean Parliament. The Ministry of National Assets represented that, until such time as the law was adopted, it was not possible to order the restitution of the requested assets.\n\n23.\n\nOn 3 November 1997, Mr. Pey Casado and the President Allende Foundation (the \"Foundation\") commenced arbitration proceedings against Chile before the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") on the basis of the Treaty (the \"First Arbitration\"). In these proceedings, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation invoked the seizure in February 1975 of the entirety of EPC's and CPP's rights, interests and assets. However, they carved out of the proceedings the seizure of the Goss Machine printing press.\n\n24.\n\nIn July 1998, Chile passed Law No. 19,568 which established a reparations program for the expropriations which had occurred during the Pinochet regime.\n\n25.\n\nIn June 1999, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation wrote to the Chilean Ministry of National Assets declaring that they were waiving their right to apply for reparations under Law No. 19,568. Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation referred in this respect to their submission of an arbitral dispute before ICSID and the existence of a fork-in-the-road clause in the BIT.\n\n26.\n\nIn April 2000, by means of Decision 43, the Chilean Ministry of National Assets ruled on an application filed by six individuals seeking compensation for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*. The Ministry of National Assets concluded that, under Chilean law, the genuine owners of CPP at the time of the military *coup* had been four individuals whose names appeared in the shareholder registry. By means of Decision 43, the Ministry of National Assets awarded compensation to these four individuals. Decision 43 did not mention either Mr. Pey or the Foundation.\n\n27.\n\nIn November 2002, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation submitted to the ICSID tribunal constituted to hear their claims (the \"First Tribunal\") an ancillary claim seeking damages for the seizure of the Goss printing press.\n\n28.\n\nOn 8 May 2008, the First Tribunal rendered its award (the \"First Award\"). The First Tribunal ruled that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Mr. Pey Casado's and the Foundation's expropriation claim, finding that the expropriation of their investment had consummated in 1975 upon the entry into force of Decree No. 165, and thus before the entry into force of the Treaty. The First Tribunal dismissed the claimants' continuing expropriation theory and stated that, to its knowledge, the validity of Decree No. 165 had not been successfully contested in the Chilean courts and Decree No. 165 thus remained a part of the Chilean legal order. The First Tribunal dismissed the claimants' contention that Chile's refusal to award compensation in 1995 had been part of a composite expropriatory conduct. The First Tribunal however upheld jurisdiction and found in favor of the claimants in respect of their claim for breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard. In this latter regard, the First Tribunal concluded that Chile had committed a denial of justice as a result of its delay in rendering a judgment on the merits in Mr. Pey Casado's case before the Santiago civil court, coupled with its decision to award compensation by means of Decision 43 to individuals who in the Tribunal's view were not the real owners of *El Clar\u00edn*. The First Tribunal however found that the claimants had not put forward any evidence for the damages relating to this FET breach and stated that it would proceed to an evaluation of damages based on objective elements. The First Tribunal determined that the compensation to be awarded the claimants for the FET breach would be equal to the amount that Chile had awarded to third parties under Decision No. 43.\n\n29.\n\nOn 2 June 2008, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation commenced revision proceedings against the First Award, arguing that they had uncovered new evidence and requesting that the First Tribunal revise the First Award by accepting their \"continuing expropriation\" theory and awarding them USD 797 million in damages for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*.\n\n30.\n\nOn 18 November 2009, the Revision Decision was rendered, dismissing Claimants' application for revision of the First Award as inadmissible on the grounds that it was a disguised appeal.\n\n**3. The Santiago civil court judgment of 24 July 2008 and the ensuing abandonment proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn 24 July 2008, the Santiago civil court seized with Mr. Pey Casado's request for restitution rendered its judgment on the merits. The precise extent of the court's findings is disputed by the Parties. However, it is not disputed by the Parties that the Santiago court dismissed Mr. Pey Casado's claim for restitution of the Goss printing press due to his lack of standing to sue and on account of the expiry of the applicable statute of limitations. While Claimants take issue with the courts' decision on the question of statute of limitations, they add that the Santiago court, in making its findings on *ius standi*, \"n'a donc pas pu \u00e9viter de mettre en cause le D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 165 en constatant... la nullit\u00e9 de droit public en \u00e9cartant tacitement l'exception principale du Fisc quant \u00e1 la pr\u00e9tendue validit\u00e9 du D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 165, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Etat et, par cons\u00e9quent, le droit \u00e1 agir de celui-ci\".2 Claimants consider that the judgment conclusively established that Decree No. 165 is inoperative, did not legally dissolve EPC and CPP, which continue to exist, and did not lawfully transfer title over these entities' assets to the State. For its part, Respondent argues that Mr. Pey Casado explicitly declared that it was not seeking a ruling on the Decree No. 65's nullity before the Santiago court due to the fork-in-the-road clause included in the BIT and in light of the ICSID arbitration.3 Further, Respondent is of the view that the 24 July 2008 judgment \"did not declare, or in any way recognize, the nullity of Decree No. 165\"4 and said decree remains in force to this day, as part of the administrative order of Chile.\n\nMemorial, at 109.\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 136, citing from Revision Request, 2 June 2008, at 30 (Exhibit R-0025): \"En effet, ayant choisi de faire valoir leurs droits devant un tribunal arbitral international, comme leur en donnait le droit l'API sign\u00e9 entre l'Espagne et le Chili en 1991, Monsieur Pey Casado et la Fondation ne pouvaient plus, en application de l'article 10.2 de l'API, saisir les jurisdictions chiliennes pour demander la nullit\u00e9 *ex officio* de ce D\u00e9cret\".\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 311.\n\n32.\n\nIn June 2009, the Chilean State agency representing the Chilean Treasury in court proceedings filed a request with the Santiago court for a declaration of abandonment of the proceeding by the claimant, invoking his failure to notify the judgment to the defendant for more than six months. The Santiago first instance court rejected the request in August 2009, but this decision was overturned by a court of appeals in December 2009. In the present arbitration, Claimants complain that, due to machinations by the Chilean Government, they were not notified of the Santiago court's judgment of 24 July 2008 or made aware of the abandonment proceedings. They submit that the abandonment proceedings were conducted without notice thereof being given to Mr. Pey Casado and without Mr. Pey Casado having had an opportunity to present his case. Claimants submit that Mr. Pey Casado only found out about the Santiago civil court judgment's existence in January 2011. Claimants add that, despite Mr. Pey Casado's subsequent efforts to exercise and obtain damages for the forty-year long deprivation of the rights that had been recognized by the Santiago civil court, those efforts were systematically rejected by Respondent.\n\n33.\n\nFor its part, Respondent argues that it is implausible that Claimants were not aware of the 24 July 2008 Santiago civil court judgment considering their eagerness to pursue their claims. In its view, the far more likely scenario is that Mr. Pey Casado viewed the judgment as unfavorable so decided not to move the case forward by notifying it to the defendant, as would have been required under Chilean law. Respondent adds that, in any event, following the decision of the court of appeals finding that the proceedings had been abandoned, the Santiago civil court judgment no longer has any effect under Chilean law.\n\n34.\n\nClaimants submit that they only learned of both the existence of the 24 July 2008 Santiago civil court judgment and the ensuing abandonment proceedings on 24 January 2011 and, four days later, filed an appeal against the decision finding that the proceedings had been abandoned. This appeal was dismissed by the Santiago Tribunal on 28 April 2011, and was subsequently maintained on appeal by the Court of Appeal on 31 January 2012. A subsequent effort by Mr. Pey Casado to have this latter judgment set aside was dismissed by the Chilean Supreme Court in July 2012.\n\n**4. The first annulment and the ensuing resubmission proceedings before ICSID**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nIn parallel with these developments before the Chilean courts, on 5 September 2008, Chile submitted a request for annulment of the First Award before an ICSID *ad hoc* Committee (the \"First Committee\"). On 15 October 2010, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation also submitted a claim for annulment of the First Award, arguing that the First Award had neglected provisions of the Chilean Constitution that supported the argument of Decree No. 165's nullity *ab initio*. In support of this argument, in March 2011, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation submitted a number of exhibits, including the July 2008 Santiago court judgment. On 18 April 2011, the First Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2, declaring these new documents inadmissible and directed Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation to resubmit their Rejoinder without any reference to any exhibit that had not been part of the original record of the arbitration.\n\n36.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the First Committee rendered its decision on annulment (the \"First Annulment Decision\"), partially annulling the First Award and specifically the section on damages. The First Committee found that Chile had been denied the right to be heard on the issue of damages and that the First Tribunal gave contradictory reasons for its damages findings.\n\n37.\n\nOn 1 February 2013, Chile requested that the First Committee supplement the First Annulment Decision by identifying the interest that was due by Chile to Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation on the portion of the costs that had been incurred in the First Arbitration by Mr. Pey and the Foundation.\n\n38.\n\nOn 18 June 2013, Mr. Pey Casado, the Foundation and Ms. Coral Grebe filed a request for resubmission with ICSID (the \"Resubmission Proceedings\"). Claimants appointed Mr. Philippe Sands and Respondent appointed Mr. Alexis Mourre as party-nominated arbitrators. On 18 December 2013, Chile requested the disqualification of Prof. Sands, who then resigned. Claimants then appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder as replacement arbitrator. On 24 December 2013, Mr. Franklin Berman was appointed as president by the Chairman of ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n39.\n\nOn 11 September 2013, the First Committee issued its Supplementary Decision, identifying the amount of interest due.5\n\nRespondent submits that it has paid both the portion of the costs that it was ordered to pay by the First Tribunal and the interest on this amount that was determined by the First Committee (Counter-Memorial, at 168).\n\n40.\n\nIn the Resubmission Proceedings, Claimants argued that Respondent had committed a denial of justice by concealing the existence of the 24 July 2008 Santiago Civil Court judgment and requested compensation for the expropriation of their assets, which had occurred in 1973.\n\n41.\n\nOn 13 September 2016, the Resubmission Award was issued by the Resubmission Tribunal. The Resubmission Tribunal concluded that Ms. Pey Grebe could not be considered an independent Claimant because she had not been a claimant in the first arbitration. The Resubmission Tribunal found that the only issue properly before it was the nature of the compensation due for the breaches established by the First Award. The Resubmission Tribunal ruled that Claimants' allegations pertaining to the 24 July 2008 Santiago Civil Court judgment were outside of its jurisdiction, which was limited to the dispute that had originally been submitted to ICSID arbitration. The Resubmission Tribunal confirmed that the First Tribunal's ruling that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over Claimants' expropriation claim had *res judicata* effects and that Claimants' request for damages resulting from the original expropriation were to be rejected on that basis. Finally, the Resubmission Tribunal concluded that Claimants had only put forward evidence that sought to calculate damages based on the expropriation claim, but not on the violation of the FET standard. The Resubmission Tribunal thus concluded that the only relief to which Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation were entitled was satisfaction.\n\n42.\n\nOn 20 September 2016, Claimants wrote to ICSID, submitting that they had just discovered that barristers who were members of the same set of chambers as Messrs. Berman and Veeder (*viz.*, Essex Court Chambers) had worked on a number of other matters involving Chile. Claimants argued that this issue raised questions about Mr. Berman's and Mr. Veeder's independence and impartiality and requested a detailed account of any relationships that any Essex Court Chambers barristers may have had with Chile.\n\n43.\n\nOn 27 October 2016, Claimants initiated a Rectification Proceeding and asked the Resubmission Tribunal to suspend the Rectification Proceeding so that they could pursue interpretation proceedings in relation to the First Award. The Resubmission Tribunal dismissed this request.\n\n44.\n\nOn 22 November 2016, Claimants requested the disqualification of Messrs. Berman and Veeder, invoking Chile's representation by other barristers from Essex Court Chambers in other proceedings.\n\n45.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, Dr. Kim issued a decision rejecting Claimants' challenges to Messrs. Berman and Veeder, finding that the challenges were untimely. Dr. Kim concluded that the information which formed the basis for the challenges had been publicly available in the media since 2012 but that no concerns had been raised at that time in the arbitral proceedings.\n\n46.\n\nOn 23 February 2017, Claimants filed a second challenge against Mr. Veeder. The following day, Claimants asked Mr. Berman to recuse himself from deciding the challenge against Mr. Veeder. Mr. Berman recused himself on 1 March 2017. On 4 March 2017, Claimants also challenged Mr. Berman and requested that the two challenges be submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration for a decision.\n\n47.\n\nOn 6 March 2017, ICSID informed the parties that it would treat Claimants' second requests to disqualify Messrs. Veeder and Berman as a proposal to disqualify the majority of the Tribunal, to be decided by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n48.\n\nOn 13 April 2017, Dr. Kim issued a second decision dismissing Claimants' challenges to Messrs. Berman and Veeder.\n\n49.\n\nOn 21 April 2017, Claimants requested the discontinuance of the Rectification Proceeding but, following Chile's opposition, the request was dismissed.\n\n50.\n\nOn 9 June 2017, Claimants (i) asked the Resubmission Tribunal to order Chile to disclose any information not publicly available relating to any payments made to Essex Court Chambers barristers by Chile's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and (ii) asked the Resubmission Tribunal and ICSID to investigate this issue and disclose the results to the Parties.\n\n51.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal rejected Claimants' request on the basis that it lacked any connection with the rectification requested.\n\n52.\n\nOn 29 June 2017, the Foundation initiated legal proceedings in the Santiago Civil Court seeking documents regarding the retainer by Chile of barristers from Essex Court Chambers.\n\n53.\n\nOn 6 October 2017, the Resubmission Tribunal issued its Rectification Decision in which it corrected three clerical errors in the Resubmission Award.\n\n**5. The second annulment proceedings before ICSID**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 10 October 2017, Claimants submitted an annulment request to ICSID in respect of the Resubmission Award. In their application, Claimants also requested that the Second Committee suspend the Resubmission Award's binding effect.\n\n55.\n\nOn 15 March 2018, the Second Committee dismissed Claimants' application for a stay of the Resubmission Award's binding effect, finding that an award remains binding and its *res judicata* effect remains untouched unless the award is annulled.\n\n**6. Claimants' arguments in these proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes below Claimants' arguments in these proceedings. This summary is not meant to be an exhaustive or detailed account of Claimants' contentions and is focused solely, and briefly, on matters directly germane to the issue of bifurcation.\n\n57.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent breached the Treaty in several respects.\n\n58.\n\nFirst, Claimants contend that Chile breached Articles 10(5), 3, 4 and 5 of the BIT by failing to comply with its obligations under the First Award. Claimants argue that Respondent refused to accede to their requests, dated February 2013 and April 2017, that Respondent enforce the First Award, recognize their ownership over their investment and pay damages for the Treaty violations it had committed.6\n\nMemorial, at 15-31.\n\n59.\n\nSecond, Claimants take the view that Respondent breached Article 4 of the Treaty on account of its failure to put an end to the Treaty violations established in the First Award, including denial of justice.7\n\nMemorial, at 44-48.\n\n60.\n\nThird, Claimants contend that Respondent breached Articles 3, 4 and 10(5) of the Treaty through its conduct concerning two of the members of the Resubmission Tribunal, Messrs. Berman and Veeder, members of the Essex Court chambers. In particular, Claimants take exception to what they allege are close and secretive financial connections between Chile and several members of Essex Court chambers, and to Respondent's alleged refusal to disclose such connections. Claimants consider that this amounts to fraudulent conduct which had the direct effect that the Resubmission Award \u00ab a entierement, radicalement, alt\u00e9re le sens lit\u00e9ral, le contexte, l'intention et la finalit\u00e9 syst\u00e9matiques des paras. 1, 2 et 3 du Dispositif et de tous les paragraphes de la Sentence du 8 mai 2008 ayant l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e \u00bb.8 In Claimants' view, this conduct by Respondent consolidated the denial of justice established by the First Award and is a separate breach of the Treaty.9\n\nMemorial, at 63.\n\nMemorial, at 49-68.\n\n61.\n\nFourth, Claimants argue that Respondent breached Articles 3(1), 4, 5 and 10 of the BIT by dismissing Mr. Pey Casado's claim before the Santiago Civil court for the restitution of the Goss Machine printing press on account of the expiry of the applicable statute of limitations. Claimants submit that this holding stands in marked contrast with other decisions taken in similar cases by the Chilean courts with respect to Chilean investors, where the statute of limitations was not an issue. Claimants add that the application of the statute of limitations in circumstances where Mr. Pey Casado was prevented by the restrictions imposed by the military regime to return to Chile and enforce his rights is in breach of principles of international law.10\n\nMemorial, at 32-43, 118-159.\n\n62.\n\nFifth, Claimants submit that Respondent breached Articles 1, 3(1), 4, 5, 10(2) and 10(5) of the BIT through a complex and composite act consisting of a series of actions and omissions in relation to the Santiago civil court judgment and the ensuing abandonment proceedings. Claimants submit that a first element of this composite legal act is a procedural fraud committed by Respondent, which consisted of Respondent unilaterally changing the cause of action of the claim submitted by Mr. Pey Casado before the Santiago court in order to then dismiss the claim for lack of *ius standi* and expiry of the applicable statute of limitations. In Claimants' view, a second element of this complex and composite act consisted of Respondent's machinations that prevented the notification of the 24 July 2008 judgment of the Santiago civil court to Mr. Pey Casado, in breach of the requirements of Chilean procedural law. Due to these machinations, Mr. Pey Casado only learned of the existence of this judgment in January 2011. A third element of this act, in the view of Claimants, is represented by the subsequent decisions of the Chilean courts finding *inaudita parte* that Mr. Pey Casado had abandoned the proceedings, despite the fact that the legal requirements had not been met, and subsequently dismissing his efforts to have those judgments set aside.11\n\nMemorial, at 185-240.\n\n**7. The Parties' requests for relief**\n---------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal render an award in which:\n\n\u00ab (1) Qu'il condamne la R\u00e9publique du Chili a payer aux Demanderesses une somme comprise entre 315,7 et 385,9 millions USD, valeur au 31 ao\u00fbt 2017, \u00e1 actualiser au jour de la Sentence \u00e1 intervenir, au titre de la reparation int\u00e9grale du prejudice mat\u00e9riel subi du fait des violations des articles 3(1), 4, 5 et 10(5) de l'API par la R\u00e9publique du Chili.\n\n(2) Qu'il condamne \u00e9galement l'Etat du Chili a restituer aux Demanderesses la valeur de tous les *fruits naturels et civils de la chose poss\u00e9d\u00e9e* de mauvaise foi, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats correspondants, actualis\u00e9e au jour de la Sentence \u00e1 intervenir.\n\n(3) Qu'il condamne la R\u00e9publique du Chili a restituer aux investisseurs demandeurs la valeur des dommages cons\u00e9cutifs, en particulier tous les frais encourus dans la d\u00e9fense des droits au titre de l'API relatifs a leur investissement aupr\u00e9s des cours de justice et des Tribunaux d'arbitrage relatifs aux proc\u00e9dures arbitrales, celle ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 [sic] la Sentence arbitrale du 8 mai 2008 et celle requise pour l'ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e des paras. 5 a 7 du Dispositif de cette derniere, de meme qu'a la proc\u00e9dure arbitrale initi\u00e9e en juin 2013 en vue de l'ex\u00e9cution des paras. 2 et 3 du Dispositif (cfr \u00a7 530 *supra*) ;\n\n(4) A titre subsidiaire, qu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 payer aux Demanderesses la somme de 75,6 millions USD, valeur 31 ao\u00fbt 2017, \u00e0 actualiser au jour de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir, au titre de l'enrichissement sans cause de l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 leur d\u00e9triment ;\n\n(5) A titre tr\u00e8s subsidiaire, qu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 payer aux Demanderesses la somme indiqu\u00e9e au \u00a7 540 *supra*, au titre d'indemnisation des pr\u00e9judices r\u00e9sultant du manquement \u00e0 l'obligation pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 dans la Sentence arbitrale du 8 mai 2008 en rapport avec le 3\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 1553 du Code civil chilien ; subsidiairement, la somme indiqu\u00e9e au \u00a7 545 *supra*, au titre d'indemnisation des pr\u00e9judices caus\u00e9s pour son manquement continu \u00e0 l'obligation de mettre fin au traitement des investisseurs demandeurs de mani\u00e8re injuste et in\u00e9quitable, en ce compris le d\u00e9ni de justice, \u00e9tablis dans la Sentence arbitrale du 8 mai 2008, en rapport avec les 2\u00e8me et 3\u00e8me alin\u00e9as de l'article 1555 du Code civil chilien ;\n\n(6) Qu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Mme. Coral Pey Grebe et \u00e0 la Fondation espagnole Pr\u00e9sident Allende une somme non inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 US$5,000,000 et US$500,000, respectivement, au titre de la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale du pr\u00e9judice moral subi par M. Victor Pey Casado et la Fondation espagnole du fait des violations de l'API par l'Etat du Chili ;\n\n(7) A titre subsidiaire, dans le cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal ne serait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 accorder un d\u00e9dommagement au titre de la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale du pr\u00e9judice moral, le Tribunal est pri\u00e9 de tenir compte des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s comme dommage moral pour accroitre le montant destin\u00e9 \u00e0 compenser les dommages mat\u00e9riels et financiers subis par les Demanderesses.\n\n(8) Qu'il dise que le montant allou\u00e9 sera major\u00e9 \u00e0 hauteur de l'\u00e9ventuelle diff\u00e9rence entre l'imp\u00f4t pay\u00e9, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, sur l'indemnisation re\u00e7ue par l'une ou l'autre des Demanderesses, et tout autre imp\u00f4t qui \u00e9tant l\u00e9galement exigible aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 si, en l'absence de manquement aux obligations \u00e9tablies dans l'API Espagne-Chili, les biens saisis avaient fait l'objet d'une indemnisation, afin que, apr\u00e8s la taxe applicable, le patrimoine des Demanderesses soit effectivement r\u00e9tabli ;\n\n(9) Qu'il dise que l'Etat du Chili devra effectuer le paiement des sommes dues aux parties Demanderesses \u00e0 la banque indiqu\u00e9e par celles-ci dans un d\u00e9lai de 60 jours au plus tard \u00e0 compter de la r\u00e9ception de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir ; \u00e0 d\u00e9faut, dire que le montant de la r\u00e9paration allou\u00e9 aux parties Demanderesses portera int\u00e9r\u00eats capitalis\u00e9s mensuellement \u00e0 un taux au moins \u00e9gal \u00e0 5% \u00e0 partir de la Sentence jusqu'\u00e0 complet paiement ;\n\n(10) Qu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 supporter l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des frais de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, y compris les frais et honoraires des Membres du Tribunal, les frais de proc\u00e9dure (utilisation des installations, frais de traduction, etc.) et, en cons\u00e9quence, qu'il condamne l'Etat du Chili \u00e0 rembourser, dans les 90 jours qui suivent l'envoi de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir, les parties Demanderesses les frais et co\u00fbts de proc\u00e9dure avanc\u00e9s par elles, et qu'il rembourse aux parties Demanderesses l'ensemble des frais et honoraires des avocats, experts, t\u00e9moins et autres personnes dont elles ont sollicit\u00e9 l'intervention pour la d\u00e9fense de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, portant, en cas de non remboursement dans ce d\u00e9lai, int\u00e9r\u00eats capitalis\u00e9s mensuellement \u00e0 un taux de 5%) compter de la date de la Sentence \u00e0 intervenir jusqu'\u00e0 complet paiement, ou \u00e0 toutes autres sommes que le Tribunal arbitral estimera justes et \u00e9quitables. \u00bb12\n\nMemorial, at 717.\n\n64.\n\nFor its part, Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n\"a. Immediately dismiss all of Claimants' claims (for lack of jurisdiction, inadmissibility, lack of legal merit, and/or lack of a basis upon which relief can be granted); and\n\nb. Order Claimants to pay all costs of this UNCITRAL proceeding (including arbitrator and institutional fees and expenses), as well as the totality of the fees and expenses incurred by Chile in connection with this proceeding (including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, expert fees and expenses, and translation costs), with compounded interest until the date of payment.\n\n390. In the event that the Tribunal declines to dismiss the totality of Claimants' claims immediately, Chile asks, alternatively, that the Tribunal (1) suspend its consideration of the merits, and (2) order the immediate bifurcation of the proceeding, for the purpose of having the Parties and the Tribunal address Chile's jurisdictional and admissibility objections in a separate, preliminary phase.\"13\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 389, 390.\n\n**III. RESPONDENT'S POSITION ON BIFURCATION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants cannot establish jurisdiction in respect of any of the core strands of their case. In this respect, Respondent raises the following jurisdictional objections:\n\ni. Objection No. 1: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant Claimants' requests for relief;\n\nii. Objection No. 2: the BIT does not apply to any of the claims asserted;\n\niii. Objection No. 3: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims for the alleged non-performance of the First Award;\n\niv. Objection No. 4: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims related to the Essex Court Chambers Issue;\n\nv. Objection No. 5: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims based on the Goss Machine case.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal will briefly summarize Respondent's arguments with respect to each one of these objections in the paragraphs below, it being noted that, as with Claimants' arguments, this summary is not intended to be a comprehensive or detailed restatement of all of Respondent's arguments. However, before doing so, the Tribunal notes that Respondent bases its objections on the following three arguments.\n\n67.\n\nThe first is the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings established in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. Respondent argues that, once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given by the parties to a dispute, the parties have lost the right to seek relief in another forum, be it national or international, and are restricted to pursuing their claims through ICSID. Respondent considers that the Parties in this arbitration have not opted out of the ICSID exclusivity rule by means of Article 10(3) of the BIT. In Respondent's reading, Article 10(3) of the Treaty (\"If the dispute is submitted to international arbitration, it may be brought before one of the following arbitration bodies...\")in effect reinforces the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings.14\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 224-231.\n\n68.\n\nRespondent's second argument is that Article 10(3) of the BIT, a forum selection clause employing the wording \"one of the following arbitration bodies\", necessarily implies that an investor cannot submit a particular dispute to both ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitration, but must choose between them. Respondent considers that this reading is supported both by the authentic Spanish version of the Treaty (\"En caso de recurso al arbitraje internacional la controversia podr\u00e1 ser llevada ante uno de los \u00f3rganos de arbitraje designados a continuaci\u00f3n\"), as well as by the French translation (\"devant l'un des organismes\").15\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 233, 234.\n\n69.\n\nRespondent's third argument is that, pursuant to Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 10(5) of the BIT, once an ICSID award has been rendered, the award is final and binding upon the parties and not subject to an appeal.16\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 235.\n\n**1. Objection No. 1: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant Claimants' requests for relief**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants are seeking four types of relief in this arbitration, all four of which the Tribunal cannot grant.\n\n71.\n\nFirst, Respondent notes that Claimants are seeking compensation under the BIT for the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*. In Respondent's view, such a request for compensation must necessarily be based on a valid expropriation claim. Respondent considers that, however, Claimants are not permitted to argue that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* amounted to a violation of the BIT because the First Award conclusively determined that such expropriation was outside the temporal scope of the Treaty. Respondent adds that *res judicata* principles preclude Claimants from challenging the conclusion in the First Award that the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn* occurred instantaneously in the 1970s and was not the result of a continuous act. Respondent further submits that Claimants cannot divorce the value of the expropriated property from the expropriated property itself by claiming that the value of the property was not lost until compensation was denied by Chile. The First Award likewise prevents this argument from being made, since it found that a post-BIT refusal to indemnify Claimants for an expropriation which had occurred prior to its entry into force is not an independent basis for an expropriation claim.17\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 241-245.\n\n72.\n\nSecond, Respondent considers that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear Claimants' claim that Chile failed to comply with the obligations imposed upon it by the First Award, a claim which they classify as \"shockingly abusive\".18 In this respect, Respondent argues that the exclusivity rule that attaches to ICSID proceedings precludes Claimants from arguing before an UNCITRAL tribunal that Respondent failed to comply with a final ICSID award. Respondent considers that such a claim can only be made - and was made - before an ICSID tribunal and Claimants should not be allowed to appeal before an UNCITRAL tribunal the findings of that ICSID tribunal. Respondent adds that, in any event, the Resubmission Award concluded with *res judicata* effect that Claimants were owed no compensation.19\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 246.\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 246-251.\n\n73.\n\nThird, Respondent notes that Claimants are requesting reimbursement of their costs incurred in the First Arbitration, the Revision Proceeding, the First Annulment Proceeding, the Supplementation Proceeding and an enforcement proceeding in Spain relating to the First Award. Respondent states that Claimants have already requested this remedy from the Resubmission Tribunal. In Respondent's view, Claimants' claims relating to these ICSID proceedings are barred by the *res judicata* effects that attach to the decisions on costs rendered in each proceeding by the respective ICSID tribunals. These decisions may not be revisited here. The claim for costs of the Spanish enforcement proceedings are, in Respondent's opinion, likewise barred by the *res judicata* principle, as the relevant Spanish court ruled that only a portion of the attorneys' fees were recoverable. Respondent adds that it has already paid to Claimants the cost amounts that were established by the ICSID tribunals, as well as by the judgment of the Spanish court.20\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 252-260.\n\n74.\n\nFourth, Respondent notes that Ms. Pey Grebe and the Foundation are seeking moral damages for acts that are either outside the temporal scope of application of the Treaty (the expropriation of *El Clar\u00edn*) or for various other acts (the treatment of Mr. Pey Casado by the military dictatorship; statements by Chilean officials that Mr. Pey Casado was not the true owner of *El Clar\u00edn* ; the conduct found by the First Award to be in breach of the Treaty; Chile's alleged attempt to conceal the 24 July 2008 judgment; and the alleged non-performance of the First Award) for which similar claims for moral damages were submitted before ICSID. Respondent argues that these claims are barred by the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings and the BIT's forum selection clause.21\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 261-264.\n\n**2. Objection No. 2: the BIT does not apply to any of the claims asserted**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nRespondent argues that the Treaty texts relied upon by Claimants (Articles 3, 4 and 5)22 all presuppose the existence of an investment in Chile's territory on the date of the BIT violations alleged. Respondent submits that, based on Claimants' characterization of their claims, it appears that the events which give rise to the present arbitration occurred after 24 July 2008, the date of the Santiago civil court judgment. However, in Respondent's submission, Claimants did not have a qualifying investment as at 24 July 2008.23\n\nRespondent contends that Article 10 of the BIT, the dispute resolution clause, cannot form the basis of a BIT merits claim (Counter-Memorial, at 269).\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 267-271.\n\n76.\n\nIn this respect, Respondent argues that the First Award established with finality that that the assets of CPP and EPC were definitively expropriated in 1975, when CPP and EPC were dissolved. Respondent maintains that, according to the First Award, these events occurred prior to the entry into force of the BIT. In Respondent's submission, no investment of Mr. Pey Casado remained after the definitive confiscation of *El Clar\u00edn* in the 1970s. Respondent takes issue with Claimants' submission, according to which their investment consists of the protections set forth in the BIT. In Respondent's view, such an interpretation is untenable, particularly in light of the express definition of an \"investment\" in the Treaty. Finally, Respondent disputes that the 24 July 2008 Santiago civil court judgment resurrected Mr. Pey Casado's investment in *El Clar\u00edn*.24\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 272-277.\n\n**3. Objection No. 3: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims for the alleged non-performance of the First Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants seek to establish in these proceedings that Chile breached the Treaty by failing to comply with the obligations imposed upon it in the First Award. Respondent argues that this Tribunal lacks the authority to decide the issue of what relief was due by Chile for the BIT violation identified in the First Award, as this was the purpose of the Resubmission Proceeding before ICSID. The Resubmission Tribunal concluded with *res judicata* effect that Claimants were not owed compensation for the breaches identified in the First Award, and that satisfaction was sufficient reparation. Respondent argues that this conclusion cannot be revisited here.25\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 279-283.\n\n**4. Objection No. 4: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims related to the Essex Court Chambers issue**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants' contentions pertaining to the Essex Court Chambers issue have already been submitted to ICSID in the Rectification Proceeding and in the Second Annulment Proceeding. Respondent is of the view that the exclusivity which attaches to ICSID proceedings and the BIT's forum selection rule preclude Claimants from seeking a second opinion here, as do the principles of *lis pendens* and *ne bis in idem*.26\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 284, 285.\n\n**5. Objection No. 5: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims based on the Goss Machine case**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nRespondent takes the view that Claimants are prevented from advancing before this Tribunal the argument that the 24 July 2008 Santiago civil court judgment was favorable to them but that Chile prevented them from reaping its attendant benefits. Respondent bases this argument on Claimants having already raised this argument before several ICSID tribunals: during the First Annulment Proceeding, the Resubmission Proceeding and the Second Annulment Proceeding.27\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 286-289.\n\n80.\n\nIn Respondent's submission, the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings and the BIT's forum selection clause act as bars to the reiteration of these claims. In this respect, Respondent notes that, in 2002, Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation amended their claims before the First Tribunal by transferring the substance of the Goss machine case before ICSID. Respondent considers that the First Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over this claim, which permitted it to then find that Chile had committed a denial of justice in the Santiago civil court proceedings. Respondent adds that the First Award's finding that Chile had denied Mr. Pey Casado justice in the Santiago civil court proceedings amounts to a finding of a complete failure by the Chilean justice system. Consequently, in its view, any subsequent deficiencies in the same proceeding cannot amount to a new BIT claim, as unfair and inequitable treatment and discrimination are lesser offences encompassed within the more serious finding of a denial of justice.28\n\nCounter-Memorial, at 290-299.\n\n81.\n\nAs a remedy, Respondent first requests that the Tribunal exercise its authority under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules allowing it to limit written submissions to one round of pleadings, and dismiss Claimants' claims outright, without any further submissions from the Parties.29\n\nChile's Supplementary Submission on Bifurcation, at 3.\n\n82.\n\nSecond and in the alternative, Respondent requests the bifurcation of the above-listed objections from the merits of this case.\n\n83.\n\nRespondent notes that, in Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal concluded that \"in deciding whether to hear jurisdictional objections with priority or to join them to the merits, the following considerations are notably relevant: (a) whether the objections to jurisdiction are *prima facie* substantial and not frivolous; (b) whether bifurcation would result in substantial cost savings and efficiency gains and the sound administration of these proceedings; (c) whether the jurisdictional objections are closely intertwined with the merits of the case; and (d) whether bifurcation would preserve the Parties' procedural rights.\"30 Respondent considers that its jurisdictional objections above warrant the bifurcation of these arbitral proceedings.31\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, at 66.\n\nChile's Supplementary Submission on Bifurcation, at 3.\n\n84.\n\nFirst, Respondent contends that its objections are serious and not frivolous.32\n\nChile's Supplementary Submission on Bifurcation, at 4.\n\n85.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that bifurcation would greatly increase efficiency in the present case. In its submission, each one of its objections has the potential to dispose of the entire case and dispense with the need to discuss a multitude of complex factual issues and merits theories that would require a full-fledged merits proceeding. Respondent adds that bifurcation would not generate inefficiencies in light of the fact that the jurisdictional objections need to be heard in any event.33\n\nChile's Supplementary Submission on Bifurcation, at 5.\n\n86.\n\nThird, Respondent contends that bifurcation would not be inefficient, as the jurisdictional objections above are not closely intertwined with the merits. In its submission, each objection poses a threshold question that can be separated from the merits without difficulty: (i) whether the Tribunal has authority to grant the relief requested; (ii) whether Claimants had an investment on the critical dates; and (iii) whether Claimants are permitted to assert specific claims.34\n\nChile's Supplementary Submission on Bifurcation, at 6.\n\n87.\n\nFourth, Respondent maintains that bifurcation would have the effect of preserving Chile's procedural right to immunity from repeat and parallel litigation. In Respondent's submission, this principle holds especially true in the case of UNCITRAL proceedings, which expressly contain a presumption in favor of bifurcation, but no screening mechanism or express opportunity for summary judgment to protect against abusive claims.35\n\nChile's Supplementary Submission on Bifurcation, at 7-9.\n\n**IV. CLAIMANTS' POSITION ON BIFURCATION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nClaimants are of the view that the Request for Bifurcation should be dismissed, as the dispute submitted to arbitration in the present proceeding is conceptually distinct from the First Arbitration. In this respect, Claimants refer to the Second Committee's holding of 15 March 2018, according to which:36\n\n\u00ab Le Comit\u00e9 confirme que les effets de l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e et de la litispendance interdisent aux Demanderesses d'exercer \u00ab tout autre recours \u00bb en rapport avec les demandes soumises \u00e0 l'arbitrage CIRDI, comme le pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment l'article 26 de la Convention. (...) Toutefois, ces principes ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 de nouvelles demandes, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 des demandes qui r\u00e9sultent pr\u00e9tendument de violations du TBI qui se sont produit apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure arbitrale dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Pour reprendre les termes employ\u00e9s par le Tribunal du Nouvel Examen, la \u00ab date critique \u00bb est la date de la requ\u00eate d'arbitrage initiale des Demanderesses, soit le 3 novembre 1997. \u00bb37\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une bifurcation, at 3, 4.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado et Fondation Pr\u00e9sident Allende c. R\u00e9publique du Chili* (Affaire CIRDI ARB/98/2 Deuxi\u00e8me proc\u00e9dure en annulation), D\u00e9cision sur la demande de suspension de l'ex\u00e9cution de la sentence, 15 mars 2018, paragraphes 79, 80 (Pi\u00e8ce C-461).\n\n89.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent are in breach of Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the principles of international law codified in Article 30 of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\"). Claimants maintain that the Resubmission Tribunal confirmed that it lacked jurisdiction to hear disputes that arose between the Parties after the date when the Request for Arbitration was filed with ICSID, *i.e.*, November 1997. Claimants submit that, in conformity with Article 31 of the ILC Articles and the First Award, Respondent was under an obligation to make full reparation for the damage it caused by means of its unlawful acts. In their view, the present Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain such a claim.38\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une bifurcation, at 5-9.\n\n90.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear claims based on breaches that are subsequent to the First Award. Claimants submit that their claims in this arbitration are based on Treaty breaches posterior to 8 May 2008, the date of the First Award. Claimants argue that Article 10(3) of the Treaty does not prevent them from bringing new claims before an UNCITRAL tribunal. Claimants add that, in any event, Article 10(3) of the Treaty does not represent a fork-in-the-road clause, as the word \"uno\" in Spanish is intended to be an indefinite article.39\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une bifurcation, at 12-14.\n\n91.\n\nThird, Claimants submit that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear a new claim against Chile, which is based on the fact that Respondent did not put an end to the breaches established in the First Award. Claimants consider that such a claim is founded on Article 10(5) of the Treaty and customary international law.40\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e1 une bifurcation, at 16, 17.\n\n92.\n\nFourth, Claimants add that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to set the quantum of the damages owed by Respondent for its breaches of Article 4 of the Treaty and that Articles 26 and 52(6) of the ICSID Convention do not act as a bar to this Tribunal's jurisdiction. In this respect, Claimants argue that the question of the damages owed by Respondent for the breaches committed in 2000 and 2002 has not been decided on the merits by ICSID tribunals. Claimants consider that the First Commission annulled the damages section of the First Award on account of the fact that the parties had not been heard on the question of \u00ab l'\u00e9quivalence du montant du dommage pour les violations commises a l'article 4 de API en 2000 et 2002 - infraction au traitement juste et \u00e9quitable - avec ce qu'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le montant pour violation a l'article 5 - expropriation indirecte des droits des investisseurs existant en 2000 et 2002 \u00bb.41 According to Claimants, the Resubmission Tribunal made it impossible for Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation to demonstrate this equivalence when it concluded that the issues that had intervened between the parties subsequent to 3 November 1997 were outside of its jurisdiction. Claimants contend that, for this reason, when determining the compensation due to Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation, the Resubmission Tribunal did not take into consideration the evidence put forward by the claimants on the damage suffered beginning with May 2000. Claimants thus conclude that Articles 26 and 52(6) of the ICSID Convention are inapposite in this case.42\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e1 une bifurcation, at 19.\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e1 une bifurcation, at 18-22.\n\n93.\n\nFifth, Claimants maintain that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to establish the damages suffered as a result of the indirect expropriation of their investment and of other breaches that occurred after 8 May 2008. In this respect, Claimants argue that, after 8 May 2008, Respondent engaged in a series of actions and omissions meant to indirectly expropriate \u00ab de droits qui sont actuellement couverts par l'API avec l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e \u00bb.43 As support, Claimants refer to a series of rights which they argue were established by the First Award and the First Annulment Decision.44\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e1 une bifurcation, at 23.\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e1 une bifurcation, at 23, 24.\n\n94.\n\nSixth, Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute which arose on 28 January 2011 as a result of the delay in the notification of the 24 July 2008 Santiago civil court judgment and the subsequent denial of justice in the ensuing court proceedings.45\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e1 une bifurcation, at 25-29.\n\n95.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear a claim for denial of justice which resulted from Respondent's concealment of the extent of its connections with barristers from Essex Court Chambers, including two arbitrators on the Resubmission Tribunal. Claimants contend that this concealment has prevented them from having access to an impartial international arbitral tribunal, a question which has not been decided so far.46\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une bifurcation, at 30-34.\n\n96.\n\nTurning more specifically to the issue of bifurcation, Claimants argue that Respondent's Request for Bifurcation should be dismissed as Respondent's jurisdictional objections are too closely intertwined with the merits. In Claimants' view, Respondent is responsible for the overlap between the questions pertaining to jurisdiction and the questions going to the merits of the case, on account of its concealment of certain elements of fact and the manipulation undertaken by its State institutions. Claimants maintain that bifurcating these proceedings would lead to a waste of time and financial resources, whereas joining Respondent's jurisdictional objections to the merits would preserve the rights of both Parties to the dispute.47\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une bifurcation, at 35.\n\n97.\n\nFor these reasons, Claimants request that the Tribunal decide the following:\n\n\"1. Qu'il rejette les exceptions \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal que soul\u00e8ve l'Etat au motif qu'il enfreigne a) les principes de droit international cit\u00e9s *supra* (\u00a7\u00a78-11, 13), b) la forclusion, c) la *res judicata*, c) les articles 2(2), 10(1), 10(3), 10(5) de l'API, d) pour abus de proc\u00e8s, e) et mauvaise foi ;\n\n2. Qu'il rejette la demande de bifurcation compte tenu que celle-ci, loin d'entra\u00eener des \u00e9conomies de temps et de ressources, favoriserait des confusions requ\u00e9rant le recours \u00e0 des consid\u00e9rations r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es sur le fond, et augmenterait la dur\u00e9e et les frais de la proc\u00e9dure,. Alors que la non-bifurcation pr\u00e9serverait les droits proc\u00e9duraux de toutes les Parties.\n\n3. Qu'il condamne l'Etat \u00e0 supporter l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des frais de l'incident relatif \u00e0 sa demande de bifurcation, de m\u00eame qu'\u00e0 rembourser aux parties Demanderesses l'ensemble des frais et honoraires des avocats et des personnes dont elles ont sollicit\u00e9 l'intervention pour la d\u00e9fense de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats, portant, en cas de non remboursement, int\u00e9r\u00eats capitalis\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 complet paiement, ainsi qu'\u00e0 toute autre somme que le Tribunal arbitral estimerait juste et \u00e9quitable. \u00bb48\n\nObservations sur la demande compl\u00e9mentaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une bifurcation, p. 10.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's request to dispense with further submissions from the Parties and dismiss the case outright. The written submissions of the Parties filed thus far have made it abundantly clear that the present dispute involves a number of complex legal and factual issues that require further development. The Tribunal is not prepared to limit the Parties\u2019 right to make submissions as requested by Respondent.\n\n99.\n\nTurning now to Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, the Tribunal reiterates that its task at this stage of the proceedings is not to decide or take any position on the merits or lack thereof of Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections. The Tribunal\u2019s task is to determine whether it would be conducive to an effective administration of these arbitral proceedings to hear Respondent\u2019s objections separately from the merits.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules49 creates a presumption in favor of treating the issue of jurisdiction as a preliminary question:50\n\n\"(4) In general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. However, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and rule on such a plea in their final award.\"\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the 2010 version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules no longer includes such a presumption.\n\n*See*, *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America* (UNCITRAL), Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, at 9; *Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) v. Government of India* (PCA Case No. 2016-7), Procedural Order No. 4 - Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation, 19 April 2017, at 70.\n\n101.\n\nHowever, as accepted by Respondent, that presumption is not absolute. The Tribunal retains a significant degree of discretion when determining whether the efficient administration of the proceedings counsels in favor of hearing an objection to jurisdiction separately from, or joined to, the merits.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established in Procedural Order No. 2 that the following considerations are to be weighed in deciding for or against bifurcation: (a) whether the objections to jurisdiction are *prima facie* substantial and not frivolous; (b) whether bifurcation would result in substantial cost savings and efficiency gains and the sound administration of these proceedings; (c) whether the jurisdictional objections are closely intertwined with the merits of the case; and (d) whether bifurcation would preserve the Parties\u2019 procedural rights.\n\n**1. Objection No. 1: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant Claimants' requests for relief**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties\u2019 positions and, in light of the circumstances of this case, finds that it is appropriate and would promote procedural efficiency to bifurcate Objection No. 1 from the merits of this case.\n\n104.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal first observes that Objection No. 1 is *prima facie* serious and substantial, as it goes to the very basis of this Tribunal's power to award the relief sought by Claimants.\n\n105.\n\nSecond, if upheld, this objection will result in the dismissal of Claimants' entire case, thereby ensuring that economies of time and costs are made. The Tribunal acknowledges that, because the Parties have already submitted their first round of pleadings on jurisdiction and the merits, the efficiencies gained by bifurcation will necessarily be more limited than in a situation where bifurcation would have been ordered at the outset of the proceedings. However, the Tribunal considers that, if efficiencies can be gained in terms of time and costs by deciding at least some of the issues in this complex case with priority bifurcation is warranted. Bifurcation will permit the Parties to better structure their pleadings and carefully distill the salient issues that need to be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n106.\n\nThird, the Tribunal considers that deciding Objection No. 1 will involve answering legal questions which are not closely intertwined with the merits of this case. Indeed, the Tribunal will not have to decide whether Claimants' requests for relief should be granted, or, in other words, whether *inter alia* Respondent failed to comply with the obligations imposed upon it by the First Award, or whether Respondent committed a denial of justice in the Santiago civil court proceedings. The Tribunal will only have to determine whether it has the legal authority to grant the relief requested. The Tribunal does not exclude that, in this analysis, it will have to examine some evidence that is also relevant to the merits of this case, for instance some findings made by the First Tribunal, the First Committee or the Resubmission Tribunal. However, the Tribunal is of the view that the existence of some degree of overlap between the evidence relevant for answering jurisdictional questions and evidence relevant for answering questions pertaining to the merits is not an obstacle to bifurcation. What would be required in order to join an objection to the merits is a more substantial overlap51, such that a jurisdictional question could not be decided efficiently without also ruling on the merits of the case.\n\n*See*, *Lao Holdings N.V. and Sanum Investments Limited v. Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/2) (ICSID Case No. ADHOC/17/1), Procedural Order No. 2 (Decision on Respondent's Applications of 18 September 2017), 23 October 2017, at 45.\n\n107.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that bifurcation does not affect the principle of equality of the Parties. The jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent would need to be decided whether the Tribunal bifurcates or not. Both Parties will have opportunities to present their arguments and evidence, and will be heard by the Tribunal.\n\n108.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal will deal with Objection No. 1 as a preliminary question.\n\n**2. Objection No. 2: the BIT does not apply to any of the claims asserted**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Objection No. 2 can and should also be heard separately from the merits.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial as it questions the very basis of Claimants\u2019 claims before this Tribunal. Second, this objection, if upheld, will result in the dismissal of Claimants\u2019 entire case, thus resulting in economies of time and costs.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that this question can be answered separately from the merits of the case. Indeed, in order to rule on Objection No. 2, the Tribunal will only have to determine whether the Treaty required that Claimants have an investment at the time of the alleged breaches and, only in the eventuality of an affirmative answer to this question, determine whether Claimants are correct that the 24 July 2008 Santiago civil court judgment established the nullity of Decree No. 165. The Tribunal will not have to establish whether Respondent failed to comply with its obligations under the First Award, whether Respondent committed a denial of justice in the Santiago civil court proceedings or in the subsequent abandonment proceedings. Those inquiries will properly be left for the merits of the case, should the proceedings advance to that stage. The Tribunal reiterates that it is not altogether excluded that some of the evidence that is pertinent for deciding the merits of this case will also be pertinent to rule on Objection No. 2. However, the Tribunal is of the view that the two questions can be sufficiently separated from each other so that hearing Objection No. 2 with priority will not also involve deciding Claimants\u2019 claim for denial of justice.\n\n112.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that bifurcation does not affect the principle of equality of the Parties, as the jurisdictional objections placed before the Tribunal by Respondent would need to be decided whether the Tribunal bifurcates or not.\n\n113.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal will thus address Objection No. 2 as a preliminary question.\n\n**3. Objection No. 3: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims for the alleged non-performance of the First Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal shall deal with Objection No. 3 as a preliminary question. The Tribunal finds that this objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial, as it goes to the power of the Tribunal to hear one of Claimants\u2019 claims. Moreover, hearing Objection No. 3 separately would result in efficiencies of time and costs, as the objection, if admitted, would result in a decrease of the number of claims that the Tribunal needs to address. Finally, the Tribunal is persuaded that the objection can be heard without implicitly ruling on the merits of this case.\n\n**4. Objection No. 4: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims related to the Essex Court Chambers issue**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal shall deal with Objection No. 4 as a preliminary question. The Tribunal considers that this objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial, as it goes to the power of the Tribunal to hear one of Claimants\u2019 claims in this arbitration. Moreover, hearing Objection No. 4 separately would result in efficiencies of time and costs, as the objection, if admitted, would result in a decrease of the number of claims that the Tribunal needs to address. Finally, the Tribunal is persuaded that the objection can be heard without touching on the merits of this case.\n\n**5. Objection No. 5: the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain claims based on the Goss Machine case**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal decides to join Objection No. 5 to the merits of this case.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this objection is very closely connected to the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims such that it would be difficult to separate the substance of Claimants\u2019 claims pertaining to the Santiago civil court proceedings from the various arguments made by Mr. Pey Casado and the Foundation before prior ICSID tribunals and the decisions taken by those prior tribunals. Moreover, in order to answer Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal would also have to assess Respondent\u2019s argument pursuant to which the denial of justice identified in the First Award encompasses what Respondent deems to be the lesser offences of unfair and inequitable treatment and discrimination. The Tribunal considers that this inquiry goes to the heart of the substance of Claimants\u2019 Treaty claims and requires the Tribunal to make a decision on the contents of various standards of protection under the Treaty. These are analyses that are better suited to the merits stage of the arbitration.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n118.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\ni. Determines to deal with Objections Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 as preliminary questions;\n\nii. Rejects Respondent\u2019s application to deal with Objection No. 5 as a preliminary question and joins it to the merits of the dispute;\n\niii. Rejects Respondent\u2019s request to dispense with further submissions from the Parties and to dismiss the case outright;\n\niv. Reserves all other issues to a further order, decision or award, including any question as to costs;\n\nv. Directs the Parties to confer and agree on a procedural calendar dedicated to hearing Objections Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and revert back to the Tribunal by 9 July 2018."}]}
