INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nWith deepest regret, I feel compelled to vote against the decision of the majority rejecting the Respondent\u2019s Objection to Jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis.* Doing so is all the more frustrating since I concur in general with the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision in Article 8 of the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between Barbados and Venezuela does not constitute a basis of jurisdiction *per se.*1 This was the main basis for jurisdiction invoked by the Claimant. In addition, the Claimant argued that the most favoured nation treatment clause (hereinafter \"MFN clause\") of Article 3 was applicable to the ISDS provision in Article 8 offering another basis of jurisdiction. This argument for jurisdiction was accepted by my distinguished colleagues. I regret in particular that the majority embarked upon a different construction of Article 8 to that used first while applying it to the provisions of the MFN clause in Article 3 (2). The Tribunal unanimously agrees that \"the MFN clause cannot serve the purpose of importing consent to arbitration when none exists under the BIT between Barbados and Venezuela\".2 Despite this position, and the explicit contention that it is not doing so,3 this is unfortunately the approach that the majority has taken in its decision: to import the consent Venezuela has made regarding UNCITRAL arbitration in other BITs to the present case in which there is none. This is the first time in which a tribunal has accepted that possibility.\n\nInterim Award, para. 89\n\nInterim Award, para. 105.\n\nInterim Award, para. 111.\n\n2.\n\nThe question the Tribunal had to decide was one which constitutes the very foundation and the basis of the existence of jurisdiction for any international court or tribunal: whether a State has given its consent or not. International courts and tribunals must be extremely cautious in this regard: an exercise of jurisdiction in a dispute by which consent has not been given constitutes a serious infringement of the sovereignty of the State or States concerned.4\n\nProfessor Georges Abi-Saab explains the situation in the following terms: \"In international law, all tribunals \u2014 not only arbitral, but even judicial \u2014 are tribunals of attributed, hence limited jurisdiction... This is because, in the absence of a centralized power on the international level that exercises the judicial function through a judicial system empowered from above (or rather incarnating the judicial power as part of the centralized power), all international adjudicatory bodies are empowered from below, being based on the consent and agreement of the subjects (i.e. the litigants, les justiciable) themselves... This is the reason why, the fundamental principle and basic rule in international adjudication, is that of the consensual basis of jurisdiction... It explains as well the widely shared perception that the first task of an international tribunal is to ascertain its jurisdiction; and the great care international tribunals take in establishing from the outset, the existence and limits of the consent of the parties before them, on which their jurisdiction is founded.\" *Abaclat and Others v Argentine Republic,*ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Dissenting Opinion to Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 4, 2011, paras. 7 and 8.\n\n3.\n\nThis requirement for such care in the exercise of the *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* principle is even more acute in the case of *ad hoc* tribunals in which arbitrators are appointed to deal with a given dispute and consequently not acting as members of a permanent pre-established judicial body. This is more acute still in investment arbitration, in which the potential number of claimants invoking any kind of formula to establish consent and thereby the creation of tribunals could be unlimited. In my view, the majority of this Tribunal has erred in the exercise of its jurisdiction to decide on jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* for the reasons I set out below.\n\n4.\n\nThe question of the applicability of MFN clauses to ISDS provisions contained in BITs has been an object of contention at the doctrinal level and in case law. Starting with the decision in *Maffezini,* MFN provisions have been invoked as regards ISDS clauses for different purposes: (1) to avoid preconditions to arbitration such as resorting to local tribunals for a period of time (usually 18 months) before going to investor-State arbitration;5 (2) to broaden the ISDS provision when that provision is limited to questions relating to the \"amount of compensation\" or to \"expropriation\" or similar;6 (3) to import a definition of \"investment\" or \"investor\";7 (4) to apply the international investment agreement retroactively;8 (5) to avoid emergency clauses or exceptions in international investment agreements;9 (6) to invoke other dispute settlement mechanisms;10 and (7) to incorporate investor-State arbitration into a treaty that does not have a valid investor-State arbitral provision.11 With the exception of situation (1), where there are opposing views, tribunals have consistently rejected the use of MFN provisions to alter the scope of the ISDS provisions or to create consent, with only two exceptions *(Roslnvest* and *Garant\u00ed Koza).* As for the first situation, numerous tribunals have accepted this possibility12 while other tribunals (generally speaking more recent ones) consider that this is not possible.13\n\n*Maffezini v Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000; *Siemens AG v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004;*Gas Natural SDG SA v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/10, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 June 2005; *Telefonica v Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/20, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 May 2006; *National Grid v Argentina,* UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction, 20 June 2006; **Suez and ors v Argentina,** ICSID Case No ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 May 2006; **Suez and ors v Argentina,**ICSID Case No ARB/03/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, 03 August 2006; *Wintershall v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/04/14, Award, 8 December 2008; *Impregilo SpA v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/17, Final Award, 21 June 2011; *Hochtief AG v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011; *ICS v Argentina,* PCA Case No 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction (10 February 2012); *Daimler Financial Services AG v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012; *Teinver SA v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012; *Kili\u00e7 Insaat Ithalat Ihracat Sanayi Ve Ticaret Anonim Sirkeli v Turkmenistan,,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/1, Award, 2 July 2013; *Dede and Elh\u00fcseyni v Romania,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/22, Award, 5 September 2013.\n\n*Salini Costruttori SpA and Italstrade SpA v Jordan,* ICSID Case No ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 15 November 2004; *Berschader v Russian Federation,* SCC Case No 080/2004, Award and Correction, 21 April 2006, para. 185; *Telenor Mobile Communications AS v Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/04/15, Award, 22 June 2006; *Renta 4 SVSA and ors v Russian Federation,* SCC Case No 24/2007, Award on Preliminary Objections, 20 March 2009; *Tza Yap Shum v Peru,* Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No ARB/07/6; *Austrian Airlines v Slovakia* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 09 October 2009; *European American Investment Bank AG (EURAM) v Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 October 2012; *Les Laboratoires Servier, SA A., Biofarma, SA.S., Arts et Techniques du Progr\u00e8s S.A.S. v Republic of Poland,* UNCITRAL, Award, 14 February 2012; *Accession Mezzanine Capital LP and Danubius Keresked\u00f4h\u00e2z Vagyonkezel\u00f4 v Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/12/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), 16 January 2013; *Emmis International Holding, BV and ors v Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/12/2, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), 11 March 2013; *ST-AD GmbH v Republic of Bulgaria,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2011-06, Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July 2013; *Sanum Investments Limited v Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2013-13, Award on Jurisdiction, 13 December 2013.\n\n*Yaung Chi Oo Trading Pte Ltd v Myanmar,* ASEAN Case No ARB/01/1, Award; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v Dominican Republic,* UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008; *HICEE BV v Slovakia,* PCA Case No 2009-11, Partial Award, 23 May 2011; *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v.

In the last category (situation (7)), in which this case falls, as I will develop below, there has been no available arbitration offer in the base treaty and tribunals analysing similar situations have \u2014 prior to this case \u2014 unanimously rejected the possibility of creating consent through the MFN provision.\n\n6.\n\nThe 2015 *Final Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission on the Most-Favoured Nation Clause* has been very cautious while affirming that [a]lthough controversial in some of the earlier decisions of tribunals, there is little doubt that *in principle* MFN provisions are capable of applying to the dispute settlement provisions of BITs\".14 To put it otherwise, if MFN clauses can be applied to ISDS provisions, this is not the case in any circumstance, and even less automatically applicable. As will be demonstrated in this opinion, the majority decision is the one that has gone the farthest in the use of a MFN clause in order to establish jurisdiction.\n\nStudy Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, Final Report, Annex to the Report of the International Law Commission, 70 UNGAOR Supp. No. 10, UN Doc. A/70/10 (14 August 2015), p. 182, para. 162.\n\n7.\n\nThis dissenting opinion is divided into two main parts. The first part examines the scope of the MFN clause of Article 3 **(II.).** Here, I will demonstrate that the MFN clause of Article 3(2) cannot be applied to Article 8. Also, that even assuming that this clause were applicable to Article 8, and there were an obligation by Venezuela *to offer* UNCITRAL arbitration to Barbadian investors, there is still *no consent* bY Venezuela to this arbitration. The second part of this dissent is an interpretation of the ISDS provision of Article 8 of the BIT **(III.).** I will also show that, in the current situation, it is impossible to find consent to UNCITRAL arbitration in Article 8(4). The statement of dissent will finish with some concluding remarks (IV.).\n\n**II. THE WORDING OF ARTICLE 3 (3) OF THE BIT AND THE DETERMINATION OF ITS SCOPE**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nTo facilitate the reading of this opinion, Article 3 of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT is cited here again:\n\n**National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Provisions**\n\n(1) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own nationals or companies or to investments or returns of nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(3) The treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.\n\n9.\n\nIn this section, I will explain why Article 3 (3) does not automatically imply the applicability of the MFN clause to Article 8 and indeed why it is not applicable **(A).** After having interpreted Article 3 (2)**(B),** I will also demonstrate that even applying the MFN Clause of Article 3 (2) to Article 8, there is still no jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* **(C).**\n\n**A. Article 3 (3) does not automatically lead to the application of the MFN Clause to Article 8**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nBoth parties to this case agree that Article 8 is governed by the MFN clauses contained in paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 3 since its paragraph (3) states that \"[t]he treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) (...) shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement\". They disagree just with regard to the scope of this applicability. The Tribunal is not bound by the interpretation to the provisions of the BIT followed by the parties to the case. Furthermore, the parties to this case are not identical to those of the Treaty. Only one party to the BIT is a party to this dispute. It may be that the parties to the case are simply wrong in their interpretation. I feel no need to demonstrate that international courts and tribunals can follow and indeed have followed a different interpretation of a conventional provision than those advanced by the parties to a case. The Tribunal\u2019s majority also took for granted the applicability of Article 3 to Article 8. At first sight, this indeed appears to be the case, since evidently Article 8 is included in the formula \"Articles 1 to 11\". As I will demonstrate, this is not enough, however, to conclude as to the \"applicability\" of Article 3 (2) to Article 8, as the majority\u2019s decision contends.15 I will proceed then to examine the content of Article 3 (3) following the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which reflects the status of general international law in this field, as is widely agreed.\n\nInterim Award, para. 102.\n\n11.\n\nArticle 3 (3) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT is not drafted in an exemplary way.16 The reference to \"Articles 1 to 11\" has necessarily as a condition *the material and/or logical possibility* that paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 3 were indeed applicable to each of the aspects of these articles. It is apparent that many of Articles 1 to 11 are clearly not candidates for that. Furthermore, in some cases the attempt to apply them would even lead to ridiculous situations. Thus, it is very difficult to envisage the applicability of Article 3(1) and (2) to Article 1 (Definitions), obviously to Article 3 itself (!), to Article 4 (which contains its own autonomous similar clause), to Article 7 (which contains exceptions to the MFN Clause itself), to Article 9 (which establishes a dispute settlement provision *between the Contracting Parties* and is not relevant at all to MFN treatment to investments or investors clauses), and to Article 11 (which imposes the application of other Rules more favourable than those provided for by the BIT, among them obviously Article 3, rendering the application of the latter impossible). This (rather long) list of non-relevant articles notwithstanding their reference in paragraph (3) suffices to demonstrate that the mere inclusion of Article 8 in the general reference to \"Articles 1 to 11\" is not enough for assuming the applicability of the MFN clause of Article 3 (2) to Article 8.\n\nI am aware that other BITs use the same or similar formulas. I confine my analysis to the text of the treaty the Tribunal has to examine for the purposes of the case.\n\n12.\n\nAs the ILC Study Group Final Report has recognised:\n\nThere are certain parameters *(ratione materiae, ratione personae, ratione temporis* etc.) within which an MFN provision must operate, and thus the question becomes whether the conditions relating to access to dispute settlement are themselves a relevant parameter. The application of an MFN provision cannot be completely open-ended. As draft article 14 of the 1978 draft articles provides: \"The exercise of rights arising under a most-favoured-nation clause for the beneficiary State or persons or things in a determined relationship with that State is subject to compliance with the relevant terms and conditions laid down in the treaty containing the clause or otherwise agreed between the granting State and the beneficiary State.\" There is no doubt that if a State lias consented in a BIT to recognize certain categories of persons as investors, an MFN provision cannot be invoked to change those categories.17\n\nStudy Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, Final Report, Annex to the Report of the International Law Commission, *supra* footnote 14, p. 182, paras. 164-166 (footnotes omitted).\n\n13.\n\nArticle 3 (3) relates to *\"[t]he treatment* provided for *in paragraphs (1) and (2)\"* Some general observations can be taken from that limitation. First, it covers \"treatment\" with the scope of paragraphs (1) and (2). Second, this means also that in principle it covers not only MFN but also national treatment (hereinafter \"NT\") since both paragraphs (1) and (2) deal with both standards. Third, Article 3 (3) covers NT and MFN as regards \"investments\" (paragraph (1)) and \"investors\" (paragraph (2)). Fourth, it covers treatment \"in its territory\", a limitation that appears both in paragraphs (1) and (2).\n\n**B. The interpretation of Article 3 (2)**\n------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nI will focus on Article 3 (2) since the decision considered that \"MFN treatment can extend to dispute settlement provisions only through the operation of Article 3(2) of the Treaty. \u2018Investment' as such has no procedural rights, therefore Article 3(1) is without relevance for the purpose of the Tribunal's inquiry into its jurisdiction.\"18\n\nInterim Award, para. 104.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal should have examined the content of paragraph (2) in order to determine whether it is really possible to apply it to the provisions of Article 8. Unfortunately, it decided otherwise. It considers that since Article 8 refers to \"the right\" of investors, it is not necessary to analyse whether the word \"treatment\" in particular covers \"substantial rights\" and/or \"procedural rights\".19 However, not *all* rights conferred to investors by the BIT fall within the scope of Article 3 (2). I will then proceed to the interpretation to paragraph (2) starting with the ordinary meaning of its terms in their context.\n\nInterim Award, para. 102.\n\n16.\n\nFirst, Article 3 (2) refers to \"treatment\" \"as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments\". The question at issue is whether the right to resort to international arbitration falls under that \"treatment\". The text provides then a limitative list of treatments covered by the MFN clause. If the intention of the parties would have been to include *all* rights of the investors, there would have been no need to produce such a detailed list. It is my contention that the use of the word \"treatment\" is not appropriate to refer to the right to submit a dispute to international arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nIn *ICS v Argentina,* the Tribunal examined the scope of Article 3 (2) of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, which is similar to the text we examine in the present case. The Tribunal noted that \"[t]he formulation of Article 3(2) is also different and narrower in scope than clauses which provide for MFN treatment in relation to \u2018all matters' or \u2018all issues' relating to the BIT.\"20\" The Tribunal went on to state that \"[iInternational arbitration against the State is not a normal activity in the sense that it only happens, per *essence,* when disputes remain unsettled, unless one already takes for granted the existence of the BIT or of another agreement providing for international arbitration.\"21 The Tribunal also stated that \"[o]ther recent investment treaties have similarly included provisions explicitly indicating that this language intends to specifically limit the MFN clause to substantive treatment matters.\"22\n\n*ICS v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 299.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 300. See also *Wintershall v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, paras. 169-171.\n\n*ICS v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 302. See Chile-Colombia Free Trade Agreement (2006), Annex 9.3; Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (2008), Annex 804.1.\n\n18.\n\nSecondly, Article 3 includes in its MFN and NT provisions a limitation to treatment \"in its territory\". Many tribunals recognise that this kind of wording is a limitation to the MFN provision.23 In\u00a0*Berschader,* the Tribunal considered that the use of the expressions \"treatment\" and \"in its territory\" in the BIT \"appears to indicate that what the Contracting Parties had in view was the material rights accorded to investors within the territory of the Contracting States\" and what \"the Contracting Parties had in mind was a fairly standard form of MFN clause.\"24\n\n*Berschader* v *Russia, supra* footnote 6; *Impregilo* v *Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 100; *ICS* v *Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 305;*Daimler v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 226.\n\n*Berschader* v *Russia, supra* footnote 6, para. 185.\n\n19.\n\nIn *ICS,* the Tribunal determined that \"international arbitration is not an activity inherently linked to the territory of the respondent State. Just the contrary is true\".25 The Tribunal observed that \"[w]here an MFN clause applies only to treatment in the territory of the host State, the logical corollary is that treatment outside the territory of the host State does not fall within the scope of the clause.\"26 In *Daimler,* the decision followed a similar position as that in *ICS.27* In *ST-AD v Bulgaria* the Tribunal, relying in the *Daimler* award, considered that \"a reference to the words \"treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" cannot be reconciled with an international arbitral procedure, which is not rooted in the territory.\"28 By definition, international arbitration does not occur *in the territory!* of the Contracting State.\n\n*ICS v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 306.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 308.\n\n*Daimler v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, paras. 226-229.\n\n*ST-AD* v *Bulgaria, supra* footnote 6, para. 394.\n\n20.\n\nThe reference in paragraph (2) to the treatment accorded by the Contracting Party not only to nationals of third countries but of its *own nationals* also reinforces this interpretation, since it is apparent that nationals cannot invoke recourse to international arbitration against its own State.\n\n21.\n\nTo sum up, the meaning of \"the provisions of Articles Ito 11\" in context is simply \"the provisions of this treaty\".29 This general reference, as explained above, renders Article 3 (2) applicable to the other articles of the BIT *insofar as the material conditions envisaged in paragraph (2) are present in those articles.* In my view, for the reason already indicated, this is not the case with Article 8.\n\nThe only articles put aside in the description \"Articles 1 to 11\" are those relating to the entry into force and the duration and termination of the treaty.\n\n22.\n\nThe object and purpose of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT does not allow another interpretation of Article 3. The content of the treaty as well as its preamble show that its object and purpose is to promote and protect investment. The preamble also refers to the strengthening of ties of friendship, the extension and intensification of economic relations and the stimulation of flow of capital and technology and economic development of the parties. In the preamble, the parties also recognise that \"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable\". There is no reference to the establishment of international arbitration available for investors as a particular object and purpose of the treaty. As I will explain later, the protection of foreign investments does not necessarily entail the need to set up international arbitration.\n\n23.\n\nI concur with the 2015 *Final Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission on the Most-Favoured Nation Clause* when it states that \"whether MFN clauses are to encompass dispute settlement provisions is ultimately up to the States that negotiate such clauses. Explicit language can ensure that an MFN provision does or does not apply to dispute settlement provisions.\"30\" In my view, for the reasons set out above, the ill-defined formula of paragraph (3) does not settle the issue in and of itself. The required \"explicit language\" could have been found, for instance, if Article 3 (2) would have included \"dispute settlement\" in the enumeration of investors rights governed by the MFN clause, without any territorial limitation. No such reference is present.\n\nStudy Group on the Most-Favoetred-Nation Clause, Final Report, Annex to the Report of the International Law Commission, *supra* footnote 14, p. 190, para. 216.\n\n24.\n\nNevertheless, I will not close my analysis here since in my view, even following the interpretation that \"procedural rights\" are also included in the description of Article 3 (2), as the majority asserts, the outcome of the matter under examination in the instant case will be the same. Even assuming that the provision of Article 3 (2) would be applicable to Article 8, still there would be no jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* in the present circumstances. This is what I examine in the following section.\n\n**C. Even applying the MFN Clause to Article 8, there would be no jurisdiction ratione voluntatis**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nLet us assume that the MFN clause of Article 3 (2) applies to Article 8 of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT. Let us also assume that investors of Barbados would be offered the best treatment Venezuela would grant to investors of other States in other BITs and this would include the possibility to submit disputes to UNCITRAL arbitration, since, as the majority indicates, other BITs concluded by Venezuela and entered into force accept UNCITRAL as the default means of arbitration or even as the principal means. Still, this assertion does not solve the crucial point here: whether Venezuela consented to UNCITRAL arbitration for investors of Barbados. At the outset, it is interesting to notice that the *Final Report* of the ILC Study Group, while accepting *the possibility* of applying MFN provisions to dispute settlement provisions, did not examine the\u00a0*consequences* of the application of the MFN clause to those provisions. There is no reason to pre-judge that applying the MFN clause to dispute settlement provisions automatically creates a basis for jurisdiction.\n\n26.\n\nArticle 3 is a substantive provision containing MFN and NT *obligations,* i.e. how the Contracting Parties *must act* with regard to investments, returns and investors, neither establishing the settlement of disputes at the international level nor expressing consent to such settlement. In fact, Article 3 (2) obliges the parties to grant to particular activities of investors from the other party the most favourable treatment in their territory. Let us assume that this contains the \"procedural\" obligation by Venezuela to offer investors from Barbados the better dispute settlement mechanisms established in other BITs, as the majority believes.\n\n27.\n\nAssuming that investors from Barbados are entitled to benefit from the acceptance by Venezuela of UNCITRAL arbitration with regard to investors from third countries, yet the question of *compliance* with this obligation is still open. Having a right (or an obligation) is one thing, respect or otherwise for this right (or obligation) is quite another. To put it differently, even if Venezuela is obliged to grant to Barbadian investors the right granted to Ecuadorian investors to have access to UNCITRAL arbitration, the question is whether Venezuela has indeed implemented that right to Barbadian investors, by offering them such arbitration. This is the normal way rights emerging from MFN Clauses have always been interpreted and applied, and there is no reason to treat the obligation to grant investors access to international arbitration in another manner.31 MFN clauses may extend conventional rights and concomitant obligations, they cannot implement themselves the exercise of these rights or the execution of the concomitant obligations.\n\nSee, for example, *Parkerings-Compagniet AS* v *Lithuania,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/8, Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, 14 August 2007, paras. 366-376; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A v Pakistan,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/29, Award, 24 August 2009, paras. 417-420; *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Eromi) Kft* v *Hungary,* ICSID Case No ARB/07/22, Award, 17 September 2010, para. 12.3.2; *GIA Group Aktiengesellschaft* v *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, paras. 342-342; *Cargill, Inc* v *Mexico,*ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 13 August 2009, paras. 228-234; *Grand River Enterprises et al.* v **United States of America,** UNCITRAL, Award, 12 January 2011, paras. 158-172;*Convial Callao S.A. and CCI - Compania de Concesiones de Lnfraestructura S.A.* v. *Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/2, Award, 21 May 2013, paras. 663-668; *Apotex Holdings lnc. and Apotex Inc.* v **United States of America,** ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, paras. 8.59-8.78.\n\n28.\n\nOne of the contradictions in applying a MFN provision to issues of jurisdiction is that the Tribunal, instead of determining first that it has jurisdiction under the ISDS provision in the BIT and then analysing a claim of a breach under an MFN provision, has begun the analysis the other way around.\n\n29.\n\nArbitrator Christopher Thomas called that problem the \"sequential issue\". He explained it in the following way: \"Seeking the application of a particular rule of treatment in the Treaty in order to create jurisdiction seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse (...). A tribunal cannot adjudicate someone's rights if they have not met the threshold jurisdictional requirements to be able to claim such rights.\"32 The case concerned the use of a MFN clause in order to disregard the 18 months litigation period but the reasoning is entirely applicable here.33\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, Separate and Dissenting Opinion, paras. 81-82.\n\nSee also, Zachary Douglas, *The MFN Clause in Investment Arbitration: Treaty Interpretation Off the Rails, 2* Journal of International Dispute Settlement (2011), pp. 97-113.\n\n30.\n\nSimilarly, the majority in *Daimler* analysed the \"timing aspect of standing\" and questioned the moment when a MFN claim could be raised before an international arbitral tribunal.34 The majority noted that the fulfilment of the 18 month domestic courts submission constitutes a condition precedent to the host State's consent to submit a particular dispute to investor-State arbitration and, as a consequence, the issue of the MFN provision was not yet properly before the tribunal.35 The decision was supported by the reasoning of the ICJ in the *Anglo-Iranian Oil* case, where Iran's acceptance of the ICJ's jurisdiction over disputes arising under the two \"basic treaties\" (the Persia/United Kingdom treaties) was a condition precedent to the United Kingdom's standing to raise its MFN claims before the Court.36 Because this condition precedent had not been fulfilled, the UK had no standing and the ICJ had no jurisdiction.37\n\n*Daimler v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, paras. 199-204.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 200.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 201-203.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 203.\n\n31.\n\nSimilarly, in *ST-AD v Bulgaria,* the Tribunal considered:\n\nThe object and purpose of the BIT\u2019S MFN clause is to grant protected investors the most favourable treatment found in other BITs. But before being able to ask for a \"more favourable\" treatment, an investor has to already be subjected to what it considers to be a less favourable treatment and the conditions for access to a more favourable treatment through the MFN clause have to be satisfied. More specifically, before a tribunal can apply the MFN clause, (i) there must be a foreign investor (and the conditions for being considered as a foreign investor under the BIT cannot be modified by the MFN clause), (ii) there must be an investment (and the conditions for finding that an investment exists under the BIT cannot be modified by the MFN clause), (iii) the BIT must be applicable **ratione temporis** to the situation (and the conditions of application **ratione temporis** under the BIT cannot be modified by the MFN clause), and (iv) above all, the tribunal must have jurisdiction **ratione voluntatis** (and the conditions for access to jurisdiction **ratione voluntatis** under the BIT cannot be modified by the MFN clause).38\n\n*ST-AD* v *Bulgaria, supra* footnote 6, para. 344.\n\n32.\n\nIn short, MFN clauses do not possess the power *to express consent,* even though they would be able to impose *the obligation to consent* to international arbitration if their content allows so. To consider that it is possible to automatically enforce States' compliance with their obligations without their consent is something that the Security Council may be able to do in the exercise of its competencies in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter, but certainly not an arbitral tribunal. This would be more than extraordinary: it would disregard the basic principle of international adjudication, i.e. the principle of consent to jurisdiction.\n\n33.\n\nThe International Court of Justice is aware of this and it has consistently distinguished between what would be breaches to international obligations (even grave breaches) and the existence of jurisdiction. As the Court stated in the cases the then Federal Republic of Yugoslavia brought against NATO States: \"there is a fundamental distinction between the question of the acceptance by a State of the Court's jurisdiction and the compatibility of particular acts with international law; the former requires consent; the latter question can only be reached when the Court deals with the merits\".39\n\nSee for example *Legality of Use of Force (Yugoslavia* v *Canada), Provisional Measures, Order of 2 June 1999,* ICJ Reports 1999, p. 273, para. 43.\n\n34.\n\nThe same applies to international arbitration. Even if the situations are different, I believe that what the ICJ examined in its advisory opinion on the *Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania* is useful here. These three States had accepted arbitration for the settlement of disputes with the other Contracting Parties to the Peace Treaties. They had to appoint an arbitrator in order to allow the tribunal to be constituted. They did not. The question was whether the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who could appoint the third arbitrator, could also appoint the arbitrator not designed by the parties. The Court's answer was he could not.40\" Refusal to appoint their members to the Treaty Commissions by these three States would involve international responsibility for not having fulfilled a treaty obligation. However, the Commissions, whose jurisdiction was accepted by Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, could not be constituted without these three States acting in the manner prescribed by the Treaty. The question here is not the constitution of the tribunal (something Venezuela has accepted with the sole purpose to examine its jurisdiction and constantly stating that it has not consented to jurisdiction on the merits)41, but whether Venezuela has given its consent to settle the dispute raised by the Claimant through arbitration.\n\n*Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania,* Advisory Opinion (Second Phase), [1950] ICJ Reports 221, 228-229.\n\nSee Statement of Defence, 3 March 2014; Request for Bifurcation, 11 March 2014; Memorial, 11 April 2014; Reply, 30 May 2014; Hearing Transcript (in particular 10 July 2014, 10:6-10).\n\n35.\n\nAs such, assuming that by virtue of the MFN clause Venezuela is obliged to grant Barbadian investors access to an UNCITRAL arbitral tribunal, this Tribunal cannot go to the merits (or other exceptions with regard to jurisdiction or admissibility) if it is not demonstrated that Venezuela has given its consent and therefore has fulfilled its obligation stemming from Article 3 (2).\n\n36.\n\nThis interpretation is reinforced by other articles of the treaty. Article 8 (3) provides that \"the arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement\"42 As already mentioned, the MFN and NT provisions in Article 3 are substantive provisions containing obligations. Thus, the only thing a tribunal having jurisdiction could do as regards an article that provides for an obligation such as Article 3 is to determine whether there is a breach or not of that obligation. In other words, the Tribunal could not use an obligation for other purposes, such as creating *ratione voluntatis* jurisdiction.\n\nThis is similar to the texts of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 that provide that an investor may submit to arbitration a claim that another Party \"lias breached an obligation under... Section A\". Section A provides for the obligations as regards \"Investment\" including MFN and NT.\n\n37.\n\nTo sum up, if the Claimant considers that Venezuela has breached its obligations under Article 3 of the BIT, as indeed it does,43 this is a matter that a tribunal may only decide insofar as it has jurisdiction. Article 3 (2) does not contain at the same time an obligation, on the one hand, and the jurisdictional means to decide about its compliance or breach, on the other hand.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 87-89.\n\n38.\n\nHere, even assuming the applicability of Article 3 (2) to Article 8 of the BIT, there is a step that is lacking for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction. At this stage, it is crystal-clear that Venezuela has not given its consent to UNCITRAL arbitration for the case introduced by the Claimant. The majority is aware of this difficulty for justifying its decision. It tried to solve this rather insurmountable obstacle by finding an alleged permanent consent to UNCITRAL arbitration in Article 8 (4) of the BIT. In the next section, I will demonstrate that this consent does not exist.\n\n**III. UNDER ARTICLE 8 THERE IS NO OFFER OF UNCITRAL ARBITRATION TO WHICH THE MFN COULD BE APPLIED**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIn order to overcome the crucial lack of consent by Venezuela as regards UNCITRAL arbitration in the instant case, the majority makes in my view a serious misconstruction of Article 8 while trying to apply Article 3 (2) to it, for the reasons I will develop below. To facilitate the reading of this opinion, I recall here the content of Article 8:\n\n**Settlement of Disputes Between one Contracting Party and Nationals or Companies of the other Contracting Party**\n\n(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n(2) As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention as mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). If for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n(3) The arbitral award shall be limited to detennining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations lias caused damages to the national concerned, and if such is the case, the amount of compensation.\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n40.\n\nMy colleagues consider that the parties to the Barbados-Venezuela BIT have given unconditional consent to three types of arbitration: ICSID, Additional Facility and UNCITRAL, under certain conditions. They believe that this is the way to give effect to paragraph 4 of Article 8, which otherwise would \u2014 according to them \u2014 be repetitive and without any specific meaning.44 If another BIT offers a better condition for any of these three types of arbitration, then this other BIT can be invoked by a Barbadian investor. Since, following their reasoning, the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT institutes UNCITRAL arbitration in the event that *neither the Additional Facility nor ICSID is available,* then the Claimant may invoke UNCITRAL in this case.45\n\nInterim Award, para. 110\n\nInterim Award, para. 127.\n\n41.\n\nThis reasoning is very difficult to sustain. The terms of Article 8 (4) do not even open the door for any ambiguity: \"Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article\". Article 8 does not provide to investors of the other party *options* for having recourse to international arbitration. Article 8 does not establish *mere temporal conditions* for having recourse to one or the other of the three possibilities mentioned in paragraphs (1) and (2). Article 8 contains unconditional consent to international arbitration only to the extent of this article and nothing else. Instead of giving effect to paragraph 4 of Article 8, the majority deprives the last and very important part of the paragraph (\"in accordance with the provisions of this Article\") of any *effet utile.* In fact, as will be explained below, it deprives the entire Article 8 of its real content and scope.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal has unanimously found that at all stages there has been *just one kind of arbitration available* to the investors of the other country in the Barbados/Venezuela BIT: in the \"pre-ICSID period\", ICSID Additional Facility arbitration, and only if this was not available, UNCITRAL arbitration, and obviously only ICSID in the ICSID-period. In the post-ICSID period (after the Venezuelan withdrawal from the ICSID Convention), there is none.46 The majority's decision tries to bring back to life a consent to UNCITRAL arbitration that was envisaged at the time of the signature of the BIT (when Venezuela was not a party to the ICSID Convention) but that it *has never been available* because the BIT entered into force on 31 October 1995, *after the ICSID Convention entered into force for Venezuela* (on 1 June 1995). Article 3 (2) cannot operate with regard to UNCITRAL arbitration and allegedly improve the conditions of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT, simply because the possibility to have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration under this BIT has never existed. Investors from Barbados (or from Venezuela with regard to Barbados) only had at their disposal ICSID arbitration after the entry into force of the BIT and nothing else.\n\nInterim Award, para. 89.\n\n43.\n\nThe majority's interpretation also disregards the entire economy of Article 8. All the elements included in the four paragraphs of Article 8 form part of the \"standing offer\" agreed by the Contracting Parties. All of them play a clear and important role in that offer and cannot be separated from one another: Article 8 (1), in its first part, sets out the types of *disputes* that can be submitted to investor-State arbitration and, in its second part, envisages ICSID arbitration when the Contracting Parties are also Contracting States to the ICSID Convention; Article 8 (2) envisages arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules in the period during which Venezuela had not yet become a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules for the same period ji |f for any reason the Additional Facility is not available\"; Article 8 (3) establishes the limits of the arbitral award (i.e. determining a breach of the Agreement, the existence of damages and the amount of compensation); and finally Article 8 (4) establishes the Contracting Parties' \"unconditional consent\" to the submission of disputes \"in accordance with the provisions of this Article\".\n\n44.\n\nThe expression \"unconditional consent\" in Article 8 (4) refers to the fact that consent to arbitration included in the BIT is without any need of a further special agreement, in other words, indicating the Contracting Parties' advance consent to international arbitration.47 This expression cannot be interpreted as creating an \"overall\" \"offer to arbitrate\" as suggested by the majority. It follows that Article 8 (4) is not a \"standing offer\" to arbitrate by itself, but instead is part of the general offer to arbitrate included in Article 8. Article 8 (4), as one element of the offer to arbitration, remains as long as the conditions for the existence of an international arbitration set out in the other paragraphs also remain.\n\nAron Broches, *The Experience of the International Centre for Settlement of investment Disputes,* 20 STUDY IN TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL POLICY 75-97 1985, p. 83; *Churchill Mining PTC v Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Decision on jurisdiction, 24 February 2014, paras.198-199 and 203.\n\n45.\n\nToday, there is no current offer to arbitrate, because the only one that has ever existed once the BIT entered into force no longer exists after Venezuela's withdrawal from the ICSID Convention. The principle unanimously underlined by the Tribunal should apply: \"the MFN clause cannot serve the purpose of importing consent to arbitration when none exists under the BIT between Barbados and Venezuela.\"48 Other arbitral tribunals have previously applied this principle.49 The same reasoning should apply here where the offer to the only available arbitral means (ICSID) has disappeared and the one attempted by the Applicant (UNCITRAL arbitration) has\u00a0*never* been at its disposal.\n\nInterim Award, para. 105.\n\n*Hochtief* v *Argentina, supra* footnote 5, para. 79; *EURAM* v. *Slovak Republic, supra* footnote 6, para. 447.\n\n46.\n\nTo sum up, it is not exact to say that paragraph 4 would be deprived of any *effet utile* if it is not read as a \"standing offer\" to any of the three possibilities envisaged in Article 8. The added value of paragraph 4 that refers to \"unconditional consent\" is to indicate that there are no other conditions for international arbitration beyond those established in Article 8. Paragraph 4 is clear: it indicates that the acceptance by the parties of arbitration in the conditions set out in Article 8 is otherwise unconditional. Nothing else and nothing less.\n\n47.\n\nIt is true that, after the withdrawal of Venezuela from the ICSID Convention, there is no possibility for Barbadian investors (or for Venezuelan investors in Barbados) to have recourse to international arbitration. This is a consequence of the possibility by the parties to the ICSID Convention to withdraw from it, a right nobody denies. It is also true that Article 8 of the BIT is still in force. As it is the unanimous understanding of this Tribunal, the parties to the BIT did not envisage the situation of the withdrawal of one of them, or both, from the ICSID Convention, which was nevertheless an existing one. Under these circumstances, the \"standing offer\" of Article 8 will become operational if Venezuela becomes party to the ICSID Convention again and if Barbados does not withdraw from it in the meantime.\n\n48.\n\nThe right interpretation of the text of Article 8 (1) and (2) in their context made in Section A of Part V of the decision is then contradicted in Section B. It is a serious mistake to consider that the three different arbitral proceedings mentioned in those paragraphs are simply subject to \"temporal conditions\"50, as though all of them were available. A temporal condition exists for example when the possibility to start arbitral proceedings is subject to the passing of a certain period of time after the end of another dispute settlement means (negotiations, domestic judicial proceedings, etc.). In the Barbados-Venezuela BIT each of the three arbitral proceedings are submitted to a condition subsequent *(condici\u00f3n resolutiva)',* the Additional Facility arbitration, until the entry into force of the ICSID Convention to Venezuela; UNCITRAL Rules arbitration, until the same action and only if for any reason the Additional Facility was not available during that period; ICSID arbitration, after the entry into force of the ICSID Convention and insofar as this Convention is in force between the parties. The Interim Award does not take into account this important difference between a mere \"temporal condition\" and the determination of the existence of a given situation, such as the entry into force of a convention or the availability of a given arbitral procedure. By doing so, the Interim Award goes far beyond any other decision in extending the scope of consent through a MFN clause.\n\nInterim Award, paras. 113, 115.\n\n49.\n\nThe object and purpose of the BIT does not allow a different interpretation to that followed in this opinion. As we saw above, the Barbados-Venezuela BIT does not include the establishment of international arbitration for investors/State dispute settlement as a particular object and purpose of the treaty. The promotion and protection of foreign private investment does not necessarily require the establishment of international arbitration at the disposal of investors as an inherent and indispensable element of BITs, as international conventional practice in general and contracts concluded between foreign investors and States demonstrate. Many of them do not establish international arbitration and constitute nevertheless BITs or contracts providing for other dispute settlement mechanisms, including domestic fora. Hence, the object and purpose of the BIT does not allow an interpretation of Article 8 as establishing that States parties consent to international arbitration with investors in other circumstances than those established in the Article itself.\n\n50.\n\nFor the abovementioned reasons, the interpretation of Article 8 by the majority in Part V.B of the Award goes far beyond the text in its context and finds no support in the object and purpose of the BIT either. The choice of the parties of ICSID arbitration as its preferred mechanism is without any doubt. As is the fact that UNCITRAL arbitration was conceived as a second best before the entry into force of the ICSID Convention between the parties and only if the Additional Facility would not have been available, a double condition that has never existed since the very entry into force of the BIT, as explained above.\n\n51.\n\nWhat  Professor Laurence Boisson de Chazoumes stated in *Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan* is also relevant in the present case:\n\nthe so-called \u2018right\u2019 to a more favourable treatment under Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT can only be exercised if the foreign investor and the host state are subject to a dispute settlement relationship under one of the dispute settlement options that are provided in Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. In that sense, the application of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT is *subordinated* or *conditioned* to the prior application of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.51\n\n*Garanti Koza v Turkmenistan, supra* footnote 10, Statement of Dissent by Prof. Laurence Boisson de Chazoumes, paras. 40-41.\n\n52.\n\nThe decision in *Maffezini* also clearly stated that \"if the agreement provides for a particular arbitration forum, such as ICSID, for example, this option cannot be changed by invoking the clause, in order to refer the dispute to a different system of arbitration\".52 This reasoning should apply with greater force in the present situation, when there is not even an available offer to arbitrate, after Venezuela\u2019s withdrawal from ICSID.\n\n*Maffezini v Spain, supra* footnote 5, para. 63.\n\n53.\n\nTo sum up, the situation of Article 8 does not allow the establishment of consent to UNCITRAL arbitration on the basis of the application of Article 3(2) to it: there is no procedural relationship to which the most favourable treatment of another BIT can be applied.\n\n**IV. CONCLUSION**\n------------------\n\n54.\n\nIt is very regrettable that the majority decided not to follow what is a clear position sustained by different investment arbitral tribunals in not importing consent when none exists.53 The majority, in spite of an explicit assertion to the contrary, has done so. It did it through a complicated, extensive and wrong assimilation of a provisional, limited and never active consent to UNCITRAL arbitration in the Barbados-Venezuela BIT from the existing consent of UNCITRAL arbitration in other BITs which are still in force.\n\nSee *Maffezini* v *Spain, supra* footnote 5,paras. *62-63**:* *Plama v Bulgaria,* supra footnote 10,para. *207**.Roslnvest.* v *Russia,* Arbitration under Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award on Jurisdiction of October 2007, paras. 129-130; *National Grid* v *Argentina,* UNCITRAL Case, Decision on Jurisdiction of 20 June 2006, para. 92; *Hochtief v Argentina, supra* footnote 5, paras. 79-82; *Euram* v *Slovak Republic, supra* footnote 6, para. 447.\n\n55.\n\nIt is to be expected that the determination of jurisdiction by an *ad hoc* tribunal must be established in a fully conclusive manner. To use the words of the ICJ, the existence and scope of jurisdiction must be\u00a0*certain*,54 Unfortunately, this is not the case here.\n\n*Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v France),* Judgment of 4 June 2008, ICJ General List No. 136, para. 62.\n\n56.\n\nThis decision to extend even further the application of a MFN clause to a situation in which no international arbitration is available in the BIT concerned is even more regrettable when practice shows the discontent of States to the extensive interpretations of these clauses through their application to ISDS made by some tribunals. This situation has led to the emergence of interpretative declarations or the inclusion of interpretative provisions in order to avoid arbitral misrepresentation of the MFN clauses. I will just give as an example the recent Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) of 29 February 2016. Its Article 8.7 contains the following paragraph 4:\n\nFor greater certainty, the \"treatment\" referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 does not include procedures for the resolution of investment disputes between investors and states provided for in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements. Substantive obligations in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements do not in themselves constitute \"treatment\", and thus cannot give rise to. a breach of this Article, absent measures adopted or maintained by a Party pursuant to those obligations.55\n\nAvailable at: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc 154329.pdf (last visited 8 July 2016).\n\n57.\n\nAs the Final Report of the ILC Study Group observed, \"The application of MFN clauses to dispute settlement provisions in investment treaty arbitration, rather than limiting them to substantive obligations, brought a new dimension to thinking about MFN provisions and *perhaps consequences that had not been foreseen by parties when they negotiated their investment agreements.\"*56\n\nStudy Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, final Report, Annex to the Report of the International Law Commission,*supra* footnote 14, p. 190, para. 215 (emphasis added).\n\n58.\n\nThe majority of this Tribunal decided to go even further and bring back to life consent to an arbitral means that had since disappeared, and which has never been applicable. As explained in this opinion, Article 3 (2) cannot be applied to Article 8, despite the provision of Article 3 (3). Even if it were, the consequence would be the obligation for Venezuela to give consent. The possibility to examine whether Venezuela complied with this obligation is not open to this Tribunal. Venezuela\u2019s consent to arbitration is lacking. Furthermore, neither the Additional Facility nor UNCITRAL arbitration had never been available to investors because the ICSID Convention entered into force between the parties before the entry into force of their BIT. For them, this very fact renders the applicability of the MFN clause impossible.\n\n59.\n\nThe way to promote the acceptance of, recourse to and reliance on international investment, arbitration is not by imposing it without the fundamental requirement of State consent. On the contrary, this would only serve to undermine its credibility."}], "Content": "Interim Award on Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n**I.

Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC as the first arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 13 June 2013, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"PCA\") designate an appointing authority pursuant to Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules (2010).\n\n7.\n\nOn 16 July 2013, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated Professor Piero Bernardini as appointing authority.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 17 July 2013, the Claimant requested that Professor Bernardini appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n9.\n\nBy e-mail of 1 August 2013, the Respondent advised that it had appointed the law firm of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP to represent it in this case and that the Parties had agreed to a two-week extension of time for the Respondent to make an appointment.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 5 August 2013, the Respondent appointed Mr. Gabriel Bottini as the second arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 13 November 2013, pursuant to the agreement of the Parties, H.E. Judge Peter Tomka was appointed as the Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n**C.** Initial Procedural Steps\n-------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 4 December 2013, the Tribunal circulated a Draft Terms of Appointment to the Parties for their comments.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 13 December 2013, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Draft Terms of Appointment and asserted that the UNCITRAL Rules (1976) were applicable to the proceedings. By letter of the same date, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Draft Terms of Appointment and acknowledged that the original UNCITRAL Rules (1976) were applicable and would govern the arbitration in lieu of the revised UNCITRAL Rules (2010) under which it had commenced the arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 18 December 2013, the Tribunal issued a final version of the Terms of Appointment, which were subsequently executed by the Parties and the Tribunal (the last signature being on 9 January 2014), and circulated a Draft Procedural Order No. 1 for the Parties\u2019 comments.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 7 January 2014, the Claimant provided its comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1 and proposed a procedural calendar for the initial phase of the arbitration. By e-mail dated 8 January 2014, the Respondent provided its comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1. By letter dated 9 January 2014, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties\u2019 comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 1 and invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent\u2019s proposed modifications to the draft order. By letter dated 15 January 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments on Respondent\u2019s proposed modifications to Draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 January 2014, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim (the **\"Statement of Claim\").**\n\n17.\n\nOn 24 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n18.\n\nOn 3 March 2014, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defense (the **\"Statement of Defense\"),** in which it raised objections to jurisdiction and requested the bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n**D.** Bifurcation of the Proceedings\n-------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 7 March 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make submissions on whether to bifurcate the proceedings and whether to hold an in-person procedural meeting to discuss the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation and the timetable for the proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nBy e-mail of 11 March 2014, the Respondent conveyed a request on behalf of both Parties that the Tribunal hold a procedural meeting in person.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Respondent submitted a request for bifurcation of the proceedings (the **\"Request for Bifurcation\")** asking the Tribunal to rule upon its first jurisdictional objection relating to the lack of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* as a preliminary matter.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 12 March 2014, the Tribunal confirmed that a procedural meeting would be held in person on 19 March 2014 at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 14 March 2014, the Claimant agreed to the bifurcation of the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* and proposed a timetable for bifurcated proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nBy e-mail of 14 March 2014, the Respondent notified the Tribunal and the Claimant of a challenge to Mr. Fortier under Articles 10 and 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules for lack of independence and impartiality and requested that the procedural meeting scheduled for 19 March 2014 be postponed.\n\n25.\n\nBy separate e-mail and letter dated 14 March 2014, the Claimant raised certain concerns regarding the disclosures made by Mr. Bottini with his statement of independence and impartiality, and opposed the Respondent\u2019s request to postpone the procedural meeting.\n\n26.\n\nThe Parties exchanged further correspondence on whether to postpone the procedural meeting including the Respondent\u2019s further e-mail of 14 March 2014, the Claimant\u2019s e-mail of 15 March 2014, the Respondent\u2019s e-mail of 16 March 2014, and the Claimant\u2019s e-mail of 16 March 2014.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 16 March 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator acknowledged the Parties\u2019 agreement to bifurcate the Respondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection and decided, subject to subsequent revision by the full Tribunal, to cancel the proposed procedural meeting and to establish a procedural calendar for the preliminary jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.\n\n**E.** Jurisdictional Phase\n---------------------------\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 17 March 2014, following the Claimant\u2019s indication that it did not agree to the challenge and Mr. Fortier\u2019s refusal to withdraw, the Respondent submitted the challenge to Professor Bernardini for a decision pursuant to Article 12 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated 19 March 2014, Mr. Bottini provided further clarifications regarding his declaration of impartiality and independence.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 25 March 2014, Professor Bernardini resigned as appointing authority.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter dated 28 March 2014, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA designate a substitute appointing authority to decide the challenge to Mr. Fortier.\n\n32.\n\nOn 4 April 2014, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated Mr. Jemej Sekolec as appointing authority.\n\n33.\n\nOn 11 April 2014, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on the Objection to the Jurisdiction *Ratione Voluntatis* of the Tribunal (the **\"Memorial\").**\n\n34.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Respondent\u2019s Objection to the Jurisdiction *Ratione Voluntatis* of the Tribunal (the **\"Counter-Memorial\").**\n\n35.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, the Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on the Objection to the Jurisdiction *Ratione Voluntatis* of the Tribunal (the **\"Reply\").**\n\n36.\n\nOn 2 June 2014, Mr. Sekolec issued a decision in his capacity as appointing authority rejecting the challenge to Mr. Fortier.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated 5 June 2014, the Tribunal scheduled a Hearing on Jurisdiction, to be held on 10 July 2014 at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 June 2014, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder Memorial on the Objection to the Jurisdiction *Ratione Voluntatis* of the Tribunal (the **\"Rejoinder\").**\n\n39.\n\nOn 10 July 2014, the Hearing on Jurisdiction was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands. The following persons were present:\n\n**Tribunal**\n\nH.E. Judge Peter Tomka (Presiding Arbitrator)\n\nThe Honourable L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC Mr. Gabriel Bottini\n\n**Claimant**\n\nMr. John P.

RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n----------------------------------\n\n**A.** The Treaty\n-----------------\n\n45.\n\nThe dispute to be decided in the present phase of the proceedings concerns whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the claims contained in the Statement of Claim. The Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claims \"for lack of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis\"*,2 The Claimant maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits and requests the Tribunal to dismiss \"[t]he Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal for lack of consent.\"3 The resolution of this disagreement between the Parties depends on the proper interpretation of Article 8 of the Treaty, containing the relevant dispute settlement provisions and, depending on the conclusion the Tribunal will reach, possibly also on the application of Article 3 of the Treaty, containing a Most Favored Nation (\"MFN\") clause.\n\nReply, \u00b6 71.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b649.\n\n46.\n\nArticle 8 provides as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE 8**\n\n**Settlement of Disputes Between one Contracting Party and Nationals or Companies of the other Contracting Party**\n\n(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n(2) As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention as mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). If for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n(3) The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national concerned, and if such is the case, the amount of compensation.\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n47.\n\nArticle 3 reads as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE 3**\n\n**National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Provisions**\n\n(1) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own nationals or companies or to investments or returns of nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n(3) The treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.\n\n**B.** Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn addition to the relevant provisions of the Treaty, it is instructive to reproduce here the rules on the interpretation of treaties set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"VCLT\"), which both Parties acknowledge govern the interpretation of the Treaty:\n\n*Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n*Article 32*\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, while Barbados is a Party to the VCLT, having ratified it on 24 June 1971, Venezuela is not a Party to it and has not even signed it. But it is now well accepted that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT on interpretation of treaties codify customary rules of international law. In other words, these Articles reflect customary international law, as confirmed on various occasions by the International Court of Justice.4\n\nSee e.g. *LaGrand (Germany* v. *United States of America),* Judgment, 27 June 2001, 2001ICJ REPORTS 466, \u00b6 99; *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina* v. *Serbia and Montenegro),* 2007 ICJ REPORTS 43, 160.\n\n**IV. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n**A.** Respondent\u2019 **s** request for relief\n-------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to grant the following relief:\n\nRespondent respectfully submits that all claims contained in the Statement of Claim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* and that this Tribunal should allocate the costs of these proceedings to Claimant.5\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 35; Reply, \u00b6 71.\n\n**B.** Claimant\u2019s request for relief\n------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\nFor the reasons stated above and in Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal for lack of consent should be dismissed, and this arbitration should proceed on the merits.6\n\nRejoinder, 49. See also Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 66.\n\n**V. ISSUES ON JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A.** Interpretation of Article **8** of the Treaty\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* of the Tribunal on the basis that Article 8 of the Treaty does not provide a valid and effective consent to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules in the circumstances of the present case. While the Respondent has given its \"unconditional consent\" to arbitration in Article 8(4) of the Treaty, it has only done so \"in accordance with the provisions of this Article\", which limited its consent to UNCITRAL arbitration to a specific brief period that has long passed.7\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 4; Reply, \u00b6\u00b68-10. The Respondent adds that the \"unconditional\" formulation used in Article 8(4) was merely intended to implement the concept of \"arbitration without privity\". Reply, \u00b6 10. See also Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 19:12-21:15.99:2-21.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"the text and structure of Article 8(2) make it evident that the right to resort to UNCITRAL arbitration was provided only to cover a potential gap in the availability of ICSID jurisdiction under Article 8(1) that might exist \u2018 [a]s long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention\u2019 and \u2018[i]f for any reason the [ICSID] Additional Facility is not available.\u2019\"8 The Respondent explains that \"the possibility of such a gap existed in July 1994, when the Treaty was executed, because while Barbados and Venezuela had both signed the ICSID Convention, the latter had not yet become a Contracting Party which would be subject to ICSID arbitration upon entry into force of the Treaty.\"9 Upon Venezuela\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention, the above-mentioned interim period ended and Article 8(2) of the Treaty ceased to be applicable.10\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 4; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 11:4-16, 13:11-16:21.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 4; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 11:17-12:8.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b64-8. The Respondent clarifies that the potential interim period contemplated in Article 8(2) never actually came into existence, since Venezuela\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention became effective (in June 1995) prior to the entry into force of the Treaty (in October 1995).\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Parties agree that Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention on 24 January 2012 rendered ICSID arbitration under Article 8(1) unavailable.11 The Parties further agree that ICSID Additional Facility arbitration under Article 8(2) ceased to be available upon Venezuela\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention in 1995.12 The Claimant nevertheless seeks to avail itself of UNCITRAL arbitration under the second sentence of Article 8(2), which reads \"[i]f for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\"13\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 10, citing Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b624-25; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 10:25-11:3.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 11, citing Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b624-25.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 12.\n\n55.\n\nHowever, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the only reasonable interpretation of Article 8(2) of the Treaty is that the entire paragraph was intended to apply only during the pre-ICSID interim period. In particular, the Respondent asserts that the specific reference to the ICSID Additional Facility in this second sentence links it to the pre-ICSID period described in the first sentence.14 According to the Respondent, there was significant uncertainty at the time that the Treaty was entered into as to whether the ICSID Additional Facility would continue or be terminated. In addition, the rules of the Additional Facility remained untested and subject to possible modification, the first case under those rules not having been brought until 1997.15\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 13; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 15; Reply, \u00b6 21, citing Antonio R. Parra, New *Amendments of the Regulations and Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes* 19(2) NEWS FROM ICSID 1, p. 10 (RLA-39).\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent supports its interpretation by reference to the \"ordinary contextual interpretation\" of treaty terms called for in Article 31(1) of the VCLT and endorsed by international courts and tribunals.16 This interpretation is also supported by the principles of integration and contemporaneity in treaty interpretation,17 as well as the object and purpose of the provision in providing an alternative arbitral forum only for the brief period before Venezuela became an ICSID Contracting State.18 The Respondent adds that, given that the ordinary meaning of the terms taken in context is clear, there is no need for resort to further supplementary means of interpretation.19\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b618-21; Reply, \u00b6\u00b615-17, citing VCLT, Article 31(1) (\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose\"); Sir Humphrey Waldock, Special Rapporteur, *Third Report on the Law of Treaties,*A/CN.4/167, II YEARBOOK OF THE ILC 5 (1964), p. 54 (RLA-44); *Plama Consortium Limited v.

The Respondent contends that \"[i]f the Contracting Parties to the Treaty had intended to include UNCITRAL arbitration as a \u2018catch-all\u2019 arbitration option for those cases in which neither ICSID nor the ICSID Additional Facility were available, they would have referred to both ICSID and the ICSID Additional Facility and would have included this option in a new Article 8(3) or otherwise separated it from the ICSID and ICSID Additional Facility provisions, as other Venezuelan BITs do.\"20 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s interpretation implies that UNCITRAL arbitration would have become equally available alongside ICSID arbitration upon Venezuela\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention, which clearly was not intended.21 The Respondent also contrasts the instant Treaty with various other Venezuelan BITs which either (i) provide for ICSID arbitration22 (and sometimes also for ICSID Additional Facility arbitration in the interim),23 but do not contain an alternative arbitral forum in the event that one of the contracting parties withdraws from ICSID,24 or (ii) clearly include UNCITRAL arbitration as a default, catch-all option in a separate subsection or paragraph.25 A number of authorities, the Respondent submits, endorse the comparison of similar treaties concluded by the Contracting Parties as a useful supplementary means to clarify a treaty text.26\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 23; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 15:17-17:25, 30:14-37:12, 89:20-90:15.97:23-99:1.\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 90:16-92:24.\n\nE.g.

Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Venezuela has provided, in Article 8(4) of the Treaty, its \"express, irrevocable, and unconditional consent\" to arbitrate disputes arising under the Treaty.34 This essential consent to arbitration, the Claimant asserts, cannot be negated by any uncertainty regarding the subsidiary procedural question of which forum and rules apply to a particular dispute.35 In any event, the Claimant submits that the text and structure of Article 8 of the Treaty demonstrates that Venezuela consented to submit disputes to UNCITRAL arbitration. According to the Claimant, if the Respondent\u2019s interpretation were adopted, it would render the whole of Article 8 ineffective, contrary to the Contracting Parties\u2019 intent and the object and purpose of the Treaty. As such, the Claimant contends that it cannot be accepted as a good faith interpretation of the Treaty.36\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b619-11; Rejoinder, 12-13.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 10, citing *Garant\u00ed Koza LLP v.

In accordance with Article 8(1), ICSID arbitration is the applicable dispute settlement mechanism as long as both Parties are Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. Article 8(2) provides that, for the initial period until Venezuela became an ICSID Contracting State, disputes would be submitted to the ICSID Additional Facility. Finally, Article 8(2) also provides that \"[i]f for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the [UNCITRAL] rules\". In this case, given Venezuela\u2019s ratification (in 1995) and subsequent denunciation of the ICSID Convention (in 2012), arbitration under both the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules is unavailable. As such, in the Claimant\u2019s view, investors have the right to submit their disputes to UNCITRAL arbitration.37 The Claimant stresses that, unlike the claimant in *Nova Scotia Power v. Venezuela* or the other cases on which Venezuela relies, this is not a case where the Claimant has failed to observe the hierarchy of arbitral fora or failed to comply with mandatory pre-conditions to arbitration.38\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 2-6, 14-17; Rejoinder, \u00b6 15; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 54:11-57:10.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, referring to *Nova Scotia Power Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* UNCITRAL/PCA Case No. 2009-14, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2010 (RLA-25).\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its interpretation is supported by the ordinary meaning of the terms used in Article 8. The terms \"unconditional consent\" in Article 8(4), and \"for any reason\" and \"shall have the right\" in Article 8(2), clearly establish that UNCITRAL arbitration is a comprehensive and mandatory fail-back option which \"is not conditioned or limited by whether Venezuela ratified or withdrew from the ICSID Convention.\"39 In particular, the Claimant points out that the Contracting Parties added the otherwise superfluous phrase \"for any reason\" into the phrase \"if for any reason the Additional Facility is not available\" (emphasis added)40 By contrast, in the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation \"improperly conflates the two separate sentences of Article 8.2 to import a temporal limitation from the first sentence as a condition on the effect of the second\", leaving the phrases \"for any reason\" and \"shall have the right\", as well as the rest of the context of the provision, without meaning or effect41\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 23-29; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 14-17 citing *Garanti Koza v.

According to the Claimant, the phrase \"in accordance with the provisions of this article\" included in Article 8(4) merely refers to (i) the types of disputes that can be settled through arbitration as defined in Article 8(1); (ii) the procedural rules which will govern such arbitrations as referred to in Article 8(1) and (2), and (iii) the permitted scope of the arbitral award as set forth in Article 8(3). The Claimants therefore assert that Article 8(4) cannot be construed as imposing conditions that eliminate the right to international arbitration as a whole.

For example, the Claimant states that the Portugal-Venezuela BIT\u2019s article on investor-State dispute settlement does not contain an express statement of the States\u2019 consent to arbitration and includes all of the provisions for submission to ICSID, ICSID Additional Facility, and - if these are unavailable - UNCITRAL arbitration in the same sub-paragraph.44 Article 8 of the Czech Republic-Venezuela BIT includes a provision for negotiation, a reference to ICSID arbitration and a secondary reference to the Additional Facility in a single paragraph rather than in separate paragraphs.45 The dispute settlement clause of the Canada-Venezuela BIT sets out very detailed limitations, conditions, and procedural prerequisites restricting the States\u2019 consent to arbitration and omits the Barbados-Venezuela\u2019s wording of \"for any reason\" and \"shall have the right\" or any equivalent broad language.46 These examples, according to the Claimant, contradict the Respondent\u2019s assertions that, where an UNCITRAL fallback option is included, it is always set out in a separate section or paragraph, that the inclusion of the \"for any reason\" and \"shall have the right\" language is not significant, and that statements of unconditional consent to arbitration are included as a matter of course.47\n\nPortugal-Venezuela BIT, Article 8(2) (RLA-37):  \nIf the dispute cannot be resolved through amicable means within a term of six months, counted from the beginning of these consultations, it may be submitted, at the choice of the investor:  \na) To the local courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made; or  \nb) To the arbitration of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Washington Convention of March 18, 1965, in the event that both Contracting Parties are members of the same, or, if such is the case, to the rules governing the additional facility for the administration of reconciliation, arbitration and fact-finding proceedings by the Secretariat of ICSID.  \nIf, for whatever reason, neither ICSID nor the additional facility is available, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of arbitration of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\nCzech Republic-Venezuela BIT, Article 8 (RLA-34):\n\nCanada-Venezuela BIT, Article XII(4) (RLA-33).\n\nRejoinder, 27. The Claimant also points to various additional differences in these and other Venezuelan BITs cited by the Respondent. See Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, Article IX(3) (RLA-35); Lithuania-Venezuela BIT, Article 7 (RLA-36); Uruguay-Venezuela BIT, Article 9 (RLA-38); Iran-Venezuela BIT, Article 11(2) (RLA-26); Russia-Venezuela BIT (RLA-27), Article 9(2); Venezuela-Belarus BIT, Article 8(2) (C-37); Venezuela-Cuba BIT, Article 9(3) (C-38); Venezuela-Vietnam BIT, Article 8(2) (C-39).\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the Respondent\u2019s explanation of the reasons for including the UNCITRAL option. The ICSID Administrative Council decided to continue the ICSID Additional Facility indefinitely in 1984, over a decade before the conclusion of the Treaty.48 The Claimant further posits that \"Venezuela\u2019s scenario suggests that Barbados and Venezuela were concerned enough about the possibility that an investor might be left without an arbitral forum during the interim period between when Venezuela signed the BIT and when it became an ICSID Contracting State that they not only included the Additional Facility as a temporary, conditional alternative forum to ICSID, but also included UNCITRAL as a conditional, temporary, fail-back alternative to the alternative of the Additional Facility. And yet, under this scenario, the Contracting Parties were ostensibly not concerned with the possibility that at some time during the minimum ten-year term of the BIT, ICSID might not be available, leaving investors without any arbitral forum and Article 8 a nullity.\"49 The Claimant asserts that it is far more likely that the Contracting Parties intended the UNCITRAL option as a comprehensive default arbitral forum.50\n\nCounter-Memorial, 31; Rejoinder, 23. The Claimant adds that the Additional Facility is not a separate entity within ICSID, but is instead an alternative set of rules \"authorizing the ICSID Secretariat to administer certain types of proceedings between States and foreign nationals which fall outside the scope of the Convention.\" ICSID website: http://icsid.worldbank.org/ \"About ICSID, Dispute Settlement Facilities\" (last visited June 16, 2014).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 32; Rejoinder, \u00b6 24.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 32; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014) 65:14-66:14.\n\n67.\n\nAdditionally, in the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s construction of Article 8 also runs counter to the requirements of good faith interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT. The provision of a direct right of investors to arbitrate against the host State is, according to the Claimant, one of the main aims of the Treaty, and of BITs in general. However, seeing as Venezuela\u2019s withdrawal from the ICSID Convention has foreclosed the option of ICSID arbitration, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation would deprive Barbadian investors of any arbitral forum whatsoever in which to seek to enforce the Treaty\u2019s substantive provisions. This would, the Claimant asserts, defeat the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose51 and render the whole of Article 8 a dead letter, in violation of the interpretive principle of *ut res magis valeat quam pereat* (alternatively known as *effet utile)* embodied in Article 31(1) of the VCLT.52 It would also be an absurd and unreasonable result contrary to Article 32 of the VCLT.53 Moreover, the Claimant argues that \"a State should not be allowed to frustrate the investor\u2019s access to arbitration to redress treaty violations through a restrictive construction of the consent to arbitration provisions and its own acts in hindrance of that access.\"54 The Claimant also points to the case of *Lemire v. Ukraine* as a prime example of a tribunal not allowing supervening legal developments to defeat the true intent of Contracting Parties, notwithstanding an imprecise arbitration clause.55 The Claimant stresses the seriousness of the present dispute and argues that Venezuela should similarly not be allowed to advance opportunistic interpretations of the Treaty in order to deny the Claimant a right to international arbitration and evade its substantive obligations under the Treaty, as it has systematically done with other foreign investors as well.56\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 69:10-74:9, 124:7-125:8.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 20-22, 37-43; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 28-38, citing *Murphy v.

It contends that Venezuela, through Article 8 of the Treaty, \"irrevocably consented to arbitration of disputes between it and nationals or companies of Barbados who invested in Venezuela\".57\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b622.\n\n69.\n\nMeanwhile, the Respondent disputes the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case, as in the Respondent\u2019s view, its consent to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules ceased to be applicable.\n\n70.\n\nTo resolve the dispute on jurisdiction, the Tribunal has to interpret Article 8 of the BIT, the full text of which is reproduced above.58 It consists of four paragraphs. The Parties\u2019 arguments addressed in particular three of them, namely paragraphs 1, 2 and 4. It seems that paragraph 3 of Article 8, describing what the Tribunal has to determine in its award, is, except insofar as it provides relevant context for the interpretation of the other three paragraphs of the article, of no particular relevance for the task of the Tribunal at the present stage of the proceedings.\n\nSee *supra* \"The Treaty\", Section III. A,\u00b6 45.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore focus its attention on paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 in order to determine whether they provide a basis for its jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate the Claimant\u2019s claim.\n\n72.\n\nThe consent of Venezuela and Barbados to the submission of investment disputes by nationals of the other Party to international arbitration is expressed in Article 8(4) which reads as follows:  \nEach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n73.\n\nThis paragraph refers to the other provisions of the same Article as regards the category of disputes which may be submitted to international arbitrations, as well as the available arbitral fora.\n\n74.\n\nParagraph 1 defines the disputes as the ones between a Contracting Party and a national or a company of the other Party concerning the investment. It envisages ICSID as the appropriate arbitral forum for resolution of such disputes. It is useful to quote paragraph 1 again. It reads as follows:  \n Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the [ICSID] Convention.\n\n75.\n\nFor the Centre to have jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the State which is a party to the dispute and the State whose national is a party to the dispute, must both be Contracting States to the ICSID Convention. As long as this condition is not fulfilled, the Centre has no jurisdiction, even if the applicable BIT in force provides for resolution of investment disputes before a Tribunal to be constituted under the ICSID Convention.\n\n76.\n\nBarbados signed the ICSID Convention on 13 May 1981, ratified it on 1 November 1983, and it entered into force in relation to this State on 1 December 1983. Since then Barbados has been a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention on 18 August 1993, deposited its instrument of ratification on 2 May 1995, and it entered into force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995. On 24 January 2012, Venezuela notified the depositary of the denunciation of the ICSID Convention. This denunciation took effect, in accordance with Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, on 25 July 2012.\n\n77.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that arbitration under the ICSID Convention was not available before Venezuela became bound by the ICSID Convention on 1 June 1995 and is no longer available after Venezuela ceased to be bound by it on 25 July 2012.\n\n78.\n\nBarbados and Venezuela negotiated the Treaty in the early nineties and signed it on 15 July 1994, which is after Venezuela signed the ICSID Convention, but before it deposited its instrument of ratification in May 1995. This explains the inclusion of paragraph 2 in Article 8. That paragraph reads as follows:  \n As long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention as mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, disputes as referred to in that paragraph shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional Facility Rules). If for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n79.\n\nThe insertion of this paragraph into Article 8 shows, in the view of the Tribunal, that the Parties wished to have an arbitral forum available immediately from the moment of the BIT\u2019s entry into force even if the ICSID Convention did not yet bind Venezuela.\n\n80.\n\nThe Parties differ on the interpretation and import of this paragraph.\n\n81.\n\nVenezuela contends that paragraph 2 is limited to the temporary period before it became Party (\"a Contracting State\") to the ICSID Convention. Only for that period, the argument goes, did it consent to the settlement of a dispute between it and a Barbadian investor through a tribunal established and acting under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility. And only if the Additional Facility, during that pre-ICSID period for Venezuela, was not available for any reason, had Venezuela - according to its interpretation of the provision - consented to the submission of the dispute to arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules. Venezuela denies that the provision expresses its consent to have recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules in the period after it denounced the ICSID Convention in 2012.\n\n82.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, UNCITRAL arbitration was not only available in the pre-ICSID period, but is also available now, in the post-ICSID period, after Venezuela withdrew from the ICSID Convention. In support of its interpretation, the Claimant invokes the purposes of the BIT, one of which - in its contention - is to provide access to international arbitration. Further support is sought by the Claimant in paragraph 4 of Article 8 of the Treaty, according to which \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article\".\n\n83.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, effect should be given to the text of paragraph 2 in its totality, in the context in which it is placed within Article 8. The text is supposed to express the intention of the Contracting Parties when they agreed on it. The introductory words of paragraph 2 clearly describe the timeframe of its applicability. The words \"[a]s long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention\" leave no doubt that the Parties had in mind the period prior to Venezuela becoming a Party to the ICSID Convention. The fact that only Venezuela, and not Barbados, is expressly mentioned in this paragraph, clearly reveals that this provision contemplated the pre-ICSID period. There is nothing in the formula used by the Parties which would suggest that this provision was meant to also deal with the scenario in which one of the Parties were to denounce the Convention and cease to be bound by it (as Venezuela did in 2012). Had this been their intention, they could have easily used the formula \"as long as one of the Parties is not a Contracting State of the Convention\". It may be, and it is rather very likely, that they had not even considered such a scenario, although under Article 71 of the ICSID Convention any Contracting State has the right to denounce the Convention by written notice. But it is not the task of the Tribunal to speculate, nor to read into the text what it does not say.\n\n84.\n\nThe key issue in the context of paragraph 2 is the link between the first sentence and the second one. The first provides for arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules \"as long as the Republic of Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the Convention\". The second specifies that \"if for any reason the Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the [UNCITRAL] rules\". The second sentence, in the view of the Tribunal, has to be read in relation to the first one. It does not constitute a self-standing provision. The temporal limitation provided for in the first sentence of paragraph 2 thus also applies to the second sentence.\n\n85.\n\nThe Additional Facility was an option in the pre-ICSID period. And only if \"for any reason\" during this period it was not available did arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules provide a substitute arbitral forum.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that it cannot submit the dispute to arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules because the BIT only provides for arbitration under these rules during the time period prior to Venezuela becoming a Contracting State to the Convention, not after Venezuela denounced it.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant nevertheless maintains that UNCITRAL arbitration is available in view of the fact that the Additional Facility is no longer available. It emphasizes the words \" if for any reason the Additional Facility is not available\", arguing that in that case, it has the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. In support of its position, it invokes paragraph 4 of Article 8, emphasizing that each Contracting Party has given its unconditional consent to arbitration.\n\n88.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, paragraph 4 does not strengthen the Claimant\u2019s position. The unconditional consent given by the Contracting Parties to the BIT is the consent to submit disputes referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 8 to international arbitration \" in accordance with the provisions of this Article \". Although consent to international arbitration is expressed in Article 8(4) and is still valid, in order to generate legal consequences in relation to different arbitral fora, the conditions specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 8 have to be met. Paragraph 1 envisages ICSID arbitration, which at present is not available as Venezuela ceased to be bound by the ICSID Convention on 25 July 2012. The continued validity of Venezuela\u2019s consent to arbitration under Article 8(4) as long as it is a Contracting Party to the BIT would provide for ICSID jurisdiction in the future if Venezuela one day decides to accede once again to the ICSID Convention. Paragraph 2, in the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation, envisages situations which might have arisen before Venezuela became a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.\n\n89.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal has to conclude that Article 8 alone does not provide a basis for its jurisdiction in the case at hand as arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules was contemplated by the BIT\u2019s Contracting Parties for the period during which Venezuela had not yet become a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention. The present arbitral proceedings were not instituted before Venezuela became a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention, but only after it had ceased to be one, following its denunciation of the Convention.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s analysis, however, cannot stop here as the Claimant also relies on Article 3 of the BIT, containing the MFN clause, as support for its contention that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the case. It is this issue to which the Tribunal now turns its attention.\n\n**B. THE APPLICATION OF THE MFN CLAUSE TO THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS IN** ARTICLE**8**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n91.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to adopt the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 8, the Claimant argues that the MFN clause contained in Article 3 of the Treaty allows the Claimant to take advantage of the dispute settlement provisions of other BITs to which Venezuela is a party, including those which provide for an unrestricted choice of UNCITRAL arbitration or those which the Respondent itself acknowledges provide for UNCITRAL arbitration as a catch-all default dispute resolution option.59The provisions of these BITs are, according to the Claimant, more favorable because they provide investors with a choice of dispute resolution fora.60\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 63, citing Memorial, \u00b6 30; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b654-55; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b638-39 Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 77:9-78:19, citing Canada-Venezuela BIT, Article XII(4) (RLA-33); Czech Republic -Venezuela BIT, Article 8 (RLA-34); Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, Article IX(3) (RLA-35); Lithuania-Venezuela BIT, Article 7 (RLA-36); Portugal-Venezuela BIT, Article 8(2) (RLA-37); Uruguay-Venezuela BIT, Article 9 (RLA-38); Iran-Venezuela BIT, Article 11(2) (RLA-26); Venezuela-Belarus BIT, Article 8(2) (C-37); Venezuela-Cuba BIT, Article 9(3) and Protocol, Article 3 (C-38); Venezuela-Vietnam BIT, Article 8(2) (C-39); Russia-Venezuela BIT (RLA-27), Article 9(2).

Argentina\"].*\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant notes that Article 3(3) of the Treaty expressly states that the MFN clause applies to the dispute resolution provisions under the Treaty. According to the Claimant, the present situation and Treaty are equivalent to those examined in *Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan,* where the tribunal found that it did not need to grapple with the debate over whether MFN clauses apply to dispute settlement provisions generally, because the language of Article 3(3) required it to apply MFN treatment to the dispute resolution provisions.61 The *Garanti Koza* tribunal further found that, even if it were not possible to import consent to arbitration into a BIT that did not provide for arbitration, \"the essential consent of the State - the consent to resolve disputes with U.K. investors by means of international arbitration - does not in this case need to be imported by operation of the MFN clause, because that consent is contained in Article 8(1) of the BIT\", just as it is, the Claimant contends, in Article 8(4) ofthe Barbados-Venezuela BIT.62\n\nCounter-Memorial, 56-63, citing *Garanti Koza v.

Russia* tribunal\u2019s rejection of similar arguments:  \n | D |isputc resolution mechanisms accepted by a State in various international instruments are all legitimate in the eyes of that State. Some may be inherently more efficient. Others may be more reliable in a particular context. Having options may be thought to be more \"favoured\" for MFN purposes than not having them. It is not convincing for a State to argue in general terms that it accepted a particular \"system of arbitration\" with respect to the nationals of one country but did not so consent with respect to the nationals of another. The extension of commitments is in the very nature of MFN clauses.67\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 80:21-82:3, 130:13-132:20\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 60; Rejoinder, \u00b6 42; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 81:7-83:22, 127:24-130:12.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, citing, *inter alia,*  *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini c.* The Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB / 97/7, Decision of the Tribunal on Objection to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 54-64 (CLA-21 / RLA-119) [hereinafter *\"Maffezini v.

Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the lack of consent to UNCITRAL arbitration in Article 8 of the Treaty cannot be remedied by resort to the MFN clause in Article 3 of the Treaty. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant relies on a single decision, *Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan,* which was recently rendered by a majority of an ICSID tribunal over the strong dissent of one of the arbitrators, and which is both incorrect and distinguishable from the present case.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Claimant that the question of the applicability of the MFN standard to dispute settlement is resolved by Article 3(3) of the Treaty, which clarifies that the MFN standards set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 3 extend to the dispute settlement provisions in Article 8. However, the Respondent asserts that \"even when the MFN standard applies to dispute settlement generally, the system of dispute settlement carefully negotiated by the Contracting Parties cannot be replaced by another, neither negotiated, nor agreed, through the mere invocation of the MFN clause.\"68\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 50-59; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 37:13-39:11, citing *Maffezini v. Spain, supra* note 65, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63 (\"[T]here are some important limits that ought to be kept in mind. [...I]f the agreement provides for a particular arbitration forum, such as ICSID, for example, this option cannot be changed by invoking the [MFN] clause, in order to refer the dispute to a different system of arbitration\"); *Plama v. Bulgaria, supra* note 16, \u00b6 209 (\"It is one thing to add to the treatment provided in one treaty more favorable treatment provided elsewhere. It is quite another thing to replace a procedure specifically negotiated by parties with an entirely different mechanism.\"); *Wintershall v.

The Respondent repeats its earlier arguments that the present Treaty contains no general consent to arbitration, only \"an acceptance of arbitration within the precise terms set out in article 8.\"70 In this context, the Respondent notes that the acceptability of UNCITRAL arbitration in other Venezuelan BITs or in general is irrelevant:71 the MFN clause cannot serve to import consent to arbitration where there is none in the basic treaty.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61; Hearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 39:12-41:1, 101:15-102:4.\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 39:12-41:1.

For example, the *Hochtief v. Argentina* tribunal held:  \n In the present case, it might be argued that the MFN clause requires that investors under the Argentina-Germany BIT be given MFN treatment during the conduct of an arbitration but that the MFN clause cannot create a right to go to arbitration where none otherwise exists under the BIT. The argument can be put more generally: the MFN clause stipulates how investors must be treated when they are exercising the rights given to them under the BIT but does not purport to give them any further rights in addition to those given to them under the BIT.  \n [...]  \n In the view of the Tribunal, it cannot be assumed that Argentina and Germany intended that the MFN clause should create wholly new rights where none otherwise existed under the Argentina-Germany BIT. [...] The MFN clause is not a *renvoi* to a range of totally distinct sources and systems of rights and duties: it is a principle applicable to the exercise of rights and duties that are actually secured by the BIT in which the MFN clause is found.72\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 62-67, citing *Hochtiefv.

Spain* tribunal held, no investment award or decision has since then decided that an MFN provision would allow the import of consent to ICSID arbitration from another treaty. [...] The role of the MFN clause is not to substitute for a lack of consent, but to ensure that the consent given is implemented in the most favourable manner to the individual investor entitled to protection, as compared to the treatment given to other such individuals in treaties with third countries. The *National Grid v. Argentina* tribunal correctly noted that an MFN clause is not a basis for creating consent to ICSID arbitration when none exists.  \n [...]  \n Granting Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT such extensive effect as to allow for consent to ICSID through incorporation by reference in the frame of a treaty that does not allow this, would have the effect of \"replacing] a procedure specifically negotiated by parties with an entirely different mechanism\" or \"system of arbitration\". It would involve a forum-shopping attitude that bypasses the consent requirement of the Respondent while running against the fundamental principles of international adjudication.73\n\nReply, \u00b6 68, citing *Garanti Koza LLP v.

Turkmenistan* case was wrong, but was in any event premised on the idea that Turkmenistan had provided a general or \"essential consent\" to arbitration in Article 8(1) of the UK-Turkmenistan BIT and a standing offer of UNCITRAL arbitration in Article 8(2), neither of which is present in the instant Treaty.74\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 41:9-42:21.93:3-95:13.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis of the BIT\u2019s provisions in Article 3 on MFN treatment75 and its implications with respect to Article 8 thereof, by referring to Article 3, paragraph 3. It leaves no doubt that the MFN provisions under this BIT are applicable to the provisions on settlement of disputes between one Contracting Party and nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party as well. Paragraph 3 reads as follows: \"The treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provision of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement\". Article 8 thus features among the Articles to the provisions of which the MFN treatment shall apply.\n\nThe text of Article 3 is reproduced above. See *supra* \"The Treaty\", Section III.A, \u00b645.\n\n101.\n\nThis is not disputed by the Respondent, who, while observing that \"investment tribunals are divided as to the applicability of MFN [clauses] to dispute settlement provisions\", accepts that \"in this case, [... ] the applicability of the MFN standards to dispute settlement is resolved by the BIT itself.\"76\n\nReply, \u00b653.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal thus need not pronounce itself on the applicability of MFN clauses to arbitration clauses or dispute settlement provisions in general, in particular in situations when the MFN clause is silent on the scope of its applicability. Arbitral tribunals remain deeply divided on this issue.77 Nor does the Tribunal have to engage in an analysis as to whether the term \"treatment\" in the text of Article 8 of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT covers only substantive standards of treatment, or includes also procedural rights, including the right to initiate arbitral proceedings.78 Article 3 in its paragraph (3) is clear that \"[t]he treatment provided for\" in the two paragraphs thereof shall apply also to the provisions of Article 8. As the Study Group of the International Law Commission on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, having studied the issue between 2009 and 2015, observed in its Final Report \"[t]he point [whether MFN provisions are capable of applying to the dispute settlement provisions of the BITs] is essentially one of party autonomy; the parties to a BIT can, if they wish, include the conditions for access to dispute settlement within the scope of coverage of an MFN provision. The question in each case is whether they have done so.\"79 Venezuela and Barbados have done so in their BIT; they have agreed *expressis verbis* that the MFN treatment clause shall apply to Article 8, i.e., to dispute settlement provisions and conditions for resorting to international arbitration thereunder. Therefore, this Tribunal has no other choice than to apply and enforce these provisions \"in accordance with their terms pursuant to the principle of *pacta sunt servanda\"*,80 The majority believes that it must give\u00a0*bona fide* effect to the provisions agreed by the Parties in their BIT, and not to empty Article 3(3) of its meaning, thereby rendering it inapplicable to Article 8 as is the view preferred in the attached dissenting opinion.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these divergencies between different Tribunals stem mostly from the fact that the BITs these Tribunals had to interpret remained silent on the applicability of the MFN clauses to investor-State dispute settlement procedures. That is the case e.g. of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, the Argentina-Germany BIT or the Bulgaria-Germany BIT. For that reason this Tribunal does not consider awards or decisions pursuant to such BITs (e.g., *ICS v. Argentina, supra* note 17; *Wintershall v.* Argentina, *supra* note 17; *Daimler v.* Argentina, *supra* note 42; *Hochtief v. Argentina, supra* note 60; *ST-AD v. Bulgaria)* as relevant for its interpretation and application of Articles 3 and 8 of the Venezuela-Barbados BIT, since this Tribunal has a duty to apply the provisions of Article 3 to Article 8.\n\nThis is yet another divisive issue. The Tribunal, however, notes that some tribunals which interpreted MFN clauses in the BITs not expressly providing for the applicability of the MFN clause to the investor-State dispute settlement procedures have concluded that \"[a]n investor\u2019s entitlement to resort to arbitration under a BIT must be construed as an integral part of the treatment accorded to [the investor].\" *Le Ch\u00e8que D\u00e9jeuner and C.D Holding Internationale v.

This kind of provision has been used frequently in the BITs concluded by the United Kingdom since 1990/1991.81 It may be that this example \"inspired\" Barbados and Venezuela during the negotiations of their BIT under consideration in the present case. Be that as it may, what is important is the fact that, as the commentators of the UK Model BIT explain, \"[w]here Article 3(3) is included, it therefore provides an answer to the controversial question whether the MFN provision also applies to procedural issues such as investor-State dispute settlement.\"82\n\nSee *National Grid* v. *Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction, 20 June 2006, \u00b685. Article 3(3) also appeared in the UK Model BIT (1991), see 3 International Investment Agreements 185.\n\nChester Brown & Audley Sheppard, \"United Kingdom\" in: C. Brown (ed.), Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties (2013), p. 728.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 3(1) deals with treatment of \"investments\", while Article 3(2) deals with treatment of \"nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\" (i.e., investors). The right to submit a dispute to arbitration is a right accorded by Article 8 of the BIT, under the conditions specified therein, to an \"investor\". Article 8(2) uses the expression \"the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration.\" It follows that MFN treatment can extend to dispute settlement provisions only through the operation of Article 3(2) of the Treaty. \"Investment\" as such has no procedural rights, therefore Article 3(1) is without relevance for the purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into its jurisdiction.\n\n105.\n\nIt is now for the Tribunal to determine how Article 3(2) impacts the provisions of Article 8 on settlement of disputes between an investor and a State. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the MFN clause cannot serve the purpose of importing consent to arbitration when none exists under the BIT between Barbados and Venezuela.83 It also appears that the Claimant is arguing that it does not seek to import consent to arbitration in the present case from another BIT concluded by Venezuela with a third State.84\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 38:9-11.\n\nHearing Transcript (10 July 2014), 81:8-12.\n\n106.\n\nThe question which has to be answered is whether Venezuela has given its consent to international arbitration for disputes with Barbadian investors in the BIT at hand.\n\n107.\n\nIt is necessary to recall Article 8(4) of the BIT. It provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this article\". Venezuela thus has given its *unconditional consent* to international arbitration, but of course, with the caveat \"in accordance with the provisions of Article 8.\" The Tribunal earlier analyzed Article 885 and reached its conclusion that \"arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules was agreed to by the BIT\u2019s Contracting Parties for the period during which Venezuela had not yet become a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention\".86 Without Article 3 of the BIT, this would have been the end of the exercise.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 68-89 above.\n\n\u00b6 89 above.\n\n108.\n\nArticle 3(3), however, requires the Tribunal to apply \"the treatment provided for in paragraph [...] (2) [...] to the provisions of\u2019 Article 8 of the BIT. The principle of effectiveness calls for giving effect to Article 3(2).\n\n109.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Venezuela has given its consent, as it is stipulated in Article 8(4) -\"its unconditional consent\" - to the submission of investment disputes with Barbadian investors to international arbitration. Article 8(4), by using the expression \"in accordance with the provisions of this Article\", makes such submission of disputes to international arbitration subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 8. These conditions determine the arbitration forum to which a dispute can be submitted, either ICSID, the ICSID Additional Facility, or arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. Yet, the fact remains that Article 8(4) expresses the Contracting Parties\u2019 overall \"unconditional consent\" to international arbitration. Venezuela has given in Article 8 one consent to international arbitration, not three different consents (one to ICSID arbitration, one to ICSID Additional Facility arbitration and one to *ad hoc* arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules). That consent covers three different arbitral fora (ICSID, Additional Facility, UNCITRAL) under the conditions specified in Article 8.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that otherwise Article 8(4) would serve no other useful purpose as it would have been sufficient for the Contracting Parties to limit Article 8 just to its first three paragraphs. Paragraph 1 would have provided for arbitration under the ICSID Convention, while paragraph 2 would have covered scenarios prior to Venezuela\u2019s becoming Party to the ICSID Convention. There is a presumption that the Parties, by including a specific paragraph in Article 8, namely paragraph 4, by which they give their \"unconditional consent to the submission of disputes [\u2018between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this [BIT] in relation to an investment of the latter\u2019]87 to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article\", intended to give a meaning to this paragraph, or in other words, this paragraph has to produce the legal effects intended by the Parties.\n\nThese are the words taken from Article 8(1) substituted for the phrase \"as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article\" used in Article 8(4).\n\n111.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, Article 8(4) expresses - as long as the BIT is in force, and it is not disputed that it is still in force - each Contracting Party\u2019s consent to submission of investment disputes with nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to international arbitration. There is thus no question of importing Venezuela\u2019s consent to international arbitration with Barbadian investors through the operation of Article 3(2) of the BIT from another of Venezuela\u2019s BITs concluded with a third State. The question rather is that of the conditions for resorting to international arbitration. Venezuela, by withdrawing from the ICSID Convention, has not withdrawn its consent to international arbitration, expressed in Article 8(4) of the BIT. The consent is still there and valid. Venezuela\u2019s withdrawal from the ICSID Convention prevents Barbadian investors from instituting arbitral proceedings under Article 8(1) of the BIT as doing so is conditioned, pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, upon Venezuela being a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. The door to ICSID arbitration has thus been shut by Venezuela. However, if one day Venezuela accepts the Convention anew as it may, the door to ICSID arbitration will reopen since so long as the consent to international arbitration under the BIT has not been withdrawn, it continues to be in place. Without this consent this would not be possible because, as the last preambular paragraph of the ICSID Convention confirms \"no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to... arbitration.\"\n\n112.\n\nArticle 8 contains only conditions determining which one of the three arbitral fora mentioned therein may be available. It sets forth no other conditions such as those which are provided for in a number of other BITs, e.g., the requirement that an investor litigate a dispute before the domestic courts of the host State for a specific duration prior to initiating arbitral proceedings or the requirement that an investor make a *bona fide* attempt to settle the dispute through negotiations for a specified period of time (the so-called \"cooling-off\u2019 period) before instituting arbitral proceedings. Therefore, in the view of the Tribunal, since Venezuela and Barbados agreed in Article 3 of their BIT that the MFN treatment clause shall apply to dispute settlement procedures under Article 8, and since the Respondent admits as much, the MFN treatment is relevant to the application of the conditions under which an arbitral forum may be seised.\n\n113.\n\nRecourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules is subject to a temporal condition, namely that it has been envisaged for the period prior to Venezuela becoming a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention if the Additional Facility was not available for any reason.\n\n114.\n\nIt is in the nature of an MFN clause that the \"treatment accorded by the granting State to the beneficiary State, or to persons [... ] in a determined relationship with that State\" is \"not less favourable than treatment extended by the granting State to a third State or to persons [... ] in the same relationship with that third State\".88\n\nArticle 5, *ILC Final Draft Articles with Commentaries on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses* (1978), Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1978, Vol. II, Part Two, p. 21, also reproduced in A. Watts, 3 The International Law Commission 1949-1998.1808 (1999).\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that a number of the BITs concluded by Venezuela with third States provide more favourable terms to investors, including Venezuela\u2019s BITs with Belarus, Cuba, Iran, the Russian Federation, Vietnam, Canada, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Lithuania, Portugal and Uruguay.89 It is not necessary for the Tribunal to analyze all these BITs. It is sufficient that one of them provides for more favourable treatment of investors in relation to the conditions under which they can have recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules than Barbadian investors. If, in one of these BITs, the temporal condition for recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules is less stringent, or - in other words - more favourable to investors than the one in the Barbados-Venezuela BIT, then Barbadian investors relying on Article 3(2) of the BIT can claim not to be subjected to the conditions in Article 8(2) of the BIT as they appear therein, but to the conditions more favorable to the investor from the third State.\n\nRejoinder, 31, \u00b6 41\n\n116.\n\nOne of the treaties invoked is the BIT which Venezuela concluded with Ecuador on 18 November 1993.90 Article IX, devoted to settlement of disputes between an investor and the Contracting Party in which the investment was made, provides for international arbitration and in that context for three possible arbitral fora, namely ICSID, an ICSID Additional Facility and an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules, like Article 8 of the Venezuela-Barbados BIT. It is useful to reproduce here the full text of Article IX of the Venezuela-Ecuador BIT. It reads:\n\n**Article IX**\n\n**Settlement of disputes between an investor and the Contracting Party in which the investment was made**\n\n1. Any dispute between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning implementation by the latter of the provisions of this Agreement shall, to the extent possible, be settled by means of amicable consultations.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the time it was initiated by one of the Parties, it may be submitted, at the request of the investor, to:\n\n- The competent courts of the Contracting Party, in whose territory the investment was made; or\n\n- International arbitration, on the terms laid down in paragraph 3.\n\nOnce an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party in question or to international arbitration, the choice of one or other of those procedures shall be final.\n\n3. If the investor decides to have recourse to arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which was opened for signature in Washington, D.C., on 18 March 1965, once both States Parties to this Agreement have acceded to the Convention. Until such condition has been met, each Contracting Party agrees that the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rales of the Additional Facility of ICSID for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings. If for any reason ICSID or its Additional Facility is not available, the dispute shall be submitted, at the request of the investor, to an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n4. The arbitral award shall be limited to detennining whether there is a breach of this Agreement by the Contracting Party, whether such breach lias caused harm to the investor and, if such is the case, the amount of compensation which is appropriate.\n\n5. Arbitral awards shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Contracting Party shall execute them in accordance with its legislation.91\n\n*Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Venezuela and the Government of Ecuador for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments,* UNTS, vol. 1989, pp. 407-421 (RLA-35). It was registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations, in accordance with Article 102 of the UN Charter, by Venezuela on 10 September 1997. The text in Spanish, which is the authentic text, together with translations into English and French, was published under No. 34030 in the UN Treaty Series.\n\nThe original Spanish text of Article IX reads:  \n ARTICULO IX  \n SOLUCION DE CONTROVERSIAS ENTRE UN INVERSOR Y LA PARTE CONTRATANTE RECEPTORA DE LA INVERSION  \n 1- Toda controversia entre un inversor de una Parte Contratante y la otra Parte Contratante respecto del cumplimiento por \u00e9sta de las disposiciones de este Convenio ser\u00e1, en la medida de lo posible, solucionada por consultas amistosas.  \n 2. - Si la controversia no hubiera podido ser solucionada en el t\u00e9nnino de seis meses a partir del momento en que hubiera sido planteada por una u otra de las Partes, podr\u00e1 ser sometida, a pedido del inversor:  \n O bien a los tribunales competentes de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio se realiz\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n,  \n - O bien al arbitraje internacional en las condiciones descritas en el p\u00e1rrafo (3).  \n Una vez que un inversor haya sometido la controversia a las jurisdicciones de la Parte Contratante implicada o al arbitraje internacional, la elecci\u00f3n de uno u otro de esos procedimientos ser\u00e1 definitiva.  \n 3. - Si el inversor resuelve someter la controversia a arbitraje, \u00e9ste se efectuar\u00e1 en el Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (C.I.A.D.I.), creado por el \"Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a las Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de otros Estados\", abierto a la finna en Washington el 18 de marzo de 1965, cuando cada Estado Parte en el presente Convenio haya adherido a aquel. Mientras esta condici\u00f3n no se cumpla, cada Parte Contratante da su consentimiento para que la controversia sea sometida al arbitraje conforme con el reglamento del Mecanismo Complementario del C.I.A.D.I. para la administraci\u00f3n de procedimientos de conciliaci\u00f3n, de arbitraje o de investigaci\u00f3n.  \n - Si por cualquier motivo no estuviere disponible el CIADI ni su mecanismo complementario, la controversia ser\u00e1 sometida, a petici\u00f3n del inversor, a un tribunal de arbitraje \"ad hoc\" establecido de acuerdo con las reglas de arbitraje de la Comisi\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas para el Derecho Mercantil Internacional (C.N.U.D.M. L).  \n 4. - La sentencia arbitral se limitar\u00e1 a determinar si la Parte Contratante ha incumplido este Convenio, si ese incumplimiento ha causado un da\u00f1o al inversor y, si este fuere el caso, a fijar el monto de la indemnizaci\u00f3n correspondiente.  \n 5. - Las sentencias arbitrales ser\u00e1n definitivas y obligatorias para las partes en la controversia. Cada Parte Contratante las ejecutar\u00e1 de confonnidad con su legislaci\u00f3n.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that paragraph 2 gives the investor a choice, which once made becomes final, to submit a dispute which could not be settled amicably within six months, either to the competent courts of the host State or to international arbitration. In relation to international arbitration the provision specifies that such submission of a dispute shall be \"on the terms laid down in paragraph 3\".\n\n118.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, paragraph 2 of Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT expresses the consent of these two States to international (investment) arbitration similarly to how such consent is given in Article 8(4) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT, albeit in the latter it is expressed in an even more emphatic way (\"Each Contracting Party hereby gives its *unconditional* consent\"). Further the Tribunal does not see any material or substantive difference in the formulas used in Article 8(4) (\"consent [...] to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article\") and in Article IX(2) (\"[\u00bfInternational arbitration, on the terms laid down in paragraph 3\"). Both refer to the conditions specified in the provisions referred to therein.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal has analyzed above92 the conditions set forth in Article 8 of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT, more precisely in paragraphs 1 and 2 thereof. Moving now to the terms, or in other words the conditions, laid down in paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, the Tribunal wishes to make several observations.\n\nSee *supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 74-89.\n\n120.\n\n*First,* it provides for recourse to ICSID arbitration \"once both States Parties to the [BIT] have acceded to the [ICSID] Convention\". It is worth recalling that the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT was signed on 18 November 1993 when only Ecuador was a party to the ICSID Convention,93 while Venezuela was only a signatory State but not yet a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention.94 The exact same situation of Venezuela not being a Party to the ICSID Convention continued when it signed the BIT with Barbados a few months later, on 15 July 1994.95\n\nEcuador signed the Convention on 15 January 1986 and deposited its instalment of ratification on the same date. The Convention entered into force for Ecuador on 14 February 1987.\n\nVenezuela signed the Convention on 18 August 1993 and deposited its instalment of ratification on 2 May 1995. The Convention entered into force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995.\n\nSee *supra,* \u00b6 3 and note 1, as well as \u00b6 76.\n\n121.\n\n*Second,* under these same circumstances, both BITs now under the Tribunal\u2019s focus, provide for the ICSID Additional Facility. The Tribunal has already interpreted the words \"[a]s long as [...] Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention\", in Article 8(2) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT as \"leaving] no doubt that the Parties had in mind the period prior to Venezuela becoming a Party to the ICSID Convention\".96 The Tribunal also noted the agreement of the Parties to the dispute on this point in relation to the availability of the ICSID Additional Facility only in Venezuela\u2019s pre-ICSID period.97 The Ecuador-Venezuela BIT provides in Article IX(3) that \"[u]ntil such condition has been met [i.e., until both Contracting Parties to the BIT \u2018have acceded to the [ICSID] Convention\u2019], each Contracting Party agrees that the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the Additional Facility of ICSID\". In the view of the Tribunal, the expression \"until such condition has been met\" means, in the circumstances prevailing at the moment of signing the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, until Venezuela has become a Party to the ICSID Convention, or in other words it covers the pre-ICSID period. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not see any material difference in the temporal scope of the expressions \"[a]s long as... Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention\" and \"[u]ntil such condition has been met [i.e., until \u2018both States Parties to the [BIT] have acceded to the [ICSID] Convention\u2019]\".\n\nSee *supra,* \u00b6 83.\n\nSee *supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 81. 86.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal pauses here to observe that investors from Ecuador and from Barbados in Venezuela, in relation to international arbitration with Venezuela before an ICSID Tribunal or under the Additional Facility Rules, were in the same situation. ICSID became available only once Venezuela ratified the ICSID Convention. Until that moment, in the pre-ICSID period for Venezuela, they could have instituted arbitral proceedings under the Additional Facility Rules, but not once that pre-ICSID period was terminated.\n\n123.\n\n*Third,* both BITs also contemplate the possibility of seizing an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules. But there the similarity ends. The Barbados-Venezuela BIT provides that \"[i]f for any reason Additional Facility is not available the investor shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under the [UNCITRAL Rules]\". This option is envisaged in Article 8(2) which the Tribunal interpreted to the effect that its introductory words \"[a]s long as[...] Venezuela has not become a Contracting State of the [ICSID] Convention\" apply also in relation to the availability of arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules.98\n\nSee *supra* \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n\n124.\n\nThe structure of Article IX(3) of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT differs from paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT. Article IX(3) is divided into two distinct subparagraphs. The original Spanish text makes this abundantly clear by not only separating the two subparagraphs, but also by opening the second one with a hyphen. The second subparagraph gives a right to the investor to submit a dispute to an\u00a0*ad hoc* tribunal under the UNCITRAL Rules not only when the Additional Facility is for any reason not available, but also when ICSID itself is for any reason not available. This is a critical difference in comparison with the Barbados-Venezuela BIT.\n\n125.\n\nEcuador and Venezuela knew when they concluded their BIT that ICSID would be available \"once both States Parties to this [BIT] have acceded to the [ICSID] Convention\", i.e., once Venezuela ratified it, as Ecuador had already been a Party to the ICSID Convention. For the period prior to Venezuela\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention, as the words \"[u]ntil such condition has been met\" used in the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article IX clearly indicate, the Additional Facility was the substitute forum. The words in the separate second subparagraph \"[i]f for any reason ICSID [... ] is not available\" cannot be limited just to one single reason, namely to Venezuela becoming a Party to the ICSID Convention through its ratification, since that reason was already specifically addressed in subparagraph 1 of Article IX and the \"remedy\" provided for therein in the form of the Additional Facility. \"Any reason\" in relation to the ICSID has to have a broader meaning, covering also a situation when the ICSID, having become open to an Ecuadorian investor following Venezuela\u2019s ratification of the ICSID Convention, would later be unavailable for \"any reason\", for instance as a result of denunciation of that Convention pursuant to its Article 71.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal reads the condition \"[i]f for any reason ICSID or its Additional Facility is not available\"99 for recourse to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules as a cumulative one, meaning that neither ICSID nor its Additional Facility is available. The Additional Facility is not available since, in the view of the Tribunal, it was contemplated for the period before Venezuela ratified the ICSID Convention and thus joined Ecuador, among other States, as a Contracting Party thereto. That is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the meaning of the phrase \"[u]ntil such condition has been met\" in Article IX(3). In any event, irrespective of the temporal scope of that phrase, the Additional Facility is not available to investors from Ecuador under the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT since both countries denounced the ICSID Convention and are no longer Contracting Parties to it. Ecuador did so on July 6, 2009 with effect, under Article 71 ofthe ICSID Convention, as of 7 January 2010. Venezuela\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention on 24 January 2012 took effect on 25 July 2012. Nor is ICSID available for Ecuadorian investors in investment disputes with Venezuela. However, Ecuadorian investors may still have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration since neither ICSID nor the Additional Facility is available. Therefore, they benefit from more favorable treatment than investors from Barbados.\n\nIn the original Spanish text \"- Si por cualquier motivo no estuviera disponible el CI ADI ni su mecanismo complementario\"\n\n127.\n\nVenezuela in its BIT with Ecuador in Article IX(2) agreed to international arbitration with Ecuadorian investors, on the terms laid down in paragraph 3. Venezuela, in relation to investors from Barbados, has given in Article 8(4) its unconditional consent to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of that Article. Both Articles provide for three arbitral fora (ICSID, Additional Facility, UNCITRAL arbitration) under the conditions specified therein. The conditions under which Ecuadorian investors have a right to recourse to an UNCITRAL arbitration are more favorable than the conditions for investors from Barbados.\n\n128.\n\nHowever, in Article 3(2) of its BIT with Barbados Venezuela accepted an obligation not to subject nationals or companies from Barbados to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to nationals or companies of any third State. Ecuador is such a third State. Under Article 3(3) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT such treatment shall also apply, beyond any doubt, to the settlement of disputes with investors who are nationals of Barbados. Venezuela, having given its consent to international arbitration, shall accept that Barbados\u2019 investors shall have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration, which is listed in Article 8(2) of the BIT, under conditions which are not less favorable than the conditions under which Ecuadorian investors have such recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration pursuant to Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT.\n\n129.\n\nIt follows that investors from Barbados, relying on Article 3(2) of the Barbados-Venezuela BIT, are entitled to submit their investment disputes with Venezuela in accordance with its Article 8 on the same conditions as investors from Ecuador.\n\n130.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, having regard to Article 3(2) of the BIT and Article IX of the Ecuador-Venezuela BIT, the objection of the Respondent that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction\u00a0*ratione voluntatis* has to be rejected.\n\n**VI.

It is true that the attribution of the alleged acts to the State is one of the constitutive elements of an internationally wrongful act, together with the finding of a breach of an international obligation and the absence of the circumstances that preclude wrongfulness. However, to undertake such an analysis, which concerns the merits of the case, it is first necessary to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It is not necessary that I examine in this declaration other issues of jurisdiction *ratione personae* that may have arisen in the present case and that were not addressed by the Parties. In other circumstances, the Tribunal should have decided *proprio motu* on issues related to its jurisdiction *ratione personae,* even if they were not raised by the Parties.\n\n3.\n\nOf all the violations of the obligations under the Barbados/Venezuela BIT alleged by the Claimant, the only one upheld was that relating to the arbitrary and discriminatory conduct against the Claimant for the non-payment of the dividends that corresponded to it in 2008 and 2009. The Partial Award examines why such dividends were paid to one of the shareholders of Petroritupano, who was also a foreign investor (Petrobras Argentina). In my view, the key issue is not that the dividends were paid to another foreign investor, but that the only shareholder of Petroritupano to which those dividends have not been paid was the Claimant. This is sufficient to consider the act to be discriminatory. I understand that the Partial Award deemed it necessary to undertake such an analysis to reach the conclusion that such discriminatory act can be attributed to the Respondent. I reach the same conclusion, including in regards to the attribution of such decision to the Respondent, without any need to address the reasons for the payment to Petrobras Argentina.\n\n4.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I agree with my colleagues on the decision reached in this Partial Award."}], "Content": "Partial Award (Jurisdiction and Liability)\n------------------------------------------\n\n**GLOSSARY OF DEFINED TERMS / LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Anadarko** | Anadarko Venezuela LLC |\n| **BIT** | Bilateral Investment Treaty, namely the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments |\n| **Claimant** | Venezuela US, SRL |\n| **Conversion Contract** | Contract for Conversion to a Mixed Company between Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo, S.A., Petrobras Energ\u00eda Venezuela, S.A., Petrobras Energ\u00eda, S.A., APC Venezuela, S.R.L., Venezuela US SRL and Corod Producci\u00f3n, S.A., dated 3 August 2006 (Exhibit C-2) |\n| **Counter-Memorial** | Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 2 February 2017 |\n| **CVP** | Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leo |\n| **Hearing** | Hearing on jurisdiction and liability held on 28 and 29 November 2017 in The Hague |\n| **Hydrocarbons Law** | Hydrocarbons Organic Law, Decree No. 1510 (2 November 2001), Gaceta Oficial No. 37,323, dated 13 November 2001 (Exhibit C-5) |\n| **ILC Articles** | International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries (2001) II (Part Two) Yearbook of the ILC 31 |\n| **Instruction** | Instruction issued by the Minister of Energy and Petroleum, dated 12 April 2005 |\n| **Memorial** | Memorial on the Merits, dated 30 September 2014 |\n| **Operating Services****Agreement** | Reactivation of Oil Fields Operating Services Agreement between Corpoven S.A. and the Consortium Compa\u00f1\u00eda Naviera Perez Companc, Norcen International Ltd., Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd., Servicios Corod de Venezuela S.A., dated 1 November 1993 (Exhibit C-4) |\n| **Parties** | Claimant and Respondent |\n| **PCA** | Permanent Court of Arbitration |\n| **PDVSA** | Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. |\n| **PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo** | PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo S.A. |\n| **Petrobras Argentina** | Petrobras Energ\u00eda S.A. |\n| **PetroFalcon** | PetroFalcon Corporation |\n| **Petroritupano** | Petroritupano S.A. |\n| **PO1** | Procedural Order No. 1, dated 24 January 2014 |\n| **PO2** | Procedural Order No. 2, dated 7 July 2014 |\n| **PO3** | Procedural Order No.3, dated 11 April 2017 |\n| **PO4** | Procedural Order No. 4, dated 24 October 2017 |\n| **Rejoinder** | Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 13 October 2017 |\n| **Reply** | Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 16 June 2017 |\n| **Respondent** | Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| **Statement of Claim** | Statement of Claim, dated 17 January 2014 |\n| **Statement of Defense** | Statement of Defense, dated 3 March 2014 |\n| **Treaty** | Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments |\n| **UNCITRAL Rules** | Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 |\n| **VCLT** | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, dated 23 May 1969 |\n| **Venezuela** | Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela |\n| **Venezuelan Constitution** | Constituci\u00f3n de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela, Gaceta Oficial Extraordinaria No. 5,453 (24 March 2000); amended in 2009, Gaceta Oficial No. 5,908, dated 19 February 2009 (Exhibit C-40) |\n\n**I.

The Parties were also invited to submit any comments they might have prior to the publication of the Interim Award and Dissent on the PCA's website.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated 26 August 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal about the Parties' disagreement on the further timetable for the proceedings, given Respondent's desire to further bifurcate liability and quantum issues. The Claimant proposed therefore a schedule to proceed.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Respondent requested the Tribunal for bifurcated proceedings, as well as a minimum period for the submission of its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder in the event that proceedings were not bifurcated.\n\n50.\n\nOn 8 September 2016, the PCA communicated the Tribunal's decision to bifurcate the proceedings so that issues of quantum would be reserved for a subsequent stage depending on the decision in this next phase on remaining issues of jurisdiction and liability.

By e-mails of 12 and 14 November 2017, the Respondent opposed the Claimant's request and requested the Tribunal's authorization to make reference in its opening statement to certain additional legal authorities that were not already part of the record. By e-mail of 23 November 2017, the Claimant maintained its request for the admission of the two additional exhibits.

RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. THE TREATY**\n-----------------\n\n123.\n\nThe following are the relevant provisions of the Treaty:\n\n*Article 1*  \n*Definitions*\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n(a) \"investment\" means every kind of asset invested by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n\n(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company;\n\n(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;\n\n(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how;\n\n(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.\n\nA change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments and the term \"investment\" includes all investments, whether made before or after the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n\nThis agreement, however, does not apply to disputes arising from acts or occurrences which have taken place before its entry into force.\n\n(b) \"returns\" means the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though not exclusively, includes profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees;\n\n(c) \"nationals\" means, in respect of each contracting party, physical persons deriving their status as nationals from the law in force in that Contracting Party;\n\n(d) \"companies\" means, in respect of each Contracting Party, corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party;\n\nFor the purposes of the Convention referred to in Article 8 \"Company\" shall include any company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(e) \"territory\" means in respect of each contracting party, the territory thereof, the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone designated under the national law of that contracting party in accordance with the international law as an area within which that contracting party has sovereign rights and jurisdiction to explore, exploit and preserve the natural resources.\n\n*Article 2*  \n*Promotion and Protection of Investment*\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory, and, subject to its rights to exercise powers conferred by its laws, shall admit such capital.\n\n2. Investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the rules and principles of International law and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\n\n*Article 3*  \n*National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Provisions*\n\n1. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own nationals or companies or to investments or returns of nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n2. Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.\n\n3. The treatment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.\n\n*Article 5*  \n*Expropriation*\n\n1. Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national or company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.\n\n2. Where a Contacting Party expropriates the assets of accompany which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party owns shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.\n\n**B. VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nIt is also instructive to reproduce here the rules on the interpretation of treaties set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\"). While Barbados is a Party to the VCLT, having ratified it on 24 June 1971, Venezuela is not. However, it is now well accepted that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT reflect customary international law,73 and both Parties acknowledge that they govern the interpretation of the Treaty:\n\n*Article 31*  \n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nSee e.g. *LaGrand (Germany* v. *United States of America*), Judgment, 27 June 2001, 2001 ICJ REPORTS 466, p. 501, \u00b6 99; *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina* v. *Serbia and Montenegro),* 2007 ICJ REPORTS 43, pp. 109-110, \u00b6 160.\n\n**C. ILC ARTICLES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIn their arguments on attribution, the Parties have also extensively cited Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the Articles on Responsibility of States adopted by the International Law Commission (the \"**ILC Articles**\"), reproduced here below:\n\nIn their arguments on attribution, the Parties have also extensively cited Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the Articles on Responsibility of States adopted by the International Law Commission (the \"**ILC Articles**\"), reproduced here below:\n\n*Conduct of organs of a State*\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n\n*Article 5*  \n*Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority*\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n*Article 8*  \n*Conduct directed or controlled by a State*\n\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\n**V. Requests for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANT'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\na. A declaration that Venezuela has violated the BIT in connection with its treatment of VUS and VUS' investment;\n\nb. An award of damages in compensation for the full amount of damages suffered by VUS due to Venezuela's unlawful expropriation, to be determined by the Tribunal following the damages phase of the proceeding;\n\nc. Alternatively, in the event the Tribunal does not find an expropriation, then an award of damages in compensation for the full amount of damages suffered by VUS due to Venezuela's breaches of its other BIT obligations, to be determined by the Tribunal following the damages phase of the proceeding;\n\nd. An award of all costs and fees incurred in connection with the prosecution of this arbitration, to be determined by the Tribunal following the damages phase of the proceeding;\n\ne. An award of interest on any compensatory amounts until the date of full satisfaction of the award, at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal in accordance with the BIT; and\n\nf. Such other and further relief to which VUS may be justly entitled.74\n\nReply, \u00b6 152.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, all claims brought by Claimant in this Arbitration are outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and inadmissible. Therefore, all claims should be dismissed and this Tribunal should order Claimant to reimburse Respondent for all costs and expenses, including legal fees, relating to this Arbitration.75\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 125.\n\n**C. TRIBUNAL'S PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nIt appears from the Respondent's requested relief that in its view the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to consider \"all claims brought by Claimant\"76 and that the claims are inadmissible. The Respondent concludes that \"therefore, all claims should be dismissed\".77\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal discerns some contradiction in the Respondent's position. If the Tribunal is without jurisdiction, it cannot rule on the Claimant's claims and dismiss them. It can just declare itself without jurisdiction to consider the claims. It can eventually take a decision on the costs of the proceedings and close the case.\n\n**VI. REMAINING ISSUES ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe main argument advanced by the Respondent against the Tribunal's jurisdiction is that the actions of PDVSA and its affiliates complained of by the Claimant are not attributable to Venezuela. The Respondent submits that \"the obligations and alleged breaches asserted by Claimant exclusively relate to obligations either of CVP as a shareholder in Petroritupano or of Petroritupano itself in connection with the payment of dividends and the financial situation of Petroritupano.\"78\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 20.\n\n**A. ATTRIBUTION**\n------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the conduct of PDVSA and its affiliates is attributable to Venezuela under Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles, as well as under the structural and functional tests that inform the application of these provisions.79 The Claimant adds that, although \"a breach of a contract between an investor and a State-owned entity may certainly be attributed to the State if it amounts to a breach of an international obligation\", the Claimant's claims in this case \"allege breaches of Venezuela's obligations under the BIT, and the wrongful conduct [...] goes well beyond breach of contractual obligations.\"80 Additionally, according to the Claimant, \"[n]either the ILC Articles nor relevant international law precedent require an 'act by act' recitation of the acts attributable to the State or that the victim of this conduct identify which act falls under what rule of attribution.\"81\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 118.\n\nReply, \u00b6 55.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 84.\n\n132.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, PDVSA can be considered as a *de facto* organ of the Government of Venezuela under Article 4 of the ILC Articles and, as such, its actions are attributable to the State regardless of its classification, position, or functions.82 The Claimant asserts that PDVSA is used by the State to control and operate \"all aspects of hydrocarbons exploration, development, production, and sale in Venezuela.\"83\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 115, 127-136; Reply, \u00b6 60.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 127; Reply, \u00b6 61.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, pursuant to the Constitution, Organic Law of Public Administration,84 the Hydrocarbons Law, and PDVSA's articles of incorporation and bylaws, hydrocarbons exploration and production is reserved to the State in the first instance, but then delegated to PDVSA and its subsidiaries through the Venezuelan Energy Ministry, which has express power:\n\n(i) to define the company's policies; (ii) to exercise coordination, supervision, and control functions over the company on a permanent basis; (iii) to evaluate, on a continuous basis, the company's performance and management and report to the President of the Republic; (iv) to inform the national planning entity, on a quarterly basis, of the company's execution of its plans; and (v) to propose to the President of the Republic any necessary modifications to create, modify, or eliminate the State-owned company.85\n\nExhibit C-16, Organic Law of Public Administration, enacted on 31 July 2008.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 129, 138-143; Reply, \u00b6 61; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 48:10-51:3; Exhibit C-40, Venezuelan Constitution, Articles 302-303; Exhibit C-16, Organic Law of Public Administration, enacted on 31 July 2008; Exhibit C-5, Hydrocarbons Law, Articles 1, 5, 8, 9, 22; Exhibit C-9, PDVSA Articles of Incorporation, Presidential Decree No. 1,123, Gaceta Oficial No. 1,770 Extraordinario (30 August 1975); Exhibit C-76, PDVSA Bylaws, Decree No. 8327 (24 May 2011).\n\n134.\n\nSimilarly, the Executive appoints and dismisses PDVSA's President and the members of its Board of Directors.

In addition to the facts mentioned above, by statute PDVSA and CVP control and manage all aspects of the Mixed Companies. Also by statute, the Mixed Companies are required to sell their production to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, which serves its own role in the sovereign scheme. The acts by PDVSA and its subsidiaries of which Claimant complains [...] all fall within the scope of this sovereign authority over the petroleum sector and the Mixed Companies.93\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 116; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 70-74.\n\nReply, \u00b6 71.\n\n138.\n\nIn the further alternative, the Claimant asserts that PDVSA's and its affiliates acts are attributable to Venezuela under Article 8 of the ILC Articles because, even if they were to be considered as private entities, they were acting under the instructions, direction and control of the Government of Venezuela to achieve a particular result.94 According to the Claimant, even the \"Respondent does not assert that the PDVSA companies acted on their own initiative and without direction from the [Government of Venezuela] with respect to the wrongful acts and omissions resulting in harm to VUS and ultimately in the expropriation of VUS's investment.\"95 Thus, while the Claimant admits that \"[i]t is true that Claimant does not have in hand a piece of paper in which the [Government of Venezuela] directed PDVSA to pay the Petroritupano dividends to Petrobras, directing CVP to engage in its manipulations to pay itself, or directing PDVSA not to pay dividends to VUS,\" it should be inferred that such actions were directed or controlled by the State.96 In addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has not offered any contrary evidence, despite ample opportunities to do so.97\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 117; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 75-84.\n\nReply, \u00b6 78.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 81; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 55:1-60:18.

The Claimant contends as well that \"one way in which the [Government of Venezuela] plans to assure its continued control over PDVSA and the hydrocarbons sector is by injecting the Venezuelan military into PDVSA and its operations\" by creating the Compa\u00f1ia An\u00f3nima Militar de Industrias Mineras, Petrol\u00edferas y de Gas, to provide security to PDVSA. The Claimant asserts they're working together to \"achieve the [Government of Venezuela's] political aims\". Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108. The Claimant notes as well that Venezuela's national strategic plan insists on the importance of consolidating sovereignty over natural resources by, among others, maintaining and guaranteeing control over PDVSA, and ensuring State hegemony over national oil production. See Exhibit C-95, Ley del Plan de la Patria, Segundo Plan Socialista de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de la Naci\u00f3n 2013-2019, Gaceta Oficial No. 6,118 Extraordinario (4 December 2013). Additionally, the Claimant asserts that the strategic plan of PDVSA defines its existence in terms of the [Government of Venezuela's] Socialist political philosophy, and states that \"it acts according to guidelines and policies it receives from the Energy Ministry, on behalf of the National Executive, representing its sole shareholder.\" Reply, \u00b6112.\n\nReply, \u00b6 94; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 46:23-49:1, referring to Exhibit C-93, Decision No. 156, Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Constitutional Chamber (29 March 2017).\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the alleged obligations and breaches relate exclusively to \"obligations either of CVP as a shareholder in Petroritupano, or of Petroritupano itself in connection with the payment of dividends and the financial situation of Petroritupano.\"100 Therefore, these acts cannot be attributed to Venezuela and the Claimant's claims are inadmissible.101\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 20; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 78:18-80:3, 108:8-17; Hearing Transcript (29 November 2017), 263:8-24.\n\nHearing Transcript (29 November 2017), 257:1-7. Exhibit C-93. Decision No. 156, Supreme Tribunal of Justice, Constitutional Chamber (29 March 2017).\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, according to the Claimant, PDVSA, its affiliates and Petroritupano are simultaneously State organs, non-governmental entities exercising governmental authority and private corporations acting under the instruction or control of the State, which are mutually exclusive positions. The Respondent adds that, in any case, Articles 4, 5 and 8 \"cannot form the basis for attributing contractual obligations to a State that were entered into by separate legal entities and are governed by domestic law; [...] even if the contracting entities are directly or indirectly controlled by the State.\"102\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 21; Hearing Transcript (29 November 2017), 259:7-260:22.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that Venezuela was not a party to the Conversion Contract and argues that \"[i]nternational law differentiates between a State's responsibility for breaches of contractual undertakings given to foreign nationals by the State itself and a State's responsibility for breaches of a contract to which it is not a party.\"103 Therefore, the State cannot be held liable for a breach of a contract it has not entered into unless \"the act is (i) attributable to the State and (ii) inconsistent with the State's international law obligations.\"104 According to the Respondent, \"since there is no allegation that a breach of the Conversion Contract could amount to a breach of an international obligation of the state, one of the two requisite elements for a wrongful act to exist, the rules on attribution in the ILC Articles are not applicable to this case.\"105\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Rejoinder, \u00b6 41. The Respondent notes that the parties to the Conversion Contract are CVP, Petrobras Energ\u00eda Venezuela S.A., Petrobras Energ\u00eda S.A., APC Venezuela S.R.L, Venezuela US S.R.L and Corod Producci\u00f3n, S.A., and as established in article 9.1 \"Each party acknowledges that each one of the other Parties is entering into this Contract in its own name and in in its capacity as a legal entity empowered to contract on its own behalf.\" Exhibit C-2, Conversion Contract.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 23.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 30.\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that PDVSA, CVP, PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo and Petroritupano cannot be considered State organs under Article 4 of the ILC Articles because they are not recognized as such by any Venezuelan law.106 The Respondent explains that the companies were constituted as *sociedades an\u00f3nimas* having separate legal personalities that have been recognized and affirmed by Venezuelan legislation, the Venezuelan Supreme Court, and Venezuelan legal experts.107 In addition, the Respondent contends that the structural and functional criteria mentioned by the Claimant are not independent rules for attribution, but only \"epistemological tools used to determine whether certain conduct may be attributed to a State pursuant to ILC Articles 4 or 5.\"108\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b633, 62.\n\n*Ibid*, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 29-40; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 85:16-92:5.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 59.\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent argues that PDVSA and its affiliates cannot be considered *de facto* State organs either. According to the Respondent, \"[t]he ICJ made clear in the *Nicaragua* and the *Bosnian Genocide* cases that a finding of a *de facto* organ cannot be made absent 'complete dependence' of the alleged organ on the State.\"109 The Respondent distinguishes the decisions cited by the Claimant and refers instead to the case of *Almas v. Poland*, where the tribunal differentiated between an institution that performs public functions and one that engages on its own in commercial activities even if they are important for the national economy.110 In the Respondent's view, the fact that the oil industry is reserved to the Venezuelan State only means that \"private participation in that sector of the economy, although permitted, is limited and highly regulated.\"111\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 70; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 92:6-93:19, 109:3-117:17; Hearing Transcript (29 November 2017), 260:23-262:12; Exhibit RLA-190*, Military and Paramilitary Activities\u00a0in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Ukraine*, where the claim was rejected in the following terms: \"[t]he origin of the Claimant's claims is the non-payment of contractual debts by Energoatom. The payment or non-payment by a state entity of contractual debts owed to a service provider involves no exercise of sovereign authority or *puissance publique*, and cannot be attributed to the Ukraine.\"117 The Respondent concludes that \"[i]f Claimant's theory were correct, there would be no reason for any State-owned company to exist, as all contracts with state companies would then be deemed to be contracts with their governments and all acts of such companies would amount to State acts.\"118\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 64-66; Exhibit C-2, Conversion Contract, Article 9.1.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 44; Exhibit RLA-139, *Limited Liability Company AMTO v.

Iran*, where the tribunal considered the obligations allegedly breached to be obligations as between the parties, and not international obligations of the State.121 It emphasized that the State-owned entity had individual legal personality and that, even if the activities developed by the oil company were considered to be of strategic national importance, the State did not want to participate directly in the industry.122 Based on the *Amoco* decision, the Respondent insists that (i) obligations assumed by Petroritupano's shareholders cannot have any effect against a third party, (ii) regardless of Venezuela's control over PDVSA and its affiliates, they all have individual legal personalities, and (iii) it has not been proven that Venezuela instructed CVP to not pay the dividends.123\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 52; Exhibit CLA-36, *Amoco International Finance Corporation v.

Ghana*.124 According to the Respondent, this position was confirmed by the tribunal in the *Almas* case, which held that \"State instructions must have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred, not generally in respect of the overall actions taken by the persons or groups of persons having committed the violation.'\"125 The Respondent therefore asserts that the \"Claimant's allegations that the Republic had put in place a general policy of non-payment of dividends to foreign participants in *Empresas Mixtas* are insufficient to maintain a claim against Respondent.\"126\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 55; Exhibit RLA-153, *Gustav F.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n153.\n\nIt is true that some tribunals have expressed the view that \"[t]he issue of attribution relates both to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to the merits of [the] dispute\".132 Another tribunal took the view that \"[t]he question whether the issue of attribution is, in a given case, one of jurisdiction or of merits is not [...] susceptible of a clear-cut answer.\"133 It added that \"in many instances, questions of attribution and questions of legality are closely intermingled, and it is then difficult to deal with the question of attribution without a full enquiry into the merits.\"134\n\n*Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Award, 10 March 2014, \u00b6 276.\n\nExhibit RLA-153, *Gustav F.W. Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, \u00b6 140.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 143.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that attribution is a concept of international law firmly rooted in the rules on State responsibility. According to the ILC, it is one of the elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State. According to Article 2 of the ILC Articles, entitled *Elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State* :\n\n[t]here is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or omission:\n\n(a) is attributable to the State under international law; and\n\n(b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.135\n\nILC Articles, Article 2.\n\n155.\n\nBoth elements must be established in order to reach the conclusion that an internationally wrongful act has been committed by a State, engaging its international responsibility. Where there is a claim of a breach of an international obligation of a State under a BIT, the claimant has to prove (i) that the conduct complained of is, under international law, attributable to a State, i.e., under international law it is considered to be the conduct of a State; and (ii) that the obligation allegedly breached is an obligation which that State has undertaken under the applicable BIT. There is a breach only when the conduct of a State is not in conformity with what is required of it by an international obligation, provided that there are no circumstances precluding the wrongfulness.136\n\nILC Articles, Articles 12, 20-25.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that, in the present case, it is more appropriate to consider the Parties' arguments on attribution in the context of the merits rather than as an issue of jurisdiction. If the conduct complained of by the Claimant cannot be attributed to the Respondent, then there can be no breach of any of the Respondent's obligations under the BIT and the \"claims should be dismissed\"137, as requested by the Respondent in its prayer for relief.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 125.\n\n157.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent has, at least since 2009,138 directly and through its State-owned companies acting under its direction or control, breached its obligations under the BIT and under international law.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 2.\n\n158.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimant alleges that Venezuela:\n\n(i) failed to guarantee fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant's investment;\n\n(ii) impaired the value of the Claimant's investment by arbitrary and discriminatory measures;\n\n(iii) failed to comply with the legal obligations it and its State-owned enterprises entered into with respect to the Claimant's investment; and\n\n(iv) denied the Claimant the value of its investment and improperly expropriated that investment, without compensation.139\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 14.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider these allegations. It observes at the outset that Venezuela can be held *responsible* only for conduct which is attributable to it under international law and which is not in conformity with what is required of it under the provisions of the BIT. However, before turning to the Claimant's allegations, the Tribunal still has another preliminary issue to deal with, namely the Respondent's contention that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible.140\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 124.\n\n**B. REFERRAL OF DISPUTES TO THE VENEZUELAN COURTS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n160.\n\nEven if the acts and omissions alleged by the Claimant were attributable to the Respondent, the Respondent contends that Claimant's claims remain inadmissible given that Claimant agreed to the condition, included in Annex A to the Conversion Contract, that the Venezuelan courts would decide any dispute related to Petroritupano.141 In addition to this contention, such a condition is also rendered effective, according to the Respondent, through the BIT's \"admission clause\".142 The Respondent contends that the only answer the Claimant offers to this objection is based upon the decision in *Aguas del Tunari*, which, in its view, actually supports the position that a State can condition the admission of the investment on the resolution of related disputes by domestic courts and tribunals.143\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 141-143; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 80:11-23.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 145-146; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 119-122; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 98:8-24, 144:1-146:8; Hearing Transcript (29 November 2017), 258:14-20.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 123; Exhibit CLA-157, *Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the \"Respondent's argument subordinates the BIT to Venezuela's national law\" and contradicts the dispute resolution provision at Article 8 of the BIT, which expressly provides that disputes regarding its breach shall be submitted to international arbitration.144 The inclusion of an admission clause in the BIT does not, according to the Claimant, subvert the effect of Article 8.145 The Claimant asserts that the tribunal in *Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia* studied a broader admission clause and rejected the Respondent's proposed interpretation.146\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 45-50.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 46.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 50-53; Exhibit CLA-157, *Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n162.\n\nAnnex A to the Conversion Contract is a document by which the National Assembly of Venezuela approved the incorporation of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., between CVP, Petrobras Energ\u00eda Venezuela, S.A., APC Venezuela, S.R.L., and Corod Producci\u00f3n, S.A. According to the Annex:\n\n[t]he creation and operation of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., shall be subject to the following Terms and conditions:\n\n[...]\n\n12. The differences and controversies arising from the failure to perform the conditions, rules, procedures and actions that constitute the subject-matter of this document or arising from this document shall be settled in accordance with the legislation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and before its judicial authorities.147\n\nExhibit C-2(A), Acuerdo de la Asamblea Nacional of 4 May 2006.\n\n163.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, this clause establishes the exclusive jurisdiction of the Venezuelan judicial authorities for settling, in accordance with Venezuelan legislation, the dispute regarding the performance, conditions, rules and actions constituting \"the subject-matter of this document\". The subject-matter of the document is the approval of the incorporation of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A. and the establishment of the terms and conditions for its operation. The disputes regarding the document itself (i.e., the Annex to the Conversion Contract) also fall within the jurisdiction of the Venezuelan courts, as the phrase \"[t]he differences and controversies [...] arising from this document\" indicates.\n\n164.\n\nIn this context, it is necessary to quote Clause 11 of Annex A. It provides:\n\nThe other basic terms and conditions that shall govern Petroritupano, S.A., are in the Draft Contract for the Conversion into a Mixed Company and the draft Charter/By-laws which have been submitted for the review of this National Assembly, jointly with the report of the National Executive in relation to the incorporation of Petroritupano, S.A. and the Memorandum of Understanding between Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo, S.A., PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, S.A., Petrobras Energ\u00eda Venezuela, S.A., APC Venezuela, S.R.L. and Corod Producci\u00f3n, S.A. dated March 31, 2006.\n\n165.\n\nAccordingly, the differences and controversies arising from the failure to perform and comply with the basic terms and conditions of the Conversion Contract and Petroritupano Bylaws fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Venezuelan courts. This is in line with, and confirmed by, Article 7 of the Conversion Contract.148 This article on applicable laws and jurisdiction provides that:\n\nthe Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic and any dispute or controversy that may arise with this Contract which cannot be solved by the Parties in a friendly way shall be exclusively submitted to the competent courts of the Republic.\n\nExhibit C-2, Conversion Contract.\n\n166.\n\nFrom the above, it follows that disputes arising from the Conversion Contract and \"from the failure to perform the conditions, rules, procedures and actions which constitute the subject-matter\" of Annex A to the Conversion Contract or arising therefrom, are not admissible before this Tribunal, even if they may otherwise fall within its jurisdiction.\n\n**C.

Venezuela* and *Vivendi v. Argentina* tribunals, which analyzed a similar formulation of the FET standard and held that the reference to the principles of international law in the treaty did not make the standard equal to the minimum standard of treatment.151 In addition, the Claimant highlights that the *Crystallex* and *Gold Reserve* tribunals rejected the formulation of the standard in the *Neer* case cited by the Respondent.152\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 145; Reply, \u00b6 129; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 63:5-64:17.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119; Exhibit CLA-155, *Crystallex International Corp. v.

Venezuela did not act in accordance with any of these expectations.\"159 The Claimant further summarizes its claim as follows:\n\nAnadarko recognized that the Ch\u00e1vez government was hostile to what it perceived as foreign control over petroleum exploration and production. However, in determining to continue VUS's investment in Venezuela as a shareholder in the Petroritupano *empresa mixta*, Anadarko's management expected that the [Government of Venezuela] would abide by the new investment framework the [Government of Venezuela] had designed and enacted. The [Government of Venezuela] had, after all, already restructured the foreign participants' interests to achieve its goal of full control over exploration and production activities in Venezuela. The [Government of Venezuela] and PDVSA had created the forms for the conversion contracts and related instruments governing the *empresas mixtas* containing the basic assurances and protections for minority shareholders upon which VUS relied. And, Venezuela had approved the specific terms of the Conversion Contract and related instruments negotiated and agreed to by PDVSA's affiliates.\n\nIt was reasonable for VUS to rely on the [Government of Venezuela's] and PDVSA's representations and contractual commitments and to expect them to honor those commitments. Venezuela, however, breached its commitments, operated its State organs for its own benefit in derogation of VUS's rights, and frustrated VUS's legitimate expectations. That conduct violated the fair and equitable treatment Venezuela promised to accord to VUS under the BIT.\n\nVenezuela's conduct, directly and through PDVSA and its affiliates, further leaves no doubt it has not acted in good faith in its treatment of VUS's investment.\n\nVenezuela, through PDVSA and its affiliates, intentionally chose not to distribute to VUS its share of Petroritupano's declared dividends, while Venezuela opted, for political expediency, to distribute to Petrobras, the other foreign shareholder, Petrobras's share of those dividends. Venezuela also distributed its share of those dividends to itself, as a credit from PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo to PDVSA CVP. But it pocketed VUS's share for its own use.\n\nVenezuela then caused or allowed its State organs, PDVSA and its affiliates, to manipulate Petroritupano's oil sales and purchases to starve Petroritupano of income while causing it to incur very sizable unauthorized debt. PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo has taken hundreds of millions of dollars in oil without paying for it, while PDVSA CVP caused Petroritupano to accept loans from PDVSA to pay for operating expenses, without shareholder approval. Venezuela engaged in financial obfuscation and manipulation to make it appear Petroritupano suffered losses in order to avoid having to pay dividends to the minority shareholders, denying VUS any return on its investment. It has failed to provide audited financial statements for recent years, declared neither profit nor loss, and not addressed dividends at all.\n\nVenezuela also did not act in good faith with respect to the sale of the investment. Minister Ram\u00edrez denied consent to the indirect transfer of control of VUS's Petroritupano shares to a qualified third-party buyer, without giving any reasons for the denial, at the same time PDVSA said it would buy those shares for the same price as PetroFalcon had agreed to pay. PDVSA did not engage in good faith negotiations regarding that offer, then proceeded to destroy the value of VUS's interest in Petroritupano, making it impossible for VUS to sell its interest, directly or indirectly, to a third party.160\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 159; Reply, \u00b6 130; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 70:8-20; Exhibit CWS-1, Witness Statement of Luis H.

The [Government of Venezuela] and PDVSA put together the *empresa mixta* structure and set the basic terms of the related agreements, and we expected that they would abide by the legislative and contractual structure they had created. I believe that if they agreed to the terms and signed the contracts, they would execute their contractual commitments and perform the agreements as written and agreed. In August 2006, VUS and APC Venezuela executed the Conversion Contract, VUS entered into the Petroritupano shareholder relationship in good faith and with the expectation that the investment would be reasonably successful and profitable going forward. At the same time, Anadarko and VUS expected that the [Government of Venezuela], directly and through PDVSA and its affiliates, would honor its commitments to VUS as a minority shareholder in Petroritupano and as a Barbadian investor in Venezuela.\").\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 160-165; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126, 130-133; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 70:21-71:18.\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent does not deny any of these facts and asserts that \"Respondent has continued this behavior, directly and through the PDVSA companies, breaching its Treaty obligations and magnifying the harm to VUS and its investment,\" all of which has, according to the Claimant, been allegedly confirmed by its expert.161\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 16-25. According to Mr. Kaczmarek, the Respondent manipulated seven key factors driving Petroritupano's financial performance, and affirms that it found that \"at least two of these factors have worsened\" while the others still continue to create losses. In particular, Mr. Kaczmarek noted that \"[a]s of 2015, PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo owed Petroritupano US$1,136 billion for oil delivered but not paid for\", and \"Petroritupano's operating and administrative costs have continued to rise, rapidly and inexplicably by any commercial standards.\"\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \"the scope that Claimant attempts to accord to the FET obligation does not correspond to the text of the Treaty and is incorrect.\"162 Moreover, according to the Respondent, even if the alleged breach of the contractual commitments entered into by CVP and Petroritupano were to be attributed to Venezuela, and even under the expansive FET interpretation advanced by the Claimant, the Respondent has not breached its FET obligation under the BIT.163\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 108.\n\n*Ibid*.; Rejoinder, \u00b6 106.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent first contends that, as established in Article 2.2 of the BIT, the FET is specifically tied to international law, such that it must \"be equated with the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\"164 According to the Respondent, that standard was enunciated in the case of *L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer v. Mexico* where the tribunal held that a breach of the standard requires the treatment of an alien to amount to \"an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"165\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 109; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 99-106; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 127:21-128:11.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 115.

Even if they were, they would not constitute a breach of the FET standard in any event; for a breach of FET to be found, the State would have to \"significantly interfere with a contract through its sovereign powers.\"171\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 117.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 117-119; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 132:11-25; Exhibit RLA-215. *Consortium RFCC v.

Paraguay*, where the tribunal noted that Paraguay, in refusing to pay an outstanding debt, \"had not availed itself of the kinds of powers that are normally available to a sovereign if it wishes to interfere with the rights of an ordinary party\", and then stated that \"time alone, coupled with the repetition of the conduct, [cannot] as such transform the act of a sovereign contracting party into an exercise of sovereign authority.\"174 Similarly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's case \"is nothing more than a contractual claim based on the lack of payment of dividends by Petroritupano or the delay in declaring dividends. Whether this lack of payment has occurred more than once over a period of several years does not change the nature of the contractual claim.\"175 The Respondent also contends that the claim regarding the denial of authorization to the change of control must be rejected. It highlights that the Ministry was expressly entitled to do so under Article 6.3 of the Conversion Contract and Article 12 of Petroritupano's Bylaws and \"never promised to Claimant that the PetroFalcon deal would be authorized.\"176\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 120.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 121.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 121-124; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 133:1-135:9; Exhibit RLA-216, *Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V. v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that VUS' investments consists of a minority equity interest of 18% in a mixed company providing oil production services, Petroritupano, S.A. CVP owns 60% of the equity interest of Petroritupano, whilst two other companies own the remaining 22%.185 CVP is owned in its entirety by PDVSA, whilst the Government of Venezuela owns 100% of PDVSA's shares. Oil produced by Petroritupano is sold exclusively to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo.\n\nExhibit C-3, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., published in the Official Gazette No. 38,518 on 8 September 2006, Article 6; Exhibit C-2, Conversion Contract, Article 1.3.\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Venezuela, through its State organs, PDVSA, CVP, PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo and its control of Petroritupano, breached its obligations under the BIT.186 It asserts that the acts and omissions of PDVSA, CVP, PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, and Petroritupano are attributable to the State.187 In particular, the Claimant alleges that:\n\n(i) Venezuela, through its Minister of Energy and Petroleum, did not allow the Claimant to sell its investment to a third party but would not buy it itself through CVP;188\n\n(ii) Venezuela, through CVP and the control it exercised over Petroritupano, denied distributing the declared Petroritupano dividends for the fiscal years 2008-2009 to the Claimant;189\n\n(iii) Venezuela wrongfully manipulated its relationship with and between its State-owned enterprises and caused them to ignore their contractual obligations, all to have the State benefit over the foreign investors. In particular, [PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo] has failed up to this day to pay Petroritupano for oil purchased and received, and Petroritupano, managed by CVP, did not, and does not insist on payment or exercise its contractual remedies for late payment. It further complains that PDVSA made, and CVP accepted on behalf of Petroritupano, substantial loans to fund ongoing operations, without the other shareholders' approval. Based on these loans and improper charges and taxes, CVP fraudulently asserted to Claimant that Petroritupano suffered losses and could not issue dividends for the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years;190\n\n(iv) CVP has improperly failed to provide financial data for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to the shareholders and to declare profits or losses in furtherance of a purported governmental policy to deny foreign investors the payment of dividends from the mixed companies unless they make additional capital investments to increase production and meet the State's productions goals.191\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 9, 165 (FET) and 214 (expropriation).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 10, 163 (FET), 176 (arbitrary and discriminatory treatment) and 204 (umbrella clause).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 11, 79-82, 164 (FET), 177 (arbitrary and discriminatory treatment) and 214 (expropriation).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 12, 178 (arbitrary and discriminatory treatment) and 213 (expropriation).\n\n182.\n\nThere is little doubt that the act of the Minister of Energy and Petroleum to deny authorization to the Claimant to sell its shares in Petroritupano to a third party (PetroFalcon) is attributable to Venezuela. The Minister of Energy and Petroleum has the status of a State organ in accordance with Venezuelan law and, therefore, his acts are considered acts of Venezuela under international law.192\n\nILC Articles, Article 4.\n\n183.\n\nVenezuela denies that all other acts complained of by the Claimant are attributable to it. It argues that all obligations and alleged breaches asserted by the Claimant exclusively relate to obligations of CVP as a shareholder in Petroritupano, or of Petroritupano itself, in connection with the payment of dividends and the financial situation of Petroritupano.193\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 20.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant asserts that Venezuela committed the acts complained of through CVP and Petroritupano, which is controlled by it through CVP. The Claimant submits that they are *de facto* organs of Venezuela. The Claimant's arguments focus to a large extent on the fact that PDVSA is an organ of Venezuela. However, PDVSA has not itself committed any of the acts complained of by the Claimant; these were acts of CVP and Petroritupano. Therefore, there is no need for the Tribunal to determine the status of PDVSA. The question for the Tribunal to answer is whether the acts of CVP and Petroritupano are attributable to Venezuela.\n\n185.\n\nCVP, a wholly-owned PDVSA's affiliate, is registered as a commercial corporation (\"una sociedad mercantil an\u00f3nima\") in the Commercial Register (\"el Registro de Comercio\").194 CVP concluded the Conversion Contract in its own name, as is clearly indicated in Article 9.1 thereof, which provides that: \"[e]ach Party acknowledges that each one of the other Parties is entering into this Contract in its own name and in its capacity as a legal entity empowered to contract on its own behalf.\"195\n\nExhibit C-46, Decree No. 1127 of the President of Venezuela of 2 September 1975, described by Claimant as CVP Articles of Incorporation (Memorial, fn. 276), Articles 1 and 2.\n\nExhibit C-2, Conversion Contract.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant puts emphasis on the fact that PDVSA and its affiliates were created and are wholly owned by the State. Relying on the *Maffezini* and the *Flemingo* awards, it contends that these factors create a presumption in favour of State control.196 The Respondent maintains that the fact that a company is a State-owned company is clearly not sufficient to consider it as an organ of the State.197 This argument is correct. In the *Maffezini* award, the tribunal recognized that \"the intent of the State to create still another corporate entity, particularly one which is intended to operate in the private sector, even if State-owned, is not sufficient to raise a presumption of an entity being an organ of the State.\"198 The tribunal observed that \"[m]ore is required in terms of the functional test\"199 that looks into the functions, or the role to be performed by, the corporate entity.200\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120, Reply, \u00b6 68.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 33, referring to Exhibit RLA-135, J. Crawford, State Responsibility, The General Part, p. 118, where he states: \"Mere ownership of an entity by a [S]tate, however, will not automatically convert that entity into an organ of the [S]tate.\"\n\nExhibit CLA-21, *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, \u00b6 84.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 79.\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimant's argument that PDVSA's and CVP's funds are public because these companies are wholly State-owned cannot be accepted. PDVSA, CVP, and Petroritupano have legal personalities and patrimonies of their own, are subject to the payment of taxes and contributions, and are governed by their own corporate documents. In fact, no evidence has been adduced to show that the companies in question lack financial autonomy. Under Article 303 of the Venezuelan Constitution, the State shall retain all shares of the PDVSA, but it does not own the latter's assets and funds, which are owned by PDVSA itself. As far as CVP is concerned, the State does not even own the shares in CVP, they are owned by PDVSA. According to the same provision of the Venezuelan Constitution, the State cannot be a shareholder in \"subsidiaries [or affiliates; in the original Spanish: \"las filiales\"], strategic associations, business enterprises and any other venture established or subsequently established as a consequence of the development of the businesses of [PDVSA]\".201\n\nExhibit C-40, Exhibit RLA-159, Venezuelan Constitution, Article 303.\n\n188.\n\nRegarding the functional test, the Claimant argues that the companies in question are to be considered *de facto* organs of Venezuela because they are empowered to perform functions reserved to the State by the Venezuelan Constitution and the Hydrocarbons Law.202 It is true that under Article 302 of the Venezuelan Constitution, \"the State reserves the right to carry out activities related to the oil industry\".203 However, it does not necessarily follow from this provision that the companies carrying these activities are to be considered State organs, not even *de facto*, as argued by Claimant. PDVSA and CVP engage predominantly in seemingly commercial transactions and they are, and operate as, private entities under domestic law. The Tribunal cannot conclude that they constitute organs of the State on the basis of their functions.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 131 citing Exhibit C-40, Venezuelan Constitution, Articles 302-303, and Exhibit C-5, Hydrocarbons Law, Article 1.\n\nExhibit C-40, Venezuelan Constitution, Article 302.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimant adduces several arguments in support of its submission that PDVSA and its subsidiaries form part of the Venezuelan State. It argues that Venezuela \"guide[s] the policies\" and \"exercise[s] coordination and control functions\" over PDVSA and its affiliates pursuant to domestic law applicable to State-owned companies.204 It contends that PDVSA is required to follow the guidelines, plans and strategies of the National Executive through the Energy Ministry according to its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.205\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 129.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 130 referring to Exhibit C-76, PDVSA Bylaws, Decree No. 8327 (24 May 2011), Article 2 \"The performance of the social purpose shall be carried out according to the guidelines and policies that the National Executive, through the People's Ministry for Energy and Petroleum, establishes or agrees pursuant to the faculties conferred by law.\".\n\n190.\n\nWith respect to CVP, the Claimant asserts that CVP manages Petroritupano pursuant to the Energy Ministry's and PDVSA's instructions and interests.206 In this context, the Claimant refers to statements from PDVSA's website describing CVP's role as \"control[ling] the business with domestic and international private companies [...] while maximizing the value of hydrocarbons for the Venezuelan [S]tate.\"207\n\nMemorial, \u00b6140.\n\nReply, \u00b6 64 referring to Exhibit C-106.\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimant further stresses that the presidents and boards of directors of PDVSA and CVP are appointed by decree of the President of Venezuela.208 However, as the Respondent explains, PDVSA's board of directors is appointed by the State as its sole shareholder. CVP's board of directors is then appointed by PDVSA as its sole shareholder.209\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 130 and 137.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 47.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that all these factors, even if combined, do not support the conclusion that PDVSA, still less CVP and Petroritupano, are State organs and that on this basis their acts can be attributed to Venezuela. The evidence submitted by the Claimant only demonstrates that the State is the owner of the entirety of PDVSA's shares, and that the Venezuelan oil industry is highly regulated. The appointment and dismissal of board members by the State as the sole shareholder of PDVSA is not sufficient to call for the lifting of corporate veil. It may be noted that the Claimant itself admits that \"PDVSA might, at one point during the *apertura petr\u00f3lera*, have been considered a commercial company.\"210 This implies that the right of the State to appoint the board members of the PDVSA is not dispositive of its characterization as a State organ. The link with CVP is even more tenuous as its board of directors is appointed by PDVSA, not by the State.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 134.\n\n193.\n\nIt is to be noted that in both the *Ampal-American* and *Flemingo* cases, to which the Claimant refers,211 further restrictions were applicable on the decision-making processes of the State-owned companies in question, namely, that all their board decisions or all their contracts required governmental ratification or approval.212 It has not been shown that this was the case here.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Exhibit CLA-159, *Ampal-American Israel Corp, EGI Series Investors LLC, EGI-Fund (08-10) Investors LLC, and BSS-EMG Investors LLC* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, \u00b6 138(iv); Exhibit CLA-158, *Flemingo Duty Free Shop Private Limited* v. *The Republic of Poland*, PCA Case No. 2014-11, Award, 12 August 2016, \u00b6 427. It may be noted that while the tribunal in the *Ampal-American* award found that the wholly State-owned oil company (EGPC) was a State organ, it did not consider EGPC's wholly-owned subsidieary (EGAS) to be a State organ as well, but rather attributed the latter's conduct to Egypt under ILC Article 8 because, \"the relevant acts of EGAS were directed by the Respondent or adopted by it as its own conduct\" (Exhibit CLA-159, *Ampal-American Israel Corp, EGI Series Investors LLC, EGI-Fund (08-10) Investors LLC, and BSS-EMG Investors LLC* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 138-140, 269).\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question whether the conduct in question can be attributed to the Respondent on the basis of the rule formulated in Article 5 of the ILC Articles. That rule provides that:\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise the elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n195.\n\nBoth Parties accept213 that two cumulative conditions must be met for conduct of an entity to be attributable to the State, namely that:\n\na) the entity is empowered by the law of the State to exercise elements of governmental authority; and\n\nb) the conduct was carried out by that entity in that capacity in that particular instance.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 116; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 41.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that PDVSA, CVP, and Petroritupano have \"authority to perform public functions reserved to the State under the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution and the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law\".214 It contends in particular that the \"sovereign authority encompasses all activities in the exploration, production and exploitation of hydrocarbons\" as they are all acts reserved solely to the State under domestic law.215 It further argues that \"by statute PDVSA and CVP control and manage all aspects of the Mixed Companies [and] the Mixed Companies are required to sell their production to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, which serves its own role in the sovereign scheme.\"216 The Claimant asserts that all acts of which it complains \"fall within the scope of [Venezuela's] sovereign authority over the petroleum sector and the Mixed Companies.\"217\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 135, 138, 141; Exhibit C-5, Hydrocarbons Law, Article 1; Exhibit C-40, Venezuelan Constitution, Articles 302-303.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 61 and 71 citing Exhibit C-5, Hydrocarbons Law, Article 22.\n\nReply, \u00b6 71.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n197.\n\nVenezuela responds that the Claimant \"cannot identify a single provision of Venezuelan law granting PDVSA and its affiliates specific governmental authority under which they were allegedly acting in connection with the actions that it alleges constituted wrongdoing by PDVSA, PSVSA Petr\u00f3leo, CVP or Petroritupano.\"218 It maintains that \"a delay or failure to pay dividends is, by its nature, of a commercial character that can occur in the management of any commercial company.\"219 It further argues that \"governmental authority\" should not be equated with activities of a commercial character routinely carried out by State-owned companies.220\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 43.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 42.\n\n198.\n\nThe concept of \"governmental authority\" is not defined in the ILC Articles. What, however, is required, is that the law of the State authorizes an entity to exercise some aspects of that State's power, that is, public authority. The provisions relied on by the Claimant do not provide support to the assertion that State-owned or mixed companies are vested with governmental authority. Article 303 of the Venezuelan Constitution is the only provision that mentions PDVSA, but it does not seem to empower it to exercise any elements of governmental authority. It only compels the State to retain all shares of PDVSA.221\n\nExhibit C-40, Venezuelan Constitution, Article 303.\n\n199.\n\nThe acts complained of, namely that Petroritupano failed to distribute dividends and provide financial data to the Claimant for several fiscal years due to CVP's mismanagement that consisted of incurring unexplained expenses and borrowing operating funds from PDVSA or CVP,222 are not acts carried out in the exercise of governmental authority and are not envisaged in the provisions invoked by the Claimant.223\n\nSee \u00b6182 above.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 61 and 99, see Exhibit C-5, Hydrocarbons Law, Article 22.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant's contention that Petroritupano's failure to collect payment and impose interests on deliverables from PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo is an act carried out in the exercise of governmental authority.224 In support of this contention, the Claimant points out that \"Petroritupano [...] has acted against any concept of commercial reasonableness.\"225 The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's view that whether commercial activities are profitable or not is not the applicable test for finding that a State company is exercising governmental authority.226 The Claimant's argument relates to the exercise of purely private rights by Petroritupano against PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo and therefore cannot be accepted.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 78; Reply, \u00b6 74.\n\nReply, \u00b6 73.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that none of the acts complained of by the Claimant have been carried out in the exercise of governmental authority under Venezuelan law and therefore that they cannot be attributed to the Respondent.\n\n202.\n\nTurning now to the issue of whether the conduct complained of was carried out on the instructions of, or under the directions or control of, Venezuela, the Tribunal notes that it is not disputed that the conduct of a person or group of persons is attributable to a State \"if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"227 The ILC, in its Commentary on Article 8 of the ILC Articles in relation to State-owned and controlled companies, recalled that \"international law acknowledges the general separateness of corporate entities at the national level, except in those cases where the 'corporate veil' is a mere device or vehicle for fraud or evasion.\"228 It has made clear that \"[t]he fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity, whether by a special law of otherwise, is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity.\"229 As the ILC explains, \"[s]ince corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, *prima facie* their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.\"230 The ILC, however, also noted that \"where there was evidence [...] that the State was using its ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the conduct in question has been attributed to the State.\"231 The determination has to be made in each case on the basis of the facts relating to the relationship between the instruction given or the direction or control exercised and the specific conduct complained of which is said to have amounted to an internationally wrongful act.232\n\nILC Articles, Article 8.\n\nILC Articles, Article 8, Commentary, \u00b6 6, referring to *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited, Second Phase*, 1970 ICJ REPORTS 3, p. 39, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*., referring to *Foremost Tehran, Inc.* v. *Islamic Republic of Iran*, 10 Iran-U.S.C.T.R. 228 (1986); *American Bell International, Inc.* v. *Islamic Republic of Iran*, 12 Iran-U.S.C.T.R. 170 (1986).\n\n*Ibid*., Article 8, Commentary, \u00b6 7.\n\n203.\n\nAs to the circumstances relating to a possible transfer of the Claimant's shares in Petroritupano (which, however, did not materialize), communications between the Claimant and CVP corroborate the fact that the decision for the expression of interest in the acquisition of Claimant's investment was made by PDVSA.233 However, both witness statements submitted by the Claimant suggest that a CVP representative disclosed to them that Minister of Energy and Petroleum Ram\u00edrez would not provide his consent for the transfer of the Claimant's investment to a third party (PetroFalcon), and authorized PDVSA to make an offer.234 Venezuela did not provide any information in this respect in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder. The Tribunal considers that it is not denied that the expression of interest in the acquisition of the Claimant's shares in Petroritupano was authorized by the Energy Minister and thus was made under his control.\n\nExhibit C-62, Letter of E. Del Pino (CVP) to S. Akers (Anadarko) and L. Derrota (VUS) (6 October 2008); Exhibit C-24, E-mail from E. Del Pino (CVP) to T.

Carroll, \u00b6 12.\n\n204.\n\nWith respect to the non-payment of dividends for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, there is no evidence in the record that Venezuela instructed or directed Petroritupano or CVP not to pay dividends to the Claimant.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimant further complains that Petroritupano wrote off receivables owed to it by PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo \"'[o]n instructions received by the management of CVP' (from whom is unsaid)\" in the amount which was credited to CVP as the dividends for its shares in Petroritupano.235 In the Claimant's view, this act is attributable to Venezuela. The Claimant relies on an excerpt from Petroritupano's financial statement which reads: \"[b]y instruction received by the Management of CVP, the Company proceeded to offset the accounts receivable resulting from the sales of crude oil to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo against the accounts payable to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo for labor costs and operating expense; said offset included the offset of dividends payable to CVP.\"236 This evidence is at best inconclusive. It only shows that the write-off was done on the instructions of the Management of CVP, but it does not prove that CVP acted on the Government of Venezuela's instructions.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 75; Reply, \u00b6 79.\n\nExhibit C-73, Petroritupano Financial Statement 2011, at p. 35.\n\n206.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that Petroritupano did not pay dividends to the Claimant in carrying out Venezuela's policy not to pay dividends to foreign investors in mixed companies unless and until they made additional capital contributions in an effort to boost PDVSA's falling production levels.237 Venezuela denies that such general policy ever existed, pointing to the fact that the Claimant relies on news reports to substantiate its claim.238 It is true that the statement by the Energy Minister on the need to increase output of mixed companies if dividends were to be paid was reported in the press,239 and there is no evidence that this was controverted by the Government of Venezuela or the Energy Minister. The Tribunal, however, considers that the link between the Energy Minister's Statement reported in 2012 and 2013 and CVP's and Petroritupano's non-distribution of dividends for 2008 and 2009 to the Claimant, is at most tenuous. The Claimant's witness acknowledged that no such policy was ever communicated to VUS.240 Such communication would have been necessary, by logical implication, if the Government of Venezuela wished to achieve its objective and induce foreign shareholders to contribute to the capital strengthening the position of the mixed companies.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90; Reply, \u00b6 80.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 56 and 83.\n\nExhibit C-34, \"*Venezuela says no dividends for underperforming oil partners*\", REUTERS (13 June 2013); Exhibit C-35, \"*Ministry of Petroleum to pay dividends only if output is raised*\", EL UNIVERSAL (14 June 2013).\n\nExhibit CWS-1, Witness Statement of Luis H. Derrota, \u00b6 46.\n\n207.\n\nOn the basis of the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that none of the acts complained of by the Claimant, with the exception of the Energy Minister's refusal to give consent to the transfer of the Claimant's shares in Petroritupano to a qualified third party (PetroFalcon), and his authorization to PDVSA to express interest in acquiring these shares, are attributable to Venezuela.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Claimant agreed in the Conversion Contract that \"no direct or indirect transfer of its control shall be made [...] within the term of the Mixed Company right to carry out Primary Activities as set forth in the Acuerdo of the National Assembly, without the prior written consent from the Minister\".241 The Claimant also agreed that if it fails to comply with such duty, its \"interests in the Mixed Company shall be deemed as terminated and all its shares in the Mixed Company shall be transferred to CVP, entailing no duty to CVP as to pay any amount whatsoever for the transferred shares.\"242 From the factual record before the Tribunal, it appears that when the Claimant's request for the written consent with the transaction was pending before the Minister, CVP informed the Claimant of PDVSA's interest in buying the Claimant's 18% interest in Petroritupano.243 A meeting was arranged between the representatives of the parties on 1 September 2008. On 17 September 2008, the Minister, by a letter addressed to Claimant, denied the consent, \"by the powers vested in [him] under Section 6.3 of the [Conversion Contract]\".244 On 6 October 2008, the President of CVP confirmed to Anadarko PDVSA's interest in acquiring all the shares of Anadarko Venezuela Company and requested a formal proposal.245 Anadarko responded to that request and proposed to sell Anadarko Venezuela Company to PDVSA for US$ 200 million.246 There was no answer to that proposal nor any further meetings to discuss a possible deal. As confirmed by the Associate General Counsel-International for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, who was responsible for supervising legal issues with respect to the investment of Venezuela US in Venezuela, \"[s]ince then, Anadarko has not had any further discussions with PDVSA or any of its affiliates, or with any representative of Venezuela, regarding PDVSA's expressed intent to purchase VUS's interest in Petroritupano.\"247\n\nExhibit C-2, Conversion Contract, Article 6.3.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nExhibit C-24, E-mail from E.

For instance, the payment of the dividends and other distributions is governed by Article 32 of Petroritupano's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,249 and the convocation and the powers of the General Meeting of Shareholders (\"Asambleas de Accionistas\") by Chapter III thereof,250 while Chapter IV governs the matters relating to the Management of Petroritupano, including the composition of its Board of Directors, its meetings, required quorum and its powers.251 Any matters not provided for in these Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, according to their Article 36, shall be governed by the applicable laws of Venezuela. That article further specifies that \"[u]nless otherwise required by the applicable provisions of Public Law, the Company shall be governed by Private Law, including, among the latter, the applicable provisions of the Commercial Code.\"252 Moreover, Mr. Luis Humberto Derrota, Associate General Counsel-International for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, \"responsible for legal issues arising in connection with [Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's] and its subsidiaries' international activities, including with respect to their interests in Venezuela,\"253 was appointed Alternate Director on Petroritupano's Board of Directors.254 It therefore appears that the Claimant was represented on Petroritupano's Board of Directors.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12, 16-17.\n\nExhibit C-3, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., published in the Official Gazette No. 38,518 on 8 September 2006, Article 32.\n\n*Ibid*., Articles 13-18.\n\n*Ibid*., Articles 19-26.\n\n*Ibid*., Article 36.\n\nExhibit CWS-1, Witness Statement of Luis H.

This flows from paragraph 11 of Annex A which reads: \"[t]he *other* basic terms that shall govern Petroritupano are in the Draft Contract for the draft Charter/By-laws which have been submitted for the review of this to the National Assembly\".257\n\nExhibit C-2, Conversion Contract, Article 7.\n\nExhibit C-2(A), Conversion Contract, Annex A, \u00b6 12.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 11, emphasis added.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it cannot uphold the Claimant's claim that the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT to accord the Claimant's investment fair and equitable treatment.\n\n***(b) Arbitrary or Discriminatory Conduct***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimant begins by arguing that Article 2 of the BIT contains a specific prohibition against arbitrary or discriminatory conduct.258 According to the Claimant, in order to violate this provision, a measure need only be arbitrary or discriminatory but not both, and proof of a discriminatory intent is not necessary.259 It explains that \"[r]egardless of the intent behind Venezuela's and PDVSA's acts, those measures clearly put VUS in a worse position than the other shareholders in Petroritupano \u2013 particularly PDVSA CVP \u2013 and in a worse position than shareholders in other *empresas mixtas* which have not suffered the denial of dividends and other wrongful treatment to which Venezuela has subjected VUS's investment.\"260 Specifically, the Claimant contends that (i) VUS was the only shareholder to whom CVP did not distribute any part of the dividends for the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years261 and (ii) PDVSA and its affiliates \"engag[ed] in a scheme [...] to make it appear that Petroritupano suffered losses, while taking the full value of Petroritupano's oil for itself\", the effect of which was compounded by the \"unapproved 'loans' from PDVSA to Petroritupano and other improper manipulations of Petroritupano's finances.\"262 The Respondent also argues that Venezuela's policy of not paying dividends to foreign investors until they invest additional capital is discriminatory.263\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 166.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 167-174; Reply, \u00b6 136; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 71:20-72:23.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 176; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 137; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 72:24-73:4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 177; Reply, \u00b6 18; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 73:5-11.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 178.\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the standard definition of arbitrariness in international law is the one found in the *ELSI* case where it was described as \"a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.\"264 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant is \"unable to point to any act of the Republic that would have impaired its investment, and instead repeats its disagreements with the manner CVP and Petroritupano have managed the business\", which cannot be attributed to Venezuela, do not imply the exercise of sovereign power, and do not amount to the threshold of Article 2.2 of the BIT.265 The Respondent asserts that the fact that \"[m]any oil companies around the world continue to participate in the oil industry in Venezuela, including some of the biggest oil companies in the world\" contradicts the Claimant's allegations of discrimination against foreigners.266\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 137; Exhibit RLA-181, *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A (ELSI)*, Judgment, 1989 ICJ REPORTS 15.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 139-140; Rejoinder, \u00b6 118.\n\nHearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 97:13-19.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal has already analysed the issue of whether the acts complained of by the Claimant can be attributed to Venezuela. It concluded that none of PDVSA, CVP, or Petroritupano can be considered State organs, nor have they been empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, and thus that their acts cannot be attributed to the Respondent on the basis of Article 4 or 5 of the ILC Articles. The Tribunal further concluded that the Claimant had not adduced enough evidence to show that the various acts and omissions of PDVSA, CVP, and Petroritupano occurred on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, the Respondent. That analysis was conducted in the context of the allegation that the Respondent had failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant's investment.\n\n216.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the same conclusion applies to the conduct relied on by the Claimant for its claim that it has been a \"victim\" of discriminatory and arbitrary treatment. There is, however, one exception relating to the non-payment of dividends to the Claimant for the 2008 and 2009 fiscal years.\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, while it has not been paid the dividends for 2008 and 2009, another foreign investor, Petrobras Argentina, did receive the payment of the dividends for 2008 and 2009.267 In support of this assertion, the Claimant submitted evidence268 and a witness statement,269 which remains unrebutted.270\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 72-74; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\nExhibit C-27, PDVSA Power Point presentation, Petroritupano Board of Directors Meeting on 19 May 2011 (slides 92-93); Exhibit C-73, Petroritupano, S.A.

Derrota, \u00b6 37.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent during the exchanges concerning the requests for document production confirmed that the dividends for 2008 and 2009 were paid to Petrobras Argentina when it stated in relation to Request No. 9 that \"there is no dispute among the parties that Petrobras was paid dividends for fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\" Procedural Order No. 3, 11 April 2017, Annex A, p. 13.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the dividends were paid to Petrobras Argentina, which is a subsidiary of the Brazilian company Petrobras, because the Government of Venezuela \"needed to curry favour with the Government of Brazil [and] President Ch\u00e1vez planned an official State visit to Brazil for early June 2011, with a subsequent visit of Brazil's President to Venezuela for a meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in early July, during which Venezuela planned to execute several cooperation and commercial agreements with Brazil.\"271\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 74 referring to Exhibit C-28, \"*Venezuela and Brazil Deepen Strategic Cooperation*\", VENEZUELANANALYSIS.COM (7 June 2011); Exhibit C-29, \"*Brazilian president to visit Caracas in July*\", EL UNIVERSAL (11 May 2011); Exhibit C-30, \"*Ch\u00e1vez confirms June visit to Brazil*\", XINHUANET (25 May 2011).\n\n219.\n\nThe Respondent does not address the payment of the dividends for 2008 and 2009 to Petrobras Argentina. It does not contradict the factual circumstances concerning this payment as invoked by the Claimant. Instead, the Respondent limits itself to the statement that:\n\n[the] Claimant is [...] unable to point to any act of the Republic that would have impaired its investment272\n\nand that\n\n[the] Claimant cannot carry its burden of proving arbitrary or discriminatory action on the part [...] of the Republic.273\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 139.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 118.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that the payment of the declared dividends for 2008 and 2009 to Petrobras Argentina, a subsidiary of the major Brazilian company Petrobras, on the eve of the visit by the President of Venezuela to Brazil during which cooperation in energy matters was discussed, as confirmed by the President himself, is a mere coincidence.274 According to the press reports, it was expected that \"[o]ne of the highlights of the meeting should be the issue of the oil refinery 'Abreu e Lima' which is being built in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. The project is originally considered as a joint enterprise, but Venezuela had not made financial contributions so far to it.\"275\n\nExhibit C-28, \"*Venezuela and Brazil Deepen Strategic Cooperation*\", VENEZUELANANALYSIS.COM (7 June 2011).\n\nExhibit C-30, \"*Ch\u00e1vez confirms June visit to Brazil\"*, XINHUANET (25 May 2011).\n\n221.\n\nAlthough there is a general rule that it is for the party which alleges a fact in support of its claims to prove the existence of that fact, as the International Court of Justice stated:\n\nit would be wrong to regard this rule, based on the maxim *onus probandi actori*, as an absolute one, to be applied in all circumstances. The determination of the burden of proof is in reality dependent on the subject-matter and the nature of each dispute.276\n\n*Amadou Sadio Diallo (Guinea* v. *Democratic Republic of Congo),* Merits, Judgment, 2010 ICJ REPORTS 639, p. 660, \u00b6 54.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant has established that the dividends for 2008 and 2009 were paid to Petrobras in 2011 shortly before the visit of the Venezuelan President to Brazil to discuss, among other things, cooperation in energy matters. It would be too much to ask from it to adduce direct proof that this payment was carried out under the instruction of the Venezuelan Government. The Government of Venezuela, no doubt, was in a position to make that instruction, as Petroritupano is controlled by CVP, which in turn is controlled by PDVSA, wholly-owned by the State. PDVSA's Chairman at the relevant time was the Minister of Energy and Petroleum. There is thus a presumption that the payment was made under the instruction of the Government of Venezuela. The Respondent was in a position to request explanations from PDVSA and CVP for the payment made to Petrobras in 2011. The Respondent, however, did not provide any explanations on this matter. In view of the above, the Tribunal is convinced that the payment of the dividends to Petrobras was made on the instructions of the Government of Venezuela.\n\n223.\n\nThe BIT, in its Article 2, paragraph 2, prohibits discriminatory treatment when it provides that \"[n]either Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\" The BIT does not define discriminatory measures or treatment. Discrimination usually occurs when people or companies in similar situations are treated differently without any valid reason. As the Tribunal in *Saluka* observed, \"State conduct is discriminatory, if (i) similar cases are (ii) treated differently (iii) and without reasonable justification.\"277 Usually, the discrimination is based on the nationality of the foreign investor.278 The Respondent accepts the above standard.279\n\nExhibit CLA-71, *Saluka Investments B.V.* v. *The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 313.\n\nSee Exhibit RLA-223, UNCTAD *Most-Favored-Nation Treatment*, UNCTAD SERIES ON ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS II (2010), p. 27.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 138.\n\n224.\n\nWhile the Claimant, Venezuela US, SRL, a company organized and existing under the laws of Barbados, did not receive the payment of the declared dividends for 2008 and 2009, Venezuela caused the payment of the dividends for the same fiscal year to another foreign investor participating in Petroritupano, namely Petrobras Argentina, a subsidiary of Petrobras, a Brazilian company. This conduct was not in conformity with Venezuela's obligations under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT as it impaired the enjoyment of the Claimant's investment by a discriminatory measure. The Tribunal thus concludes that Venezuela breached its obligations under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT.\n\n***(c) Umbrella Clause***\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Venezuela breached its obligations under the BIT's umbrella clause. It explains that, as with all treaty provisions the umbrella clause should be interpreted \"in accordance with its ordinary meaning, with due regard for its context and the object and purpose of the Treaty\", and that it \"protects foreign investors against the violation of or interference with contractual rights with respect to investments.\"280 In particular, the Claimant asserts that \"its placement in Article 2, alongside other substantive guarantees like 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' [and] the history and modern application of that clause in other BITs illustrate that the very purpose of this provision is to ensure that a State's violation of a contract that relates to foreign investment constitutes an international wrong, and thus an actionable wrong under the Treaty,\" regardless of the State's exercise of sovereign powers.281\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 179-180; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 73:12-74:2.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 182-194.\n\n226.\n\nIn any case, the Claimant asserts that even under a restrictive interpretation of the clause, \"PDVSA's and its affiliates' breaches of their contractual obligation go far beyond the merely commercial and well into the realm of the sovereign [...] The State-enterprises' breaches of the contractual obligations they undertook on behalf of Venezuela were at the direction and for the benefit of the sovereign.\"282\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 195.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant contends as well that \"the umbrella clause obligation extends to the contractual commitments of PDVSA and its affiliates, since, as established above, their conduct was and is fully attributable to Venezuela, both at the time they entered into contractual obligations and at the time they breached those contracts.\"283 To support such an argument, the Claimant cites the case of *Noble Ventures v. Romania*, where the tribunal concluded that, as the execution of the contracts under analysis were attributable to the State, those contracts constituted obligations of Romania under the umbrella clause.284 The Claimant also refers to *Garanti Koza* for the proposition that \"international law clearly recognizes that a breach of commitments subject to an umbrella clause is a breach of the treaty, not a breach of contract.\"285\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 196.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 197-199; Exhibit CLA-65, *Noble Ventures v.

Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Award, 19 December 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 328-332.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the umbrella clause applies regardless of any contractual forum-selection clause since its purpose is precisely to \"provide for an extra, and neutral, mechanism for the enforcement of claims.\"286 According to the Claimant, the forum selection clauses included in the Conversion Contract and in other related agreements are thus of no relevance.287\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 200-201; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 202; Reply, \u00b6 141.\n\n229.\n\nOn the basis of the above construction of the umbrella clause, the Claimant argues that \"Venezuela must ensure that it and its State enterprises acting on behalf of the State or exercising governmental authority, and those enterprises it directs or controls, meet their obligations with respect to the Conversion Contract, Petroritupano's Bylaws, and the Hydrocarbons Purchase and Sale Contract. In failing to do so, as detailed herein, it has breached the requirements of the BIT.\"288 In particular, the Claimant alleges:\n\nActing on behalf of and as part of the [Government of Venezuela], PDVSA and its affiliates refused to pay to VUS the declared Petroritupano dividends for fiscal years 2008 and 2009, and failed and refused to determine and declare dividends for all fiscal years since 2009, in breach of their obligations under the Conversion Contract and Petroritupano's Bylaws. PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo failed to pay sums due and owing for oil under the Hydrocarbons PSA, depriving Petroritupano of its sole source of income, and PDVSA CVP, as Petroritupano's manager, acquiesced in that default. These State enterprises also engaged in a scheme of undisclosed \"loans\" and fees designed to deprive VUS of the value of and returns from its investment. Acting on behalf of the [Government of Venezuela] and with governmental authority, PDVSA and its affiliates improperly manipulated and misrepresented Petroritupano's finances, and otherwise breached their obligations to VUS and its investment.289\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 203; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 74:3-13.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 204.\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n230.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's interpretation of the umbrella clause is incorrect because breaches of contracts do not automatically give rise to breaches of the BIT, especially where, as here, the State is not a party to those contracts.\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondent explains that arbitral tribunals, such as *SGS v. Pakistan*, *Hamester v. Ghana*, and the *CMS* annulment committee, have rejected such equivalence between contract and treaty breaches,, holding that \"the effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else\" and that the parties to the obligation \"are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.\"290 The Respondent relies on this jurisprudence to argue that CVP or Petroritupano cannot be substituted by the Republic or PDVSA in the former's contracts with the Claimant. Thus, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's claims fail because the \"Claimant has failed to prove that the alleged breaches of the Conversion Contract and Petroritupano's By-laws can be considered sovereign acts of the Republic.\"291 Moreover, in the Respondent's view, even if it was possible to automatically consider a breach of the contract as a breach of the treaty, there could not be a breach of the umbrella clause because the contracts under analysis were not entered into with Venezuela.292\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 79-83; Exhibit RLA-166, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimant invokes the following provision of the BIT, which it asserts Venezuela breached:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.298\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that \"an umbrella clause in a BIT protects foreign investors against the violation of, or interference with, contractual rights with respect to investment.\"299 The Claimant further points out that \"the very purpose of this provision is to ensure that a State's violation of a contract that relates to foreign investment constitutes an international wrong, and thus an actionable wrong under the Treaty.\"300\n\nExhibit C-1, BIT, Article 2, \u00b6 2; Memorial, \u00b6 179.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 180.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 182.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Venezuela has not entered into any contractual relationship with the Claimant regarding its investment in Petroritupano. The Conversion Contract was concluded by CVP, Petrobras Energ\u00eda Venezuela, S.A., Petrobras Argentina, APC Venezuela, S.R.L., the Claimant, and Corod Producci\u00f3n, S.A.301 Article 9.1 expressly provides that:\n\nEach Party acknowledges that each one of the other Parties is entering this Contract in its *own name* and in its capacity as a *legal entity empowered to contract on its own behalf*.302\n\nExhibit C-2, Conversion Contract.\n\n*Ibid*., emphasis added.\n\n236.\n\nSince Venezuela has not entered into any contractual obligation with respect to the Claimant's investment, it could not have breached any contract. At any rate, the Tribunal found earlier that the acts and omissions of PDVSA, CVP and Petroritupano, in relation to the Claimant's investment, were not attributable to Venezuela.\n\n237.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal cannot uphold the Claimant's claim that Venezuela breached the umbrella clause contained in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT.\n\n***(d) Expropriation***\n-----------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that \"Venezuela subjected VUS's investment to measures having the effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation, and it did so for other than a legitimate public purpose, on a discriminatory basis, and without prompt, adequate, and effective compensation.\"303 The Claimant avers that, even if a State does not purport to expropriate an investor's rights, it may \"by its actions, render those rights so useless that it will be deemed to have expropriated them.\"304 In addition, the Claimant notes that Article 5 of the BIT expressly covers measures that \"have the equivalent effect\" of expropriation.305\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 206; Reply, \u00b6 143.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 208; Exhibit CLA-122.

Pakistan* recognized as much in the context of an expropriation claim.315 The Respondent contends that the \"Claimant has not even alleged that such sovereign powers have been used by the Republic with respect to its investment in Petroritupano.\"316 According to the Respondent, the Claimant restricted its argument to the fact that \"Petroritupano and PDVSA's affiliates conduct is in breach of the Conversion Contract and Petroritupano's By-laws and that this conduct must be attributed to the Republic.\"317 The Respondent insists that \"such breach cannot amount to an indirect expropriation\" in the absence of direct State interference.318 The Respondent adds that a similar claim was rejected by the *Waste Management* tribunal, which held that \"[a] failing enterprise is not expropriated just because debts are not paid or other contractual obligations are not fulfilled.\"319\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 141:13-142:23; Exhibit RLA-130, *Impregilo S.p.A v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004.\n\n244.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimant cannot have been expropriated as it remains a shareholder of Petroritupano and in possession of its claim for the 2008-2009 dividends.320 According to the Respondent, the Claimant's claim for loss of value \"fails to consider, among other important factors, the declining volume of oil produced by Petroritupano and the fluctuation of the Price of oil in the international market, and their repercussions on the value of Petroritupano's equity.\"321\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 106; Rejoinder, \u00b6 95; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 95:3-10.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 96; Hearing Transcript (28 November 2017), 94:21-95:2.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimant does not assert the direct expropriation of its investment by Venezuela. It still owns its investment in Petroritupano, as confirmed by the witness statement of the Associate General Counsel-International for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. In his second witness statement, he writes that \"VUS remains a shareholder in the Venezuelan mixed company Petroritupano S.A., with respect to which [he] continue[s] to hold the position of Alternate Director.\"322\n\nExhibit CWS-4, Second Witness Statement of Luis H. Derrota, \u00b6 3.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant is thus alleging the indirect expropriation of its investment which, it is argued, occurred because Venezuela \"substantially deprived VUS of the use and enjoyment of its property, benefits and rights in Petroritupano and the returns from that investment.\"323 The Claimant specifies that it has been deprived through a discriminatory action of its share of declared dividends from Petroritupano for fiscal years 2008 and 2009.324\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 212,\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the Respondent, by causing the payment of the declared dividends for 2008 and 2009 to Petrobras Argentina while the Claimant did not receive any payment of such dividends for the same period, did not act in conformity with its obligations under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT.325 The Tribunal, however, does not consider that this conduct of the Respondent amounts to indirect expropriation. The Claimant remained the owner of 18% of the shares in Petroritupano. It is on this basis \u2013 as owner of the shares \u2013 that the Claimant asserts that \"[f]or the subsequent years, Venezuela deprived VUS of returns from Petroritupano in the form of dividends that should have been declared.\"326\n\nSee \u00b6 225 above.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 213.\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the decision on the distribution of the dividends is to be made by Petroritupano, which is a commercial entity with its own legal personality distinct from Venezuela. As determined above by the Tribunal, Petroritupano's acts are not attributable to the Respondent.327 In the view of the Tribunal, the failure by Petroritupano to declare dividends in the years subsequent to 2009 and the complains by Venezuela US regarding that failure are disputes between the parties to the Conversion Contract. They cannot form the basis for any claim of indirect expropriation by the Respondent.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6193,200,208above.\n\n249.\n\nThe complaints that CVP, as Petroritupano's manager, accepted loans from PDVSA for Petroritupano to cover operating costs, which were replete with excessive costs and fees and the failure of PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo to pay Petroritupano for the oil received,328 fall in the same category of commercial disputes that cannot, in the present case, form the basis for the claims of indirect expropriation.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 214; Reply, \u00b6 148, 149.\n\n250.\n\nIn support of its allegation of indirect expropriation by Venezuela, Claimant further refers to the fact that it \"prevent[ed] the sale of its interest in Petroritupano to a qualified third-party buyer.\"329\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 214.\n\n251.\n\nIt is true that the Venezuelan Minister of Energy and Petroleum did not give his consent to the transfer of the Claimant's shares in Petroritupano to a prospective buyer, the Canadian company PetroFalcon.330 His prior written consent to such transfer was required under Article 6.3 of the Conversion Contract.331 The Claimant, as a party to the Conversion Contract, freely agreed to such a condition for the transfer of shares in Petroritupano. The Minister has no obligation to grant the requested consent, nor to provide any justification for his decision. In any case, the denial by the Minister to consent to the intended transfer of shares does not amount to an act of indirect expropriation. The Claimant has remained the owner of the shares and it is on this basis that it was entitled to receive the declared dividends for 2008 and 2009.\n\nExhibit C-25, Letter from Minister R. Ram\u00edrez to L. Derrota (VUS) (17 September 2008).\n\nExhibit C-2, Conversion Contract.\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it cannot uphold the Claimant's claim that the Respondent indirectly expropriated Claimant's investment in breach of Article 5 of the BIT.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n253.\n\nIn respect of the allocation of costs, the Claimant contends that \"VUS would not have incurred these arbitration costs if Venezuela had complied with its BIT obligations and paid compensation when it was owed. Therefore, in order to place VUS in the same position where it would have been had Venezuela not breached its international obligations, VUS should be awarded all costs, expenses, and attorney's fees incurred herein.\"332 The Claimant adds that \"the Tribunal must also recognize the egregious nature of the underlying conduct in determining the award of costs.\"333\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 265.\n\nClaimant's Amended Costs Submission (1 February 2018), \u00b6 9.\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant claims a total of US$ 3,457,934.59 in legal and expert costs and EUR 425,000.00 in costs of arbitration.334 Of these costs, the Claimant asserts that US$ 843,773.25 were incurred in connection with the Tribunal's considering and ultimate dismissal of the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* ; US$ 2,498,502.98 were incurred in connection with the merits of the dispute; and US$ 115,658.36 were incurred in connection with the unsuccessful challenge by the Respondent to Maitre Fortier and the successful challenge by the Claimant to Dr. Bottini.335\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 18; Claimant's Response on Costs (19 February 2018), \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimant's Amended Costs Submission (1 February 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 20-26; Claimant's Response on Costs (19 February 2018), \u00b6 12.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that all its costs are reasonable in their amounts and have reasonably and necessarily incurred in the prosecution of its claims, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the case, the length of the proceeding, and other circumstances of the case.336 The Claimant, however, notes that, once the costs associated with the Claimant's expert are excluded, the Respondent's legal costs are significantly higher than the Claimant's and have not been properly substantiated.337\n\nClaimant's Amended Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10-12.\n\nClaimant's Response on Costs (19 February 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.\n\n**2. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to order \"Claimant to reimburse Respondent for all reasonable costs and expenses, including legal fees, relating to this Arbitration,\"338 in a total amount of US$ 3,400,000 in legal costs and EUR 425,000.00 in costs of arbitration.339 The Respondent adds that \"there can[not] be any doubt that Respondent's costs are well within the range of reasonableness for cases of this kind.\"340\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 147; Rejoinder, \u00b6 125.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 31 January 2018.\n\nRespondent's e-mail of 20 February 2018.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe decision on costs is reserved for the final award.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n258.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides that:\n\nI. The Tribunal has jurisdiction in the present case;\n\n2. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela breached its obligation under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT by carrying out discriminatory measures impairing the Claimant' s enjoyment of its investment;\n\n3. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is liable to pay compensation to the Claimant for the breach committed in an amount to be determined in the subsequent stage of the proceedings;\n\n4. All other claims are rejected;\n\n5. The decision on costs is reserved for the final stage of the proceedings; and\n\n6.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a dispute between the Claimant and Venezuela arising out of the Claimant's investment in the mixed company Petroritupano S.A. (\"**Petroritupano**\"), submitted to arbitration on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"**Treaty**\"), and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 15 December 1976 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n4.\n\nIn its Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 5 February 2021 (the \"**Partial Award**\"), the Tribunal unanimously decided that, for the reasons set out therein:\n\n1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction in the present case;\n\n2. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela breached its obligation under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT by carrying out discriminatory measures impairing the Claimant's enjoyment of its investment;\n\n3. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is liable to pay compensation to the Claimant for the breach committed in an amount to be determined in the subsequent stage of the proceedings;\n\n4. All other claims are rejected;\n\n5. The decision on costs is reserved for the final stage of the proceedings; and\n\n6. The Tribunal shall issue, after ascertaining the views of the Parties, directions for the further conduct of the proceedings relating to the quantum.\n\n5.\n\nThis Final Award determines the amount of the compensation to be paid by the Respondent as a result of the breach committed.\n\n6.\n\nThe Interim Award on Jurisdiction, issued by the Tribunal on 26 July 2016, and the Partial Award (Jurisdiction and Liability), issued by the Tribunal on 5 February 2021, constitute an integral part of this Final Award.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Partial Award recounts in detail the procedural history of this arbitration from its commencement through the date on which that award was issued. Only the key procedural developments since that date are therefore recorded below.\n\n8.\n\nOn 5 February 2021, the Tribunal issued the Partial Award.\n\n9.\n\nOn 25 February 2021, after having been invited by the Tribunal to confer on the timetable for the proceedings on quantum, the Parties separately advised that they had been unable to reach an agreement and presented their respective proposed timetables to the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nOn 1 March 2021, after having considered the Parties' views and proposals, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, establishing the procedural calendar for the quantum phase leading up to a hearing on 1-2 December 2021.\n\n11.\n\nOn 30 April 2021, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on Quantum (the \"**Memorial**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 29 June 2021, the Parties advised of their agreement to modify the procedural calendar, which was approved by the Tribunal on 30 June 2021. On 13 July 2021, the Parties advised that they had agreed a further modification of the timetable, which was confirmed by the Tribunal on 14 July 2021.\n\n13.\n\nOn 20 July 2021, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Quantum (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn 17 September 2021, the Claimant submitted its Reply on Quantum (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n15.\n\nOn 10 October 2021, the Tribunal, in view of the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and as provided for in paragraph 6 of Procedural Order No. 5, invited the Parties to consult each other and attempt to agree on whether the Hearing on Quantum (the \"**Hearing**\") should be held in person or by videoconference.\n\n16.\n\nBy respective letters of 17 and 18 October 2021, the Claimant and the Respondent advised that they had been unable to reach an agreement on the format of the Hearing and communicated their respective positions on the matter.\n\n17.\n\nOn 19 October 2021, the Claimant communicated, on behalf of the Parties, that they had agreed to re-schedule the pre-hearing conference originally scheduled for 27 October 2021 for the week of 1 November 2021.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 20 October 2021, the Tribunal proposed to take up the question of the format of the Hearing at the pre-hearing conference, which it proposed to hold on 5 November 2021. In addition, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult each other and attempt to agree on the agenda and time allocations during the Hearing.\n\n19.\n\nOn 25 October 2021, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Quantum (the **\"Rejoinder**\").\n\n20.\n\nBy respective e-mails of 1 November 2021, the Parties communicated a joint proposed agenda and time allocations for the Hearing.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 November 2021, the Tribunal, the Parties, and the PCA held a pre-hearing videoconference where the Parties reiterated their positions on the format of the Hearing and expressed their views on other issues that remained to be decided.\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 November 2021, having sought and considered the Parties' views, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, deciding on the organization of the Hearing in a hybrid format, with some participants joining in person in The Hague and others by videoconference.\n\n23.\n\nOn 27 November 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Presiding Arbitrator had tested positive for COVID-19, and asked the Parties to indicate whether they preferred that he participate by videoconference under the circumstances.\n\n24.\n\nOn 27 November 2021, the Claimant advised that it considered that the most prudent option would be to conduct the Hearing in a fully remote format.\n\n25.\n\nOn 28 November 2021, the Respondent objected to holding the Hearing in a fully remote format and requested that the Hearing be postponed in order to allow for the Presiding Arbitrator to recover from his infection and then allow the Hearing to proceed in the planned hybrid format.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 November 2021, the Tribunal advised that it had decided to postpone the Hearing to 11-12 February 2022, unless the Parties agreed to hold the Hearing entirely by videoconference on the originally-scheduled dates.\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 November 2021, the Parties advised that they had been unable to reach an agreement and confirmed their availability for the new proposed dates of 11-12 February 2022.\n\n28.\n\nOn 30 November 2021, the Tribunal confirmed the postponement of the Hearing to the new dates of 11-12 February 2022.\n\n29.\n\nOn 13 January 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, by which Procedural Order No. 6 was replaced and supplemented with those provisions necessary for either a hybrid hearing or, in the alternative, a fully remote videoconference hearing, if so required by the COVID-19 pandemic situation.\n\n30.\n\nOn 1 February 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in view of the worsening COVID-19 situation in the Netherlands, it had decided that the Hearing would take place in a fully remote videoconference format, according to the relevant provisions of Procedural Order No. 7.\n\n31.\n\nOn 11 and 12 February 2022, the Hearing was held by videoconference.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n***a) The Respondent\u2019s breach of the Treaty***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the damages that it seeks flow directly from Venezuela's breach of the Treaty as found in the Partial Award.4 The Claimant notes that, according to the Partial Award, Venezuela breached the Treaty's non-impairment provisions when it gave the discriminatory instruction to pay dividends to Petrobras Energ\u00eda S.A. (\"**Petrobras**\"), while omitting to cause payment to the Claimant.5 According to the Claimant, there are two components of such breach: first, the act whereby Venezuela caused payment of dividends to Petrobras and, second, the omission to cause payment to the Claimant as well.6 The Claimant submits that those two components are inherent in the nature of discriminatory conduct, \"which, by definition, means that similar cases were treated differently without justification.\"7\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 21; Reply, \u00b6 34.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 17; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 9:18-19:2.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.

Therefore, it maintains that the only viable standard for reparation is the payment by Venezuela of the amount that the Claimant would have received in scenario (B): its corresponding portion of the dividends for 2008 and 2009 (US$ 58,870,898.14) plus interest.13 The Claimant contends that this conclusion is consistent with investment treaty jurisprudence on damages for discriminatory acts in violation of international law, citing in particular the decisions in *LG&E v. Argentina* and *Feldman v. Mexico*.14\n\nReply, \u00b6 23; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 22:18-23:16; Exhibit CLA-129, *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*, Judgment, 13 September 1928, PCIJ Series A No. 17, p. 47.\n\nReply, \u00b6 24.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 28, 33; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 23:17-27:18.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 29:24-30:18, 33:22-34:17; Exhibit CLA-41, *LG&E Energy Corp. and others v.

First, the Claimant sustains that this is irrelevant as a matter of law, as full reparation is required under international law.16 Second, the Claimant asserts that the argument is factually inaccurate, as Petroritupano's financial statements show that it had \"more than sufficient funds to pay all the Shareholders the dividends they were owed.\"17 The Claimant further maintains that it is not believable that the only cash available in 2011 just happened to be \"the exact amount down to the dollar of Petrobras's 22 percent share of the total declared dividends.\"18\n\nClaimant's PHB, fn. 1; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 30:19-32:19.\n\nClaimant's PHB, fn. 1; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 32:20-33:10.

The Respondent argues that, in accordance with Article 32 of the Conversion Contract, \"[u]nder no circumstances will distributions be made to shareholders if the Company does not have available cash to pay for them.\"36 The Respondent submits that Petroritupano did not have enough funds to pay dividends to all of Petroritupano's shareholders, and that the Claimant would have received at most US$ 12,951,597.58.37\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 10; citing Hearing Transcript (12 February 2022), 133:19-25, 155:14-25, 156:1-10; Exhibit C-3, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., published in the Official Gazette No. 38.518 on 8 September 2006, Art. 32.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 91-94; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 14-20; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 94:8-97:5.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with recalling its findings in the Partial Award (Jurisdiction and Liability). It found that \"[t]he Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela breached its obligation under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT by carrying out discriminatory measures impairing the Claimant's enjoyment of its investment\" and that \"[t]he Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is liable to pay compensation to the Claimant for the breach committed in an amount to be determined in the subsequent stage of the proceedings.\"38\n\nPartial Award (Jurisdiction and Liability), 5 February 2021, \u00b6 258.\n\n51.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal in the present, and final, stage of the proceeding is thus to determine the amount of compensation to which the Claimant is entitled on account of the breach of its obligation under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT.\n\n52.\n\nThe relevant part of Article 2, paragraph 2, provides that \"[n]either Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\".\n\n53.\n\nIt is true, as emphasized by the Respondent,39 that the non-payment of the dividends declared for 2008 and 2009 by Petroritupano to the Claimant, was not, in the Tribunal's analysis, attributable to Venezuela.40 It is to be noted that the declared dividends were neither paid, within the required period of five days following the date of declaration of approval of dividends by the Shareholders' Meeting,41 to another foreign investor, namely Petrobras.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; Rejoinder, \u00b6 10; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 5.\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 207.\n\nSee Exhibit C-3, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., published in the Official Gazette No. 38.518 on 8 September 2006, Art. 32.\n\n54.\n\nHowever, it has been established by the Claimant before the Tribunal that Petrobras was later, in 2011, paid the dividends in full \"shortly before the visit of the Venezuelan President to Brazil to discuss, among other things, cooperation in energy matters\".42 The Tribunal considered that \"[t]he Government of Venezuela, no doubt, was in a position to make that instruction [that the payment of the declared dividends be made to Petrobras], as Petroritupano is controlled by CVP, which in turn is controlled by PDVSA wholly-owned by the State\".43 Recalling that PDVSA's Chairman at the relevant time was the Minister of Energy and Petroleum, the Tribunal was of the view that there was a presumption that the payment was made under the instruction of the Government of Venezuela. While the Respondent was in a position to request explanations from PDVSA and CVP for the payment of the dividends made to Petrobras in 2011, it, however, did not provide any explanation. In view of the above, the Tribunal concluded that it was \"convinced that the payment of the dividends to Petrobras was made on the instructions of the Government of Venezuela\".44\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 222.\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 222.\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 222.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Government of Venezuela was entitled to pursue its policy of developing cooperation in energy matters with Brazil when it considered it important to arrange for the payment of the declared dividends to Petrobras, on the eve of the visit of the President of Venezuela to Brazil.45 It could have done so while, however, respecting its international legal obligation, set out in Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT prohibiting discriminatory treatment of Barbadian companies. The Claimant, a company incorporated in Barbados, was in the same situation as Petrobras, and both did not receive the declared dividends from Petroritupano within the prescribed time. The non-discrimination obligation required the Government of Venezuela, once it decided for policy reasons to arrange in 2011 for the payment of the dividends to Petrobras, to arrange for the payment of the dividends also to the Claimant. In this way, while pursuing its energy policy objectives, the Respondent would have complied with its obligation under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the BIT. Had the Respondent proceeded in this way, and thus complied with its obligation of non-discrimination, the Claimant would have been treated in the same way as Petrobras, and consequently would have received the declared dividends in the amount of US$ 58,870,898.14 in the same period as Petrobras, i.e., in late May 2011.\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 220.\n\n56.\n\nThe arrangement by the Government of Venezuela for the payment of the dividends to Petrobras in 2011 cannot be undone. To remedy the consequences for the Claimant of the discriminatory treatment against it by the Respondent, it is necessary, in the view of the Tribunal, to order the Respondent to pay the Claimant US$ 58,870,898.14 which shall be paid within two months from the date of this Final Award, unless this amount has been paid in that period by Petroritupano or CVP.\n\n**B.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is entitled to pre-award interest from the date of the Respondent's breach. According to the Claimant, full reparation requires that \"interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid.\"46 According to the Claimant, this means that interest should run from when it should have received its portion of the 2008 and 2009 dividends in May 2011, at the same time as Petrobras received its dividends.47\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 25; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 34:18-39:2; Exhibit RLA-317, Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, U.N.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant is not entitled to any interest prior to the rendering of the final award. First, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's calculation of interest, because it is based on the fact that its dividends were \"trapped\" in Petroritupano, something which, the Respondent reiterates, is not attributable to Venezuela.51 Second, the Respondent notes that \"[t]here is no uniform approach, internationally, to questions of quantification and assessment of amounts of interest payable. In practice, the circumstances of each case and the conduct of the parties strongly affect the outcome.\"52 Third, the Respondent cites various arbitral tribunals that have rejected pre-award interest on the basis that interest cannot be calculated until the actual amount of damages is established in a final award, and even until the expiry of a grace period of at least 60 days thereafter.53\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 98:20-101:2.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 63; Rejoinder, \u00b6 105; Exhibit RLA-317, Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, U.N.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n62.\n\nHad the Respondent not breached its obligation of non-discrimination, while pursuing its legitimate energy policy objectives, the Claimant would have received by the end of May 2011, on the same date as Petrobras, the amount of US$ 58,870,898.14. In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimant is entitled to receive interest from the moment the Respondent breached its obligation of non-discrimination. Under Article 38, paragraph 2, of the ILC Articles, which both Parties have cited in their submissions,59 \"[i]nterest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\"60 The interest on the principal amount due will provide the Claimant with the full reparation of the injury caused by the Respondent's breach. It remains for the Tribunal to determine the appropriate interest rate to which it turns next.\n\nReply, \u00b6 39; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 63.\n\nExhibit RLA-317, Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, U.N.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n***a) Interest rate equivalent to Petroritupano's cost of equity***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the pre-award and post-award interest rates62 should be equivalent to Petroritupano's cost of equity of 11.83%.63 The Claimant sustains that the loss that it suffered as a result of Venezuela's breach is \"the opportunity cost of having been deprived of the funds in question, and instead having been forced to reinvest those funds into Petroritupano.\"64 Thus, the Claimant argues that the interest rate should be equivalent to the return that the Claimant would have demanded and received to compensate it for the risks of an equity investment in Petroritupano, which, according to the Claimant, is Petroritupano's cost of equity.65\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]here is no reason to differentiate between the rate applicable to delayed payment damages accruing prior to or after the Award.\" See Memorial, \u00b6 44; Reply, \u00b6 75.\n\nReply, \u00b6 60; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 45:17-46:2; Exhibit CER-4, Fourth Kaczmarek Report, 17 September 2021, \u00b6 106-110 and Table 7.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 28; Exhibit CLA-170, T.

The Claimant submits that, as an unwilling lender to Venezuela, Venezuela US should be compensated no less than any willing lender to Venezuela.80 The Claimant notes that Venezuela's borrowing rate as of May 2011 was approximately 13.42%.81 The Claimant maintains that this rate \"is consistent with, and indeed higher than, the cost of equity sought by the Claimant as its primary argument, confirming the reasonableness of the Claimant's primary case on interest.\"82 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that, if the Claimant were in the same position as a willing lender to Venezuela, the Claimant would have suffered from the destruction in the value of Venezuela's sovereign debt that has actually occurred in the real world.83 The Claimant sustains that \"Venezuela misses the point of comparison\", as the question is not what return the Claimant would have achieved, but rather the interest rate that Venezuela must pay in order to convince investors to lend to it.84\n\nSee generally Memorial, Section IV.C; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21; Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 47:24-48:19.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 43.\n\nReply, \u00b6 68.\n\nReply, \u00b6 67; referring to Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 110-115.\n\nReply, \u00b6 67.\n\n70.\n\nAs yet a further alternative but \"far less justified economically\" rate, the Claimant's expert proposes the interest rate established in the Hydrocarbons Purchase and Sales Contract for any delay by PDVSA in paying Petroritupano for hydrocarbons it purchased, i.e., LIBOR + 4%.85 The Claimant's expert maintains that this rate is less reliable because \"PdVSA never honored this aspect of the Hydrocarbons Purchase and Sales Contract.

The Respondent defends that there are no grounds to assume that a shareholder would borrow at an interest rate that is higher than the return they expect to obtain from an investment in Petroritupano.105 In any event, the Respondent claims that the cost of equity and the LIBOR + 10% estimated by Mr. Kaczmarek are not comparable, as the cost of equity is variable over time and the Claimant has only provided estimates for 2011 and 2014.106 Finally, the Respondent maintains that the Conversion Contract refers to a rate equal to 1-month LIBOR + 10%, and not a 12-month LIBOR, which is, \"on average, approximately 3 times higher than the 1-month LIBOR provided for in the Conversion Contract.\"107\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 102.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 102; referring to Exhibit RER-1, Bello Report, 20 July 2021, \u00b6 81.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that interest must be compensatory, not punitive.116 International law does not accept the concept of punitive interests.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 90.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the various alternative interest rates suggested by the Claimant. When determining which one would be the most appropriate, the Tribunal must keep in mind that Venezuela, while having breached its obligation of non-discrimination, has not benefited from the amounts of unpaid dividends to the Claimant. It has also to be recalled that, in its Partial Award, the Tribunal concluded that the acts of Petroritupano were not attributable to the Respondent.117 For these reasons the Tribunal does not consider it justified to accept the principal suggestion of the Claimant that the pre-award interest rate should be equivalent to Petroritupano's cost of equity of 11.83%.118\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 207.\n\nReply, \u00b6 49, Hearing Transcript (11 February 2022), 41:23.\n\n82.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal does not consider that the interest rate LIBOR + 10% set in Article 1.6 of the Conversion Contract for shareholder's failure to pay required contributions, an alternative suggested by the Claimant, would be appropriate.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that it should apply an interest rate equivalent to the yield on Venezuela's sovereign debt, another alternative suggested by the Claimant. The Tribunal takes into account the nature of the breach committed by the Respondent, discriminatory treatment by failing to arrange for the payment of the declared dividends to the Claimant. The Respondent did not benefit personally from the unpaid amounts.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent's view that, if any, \"short-term risk-free rate should be applicable to any award on interest in this case\".119 Referring to its Expert Witness, the Respondent opines that the Claimant's Expert should have used a short-term risk-free rate, namely the rate of return on 1-year U.S. Treasury bills.120 This view is based on the consideration that an award is a risk-free asset. The Respondent has, however, not shown that, in view of its past practice, this Award will be promptly complied with and not involve any element of risk. Moreover, the Tribunal has no reason to assume that the Claimant, had it been paid the principal amount in late May 2011, would have used this amount for the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills. For the above reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that a short-term risk-free interest is not appropriate in the circumstances of the present case.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 26; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 75, 91.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 81.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimant's Expert Witness suggested another alternative, the interest rate agreed in the Hydrocarbons Purchase and Sales Contract for any delay by PDVSA in paying Petroritupano for the delivered hydrocarbons, which was an annual rate equal to LIBOR + 4 percent.121 The Tribunal believes that this is the best from the various options suggested by the Parties and their Expert Witnesses. It reflects economic and commercial realities prevailing in Venezuela in the oil sector in the period it was agreed on. Although the Contract was not concluded between Venezuela and the Claimant, both were aware of its content, Venezuela as being the sole shareholder of PDVSA and the Claimant as one of the three shareholders of Petroritupano.\n\nExhibit CER-3, Third Kaczmarek Report, 30 April 2021, \u00b6 23; Exhibit C-2(K), Conversion Contract, Annex, K, Proyecto de Contrato de Compraventa de Hidrocarburos entre Petroritupano, S.A. y PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo, S.A., June 2006, Clause 7.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant's Expert calculated the amount due as interest running from 31 May 2011 until 31 December 2021 to be US$ 41,955,408 in total.122 The Respondent, while arguing against the adoption of this interest rate, has not taken issue with the calculations. Applying the same methodology up to the date of this Final Award produces a total amount of pre-award interest of US$ 46,624,436.\n\nExhibit CER-4, Fourth Kaczmarek Report, 17 September 2021, Table \u00b6 10.\n\n**D. C****ompound** **I****nterest**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant submits that both pre- and post-award interest should be compounded annually.123 The Claimant contends that (i) \"tribunals have consistently affirmed that compound interest best gives effect to the customary international law rule of full reparation\";124 (ii) the most recent practice of tribunals is to provide for compound interest;125 and (iii) these conclusions also accord with economic reality.126 The Claimant adds that Judge Crawford's comments on Article 38 of the ILC Articles, on which the Respondent relies, as well as the \"few outlier cases which themselves rely upon those older remarks\" are outdated.127 The Claimant notes that Judge Crawford himself has recognized in more recent statements that \"[s]ince 2001, compound interest has been awarded increasingly, particularly in investment arbitration.\"128\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 45, 50; Reply, \u00b6 72.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 45; referring to Exhibit CLA-181, *SAUR International S.A. v.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that any interest rate that the Tribunal deems to be applicable in this case must be assessed as simple interest.130 The Respondent asserts that there is no automatic right to compound interest but, rather, that the Claimant has the burden of proving that there are specific grounds that justify its application, which it has not done in the present case.131\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 110; Rejoinder, \u00b6 161.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163.\n\n90.\n\nIn support of its argument, the Respondent cites Professor Crawford's Commentary to Article 38 of the ILC Articles, as well as various investment treaty decisions.132 The Respondent also refers to the *Costa Rica v. Nicaragua* judgment of the International Court of Justice, as well as the decisions in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* and *Micula v. Romania*, which were relied upon by the Claimant with regard to other issues.133 The Respondent further cites cases that relied on the respondent's State domestic laws to find against compound interest.134 The Respondent denies that these holdings are limited to contract-based cases with application of local law, as alleged by the Claimant.135\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 111-113; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 164, 169-171; Exhibit RLA-358, James Crawford, The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 237-238; Exhibit RLA-357, *Mr. Franck Charles Arif v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that awarding a simple interest would not fully compensate the Claimant. Had the Claimant received the payment in late May 2011, the received funds would likely have been used by the Claimant for generating further profits. Even if the funds had simply been deposited in a bank account generating interest, that interest would have been compounded. The Tribunal finds that, taking into account the prevailing economic realities, it is appropriate to award interest to be compounded on a yearly basis.\n\n**VII. TAXES**\n--------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant notes that it has already met its Venezuelan tax obligations on its share of Petroritupano's profits, \"because the dividends were declared after all tax obligations had been satisfied\", as required by Petroritupano's Articles of Incorporation.137 For this reason, as well as \"to ensure the finality of the Tribunal's Award, secure full reparation, and prevent double taxation, the Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal declare in the Award that: (*i*) the Award amount is net of all Venezuelan taxes; and (*ii*) Venezuela shall not tax or attempt to tax the Award.\"138\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 51; referring to Exhibit C-3, Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Mixed Company Petroritupano, S.A., published in the Official Gazette No. 38.518 on 8 September 2006, Art. 32; Exhibit C-73, Petroritupano, S.A.

COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**1. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n***a) Allocation of costs***\n----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant submits that: \"(i) under the UNCITRAL Rules and general arbitral practice, costs should follow the event and be awarded to the prevailing party; (ii) the Claimant is the prevailing party in this arbitration, having established that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Venezuela, established that Venezuela breached the Treaty, defeated Venezuela's baseless challenge to Mr. Fortier, and succeeded in its challenge to Venezuela's first appointed arbitrator; and (iii) only an award of indemnity costs will achieve full reparation.\"139\n\nReply, \u00b6 77.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThis arbitral proceeding is conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 40 thereof provides in the relevant parts:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. These costs include (i) the fees of the arbitral tribunal; (ii) the travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators; (iii) fees and expenses of the appointing authority; and (iv) fees and expenses of the PCA which has acted as the Registry.\n\n103.\n\nThe Parties each made deposits to cover the abovementioned costs of the arbitration in the amount of EUR 525,000.00. The costs of arbitration covered from such deposits, taking into account the Terms of Appointment agreed upon by the Parties, the Tribunal, and the PCA, are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TRIBUNAL** | **EUR 615,625.00** |\n| H.E. Judge Peter Tomka | EUR 294,125.00 |\n| The Honourable L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC | EUR 125,000.00 |\n| Professor Marcelo Kohen | EUR 141,500.00 |\n| Mr. G. Bottini | EUR 55,000.00 |\n| **PCA** | **EUR 123,500.00** |\n| **OTHER EXPENSES** (including court reporting, hearing facilities, interpretation, translation, travel, etc.) | **EUR 139,527.10** |\n| **TOTAL** | **EUR 878,652.10** |\n\n104.\n\nFollowing the issuance of this Final Award, the PCA shall return the unexpended balance to the Parties in equal shares.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Parties' costs for legal representation and assistance reflected above are comparable, there being only a minor difference between them. Therefore, under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal determines that they are reasonable.\n\n106.\n\nAs regards the allocation and apportionment of costs, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has prevailed in this proceeding, even if the Tribunal has rejected a number of the Claimant's claims.145 The Tribunal further recalls that while the Claimant's challenge of an arbitrator was successful, the appointing authority rejected the Respondent's challenge of another arbitrator. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant is the successful party, and the Respondent the unsuccessful party, in accordance with Articles 38(e) and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Taking these circumstances into account, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to apportion the costs of arbitration between the Parties. The Respondent shall therefore bear 70% of the costs of arbitration borne from the deposit held by the PCA, and the Claimant the remaining 30% of these costs. The Respondent shall also reimburse 70% of the costs incurred by the Claimant for legal representation and assistance.\n\nPartial Award, \u00b6 258(4). The Tribunal rejected the claims concerning fair and equitable treatment, expropriation, and umbrella clause.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n107.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n1. The Respondent, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, shall pay compensation to the Claimant, Venezuela US, S.R.L, in the amount of US$ 58,870,898;\n\n2. The Respondent shall pay to the Claimant interest on the amount awarded under sub-paragraph 1 above, accrued between 31 May 2011 and the date of this Final Award, in the amount of US$ 46,624,436;\n\n3. The Respondent shall pay to the Claimant interest on the amounts awarded under sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 above, from the date of this Final Award until the date of full payment of these amounts, at the rate of twelve-month USD LIBOR plus a margin of four percent (4%) with annual compounding of the accrued interest;\n\n4. Should, for any reason, twelve-month USD LIBOR cease to be operative while any amount remains outstanding under sub-paragraphs 1 to 3 above, the interest due shall be calculated from that date onward on the basis of whatever rate is generally considered equivalent to twelve-month USD LIBOR plus a margin of four percent (4%) with annual compounding;\n\n5. If, within two months following the date of this Final Award, the Claimant is paid by Petroritupano or CVP the amounts due under sub-paragraphs 1 to 4 above, the Claimant shall be prevented from seeking enforcement of these amounts;\n\n6. Upon compliance by the Respondent with this Final Award, the Claimant shall be precluded from requesting from Petroritupano or CVP the payment of the amounts determined in sub-paragraphs 1 to 4 above;\n\n7. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant EUR 615,056.47 for the costs of this arbitration borne from the deposit held by the PCA and US$ 3,215,534.99 for the costs of legal representation and assistance incurred by the Claimant, plus simple interest at a rate of six percent (6%), from the day one month following the date of this Final Award until the date of full payment of these amounts;\n\n8. All the above payments to the Claimant by the Respondent shall be free of any taxation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; and\n\n9. All other claims by the Parties are rejected.\n\n**Date:** 4 November 2022\n\n**Place of arbitration: The Hague**\n\n[108].\n\nArbitrator Professor Marcelo Kohen makes the following declaration:\n\n\"Without prejudice to my positions taken in the two prior Partial Awards, I subscribe to the decision of the Tribunal on quantum because I consider that the solution chosen is one among those that are possible under the circumstances of the case and in line with its precedent awards. Indeed, contrary to aspects of jurisdiction or the merits, in matters of reparation the Tribunal disposes of some margin of discretion in order to decide which are the consequences arising from the commission of an internationally wrongful act.\""}]}
