In a letter of the same date, the Claimant, Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) (\"SCB HK\"), indicated that it was opposed to bifurcation, as the jurisdictional questions and the merits questions, all rooted in contractual undertakings, would involve consideration of the same documents during the two phases. In the Minutes of its First Session held on July 7, 2011, the Tribunal decided that it was not in a position to decide on the question of bifurcation at that time, and invited the Parties to confer and revert with a schedule that contemplated two possible scenarios, bifurcation and non-bifurcation.1 In light of this, a timetable was agreed under which if the Respondent wished to request bifurcation it would do so by April 13, 2012. If it did request bifurcation, the Claimant could file its Opposition by May 2, 2012 and the Respondent a Reply by May 9, 2012. A hearing on bifurcation would then be held on May 14, 2012.\n\nMinutes of the First Session, para. 14.\n\n2.\n\nOn April 13, 2012, the Respondent filed an application for bifurcation (\"Application\"). On May 2, 2012, the Claimant filed its Opposition to bifurcation (\"Opposition\") and on May 9, 2012, the Respondent filed its Reply (\"Reply\"). In accordance with the agreed timetable, a hearing on the question of bifurcation was held in London on May 14, 2012 in the presence of the Tribunal and the Parties' counsel.\n\n**II The Arguments of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nIn its letter of July 6, 2012, the Respondent had listed the following five objections to jurisdiction:\n\n\u2022 First, the restructured Term Loans 1 and 2 that SCB HK claimed to acquire in 2005 from Danaharta and which are the basis for its claims in this arbitration, were not the valid debt of IPTL.\n\n\u2022 Second, Danaharta and SCB HK were also aware that the restructuring (including altering the waterfall of payments under the 1977 Facility Loan) was a violation of the Power Purchase Agreement (\"PPA\") and the incorporated financial model.\n\n\u2022 Third, SCB HK knew or was on notice that the 1977 Facility Loan and related facility documents, including the Mortgage Deed, the Security Deed and Charge of Shares, were never properly registered in Tanzania.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, as acknowledged by Danaharta's solicitors, whatever rights SCB HK claimed to acquire would be void if the winding up order is made as the restructured loan it acquired was finalized after the winding up suit was filed.\n\n\u2022 Fifth, because the provisional liquidator assumed control over the assets of Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\") in 2008 (before SCB HK claims it was even appointed as Security Agent) the provisional liquidator has superior standing to SCB HK with respect to IPTL and its assets.\n\n4.\n\nIn its application for bifurcation, however, the Respondent asserted only a single challenge to jurisdiction, based on the third and fifth objections in its July 6, 2011 letter. The subject of the challenge, the Respondent claimed, is entirely separate from the merits.2 According to the Respondent, SCB HK's claim is based on its acquisition of a security interest in the PPA between IPTL and TANESCO, but that security interest has never been registered in accordance with Tanzanian law. Thus, SCB HK\u2019s security interest is void against the liquidator appointed by the Tanzanian courts in the winding up of IPTL. As a result, SCB HK has no standing to bring this claim. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the matter is a straightforward question of Tanzanian law.\n\nApplication, para. 2.\n\n5.\n\nOn the basis of expert testimony, the Respondent argued that the security interest, which SCB HK claimed it had acquired by assignment from IPTL, was a \"charge on book debts\" or alternatively a floating charge within the meaning of the Tanzanian Companies Ordinance. Since that security interest was never registered against IPTL\u2019s assets, it was void against the liquidator for IPTL.3\n\nReply, paras 8-11.\n\n6.\n\nIn TANESCO\u2019s view, bifurcation would result in \"procedural economy\" since in order to decide the jurisdictional claim, the Tribunal would not have to sift through thousands of pages of exhibits, and it would avoid the preparation of witness statements and expert testimony on accounting and financial modeling in order to address the \"invoice dispute\".4 The Respondent also argued that in order to consider the \"invoice dispute\", it would also be necessary to \"rehash\" the testimony, exhibits and briefs in the first ICSID arbitration between IPTL and TANESCO.5 By contrast, the Respondent argued, the jurisdictional issue it had raised presented a \"narrow issue of law\" relating to the standing of SCB HK to pursue these claims.6\n\nApplication, paras 5 and 6.\n\nApplication, para. 6\n\nApplication, para. 8.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Opposition to Bifurcation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant argued, in opposition to the request for bifurcation, that its claim in the present case rests not on a charge over book debts or a floating charge, but rather on the separate assignment under the Security Deed of the PPA to the Security Agent, which is now SCB HK.7 This assignment, the Claimant argued, does not constitute a charge over book debts or a floating charge.\n\nOpposition, para. 11.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant further argued that the merits are not as complicated as the Respondent claims and in any event in order to decide the jurisdictional issue the Tribunal will have to consider the same documents and issues relevant to the dispute on the merits.8 In the view of the Claimant, the jurisdictional and merits issues can be heard together in accordance with the combined timetable and that this will prevent further delay in hearing the merits issues.\n\nOpposition, paras 16 and 17.\n\n**III Analysis**\n----------------\n\n9.\n\nIn considering this matter, the Tribunal took account of three issues:\n\n\u2022 First, was the objection being asserted a matter of jurisdiction, or did it really go to the merits of the case?\n\n\u2022 Second, was the matter discrete and separable from the merits of the dispute?\n\n\u2022 Third, would bifurcation be likely to promote \"procedural economy\", resulting in savings in time, effort and expense?\n\n**1. Jurisdiction or Merits**\n-----------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn the oral hearing, the Tribunal questioned the Respondent about the nature of the preliminary objection it was asserting. The Respondent confirmed that it was not challenging the validity of the assignment of the arbitration clause in the PPA to the Claimant in accordance with the Security Deed. It is this arbitration clause that is invoked by the Claimant as the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case. The Respondent thus conceded that its preliminary objection was not of a jurisdictional nature. The essence of the Respondent\u2019s objection was instead that the failure to register the charge on book debts and the floating charge under the Security Deed rendered any security interest void against the Liquidator of IPTL.9 The Respondent took the view that this objection could be characterized as pertaining to the standing of the Claimant and on that basis could be considered as a matter relating to the \"competence\" of the Tribunal10 such that it could be raised under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.11\n\nTranscript, pages 13ff.\n\nTranscript, pages 16-17.\n\nTranscript, page 107.\n\n11.\n\nIn any event, both Parties took the view that even if this were not a jurisdictional matter under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the power of the Tribunal under Article 44 to manage the case would include a power to separate out this issue and treat it as a preliminary issue separate from the merits.12 In light of the Parties' agreement on the power of the Tribunal under Article 44 to bifurcate in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal has decided not to consider the issue of the applicability of Article 41 any further.\n\nTranscript, pages 106-107.\n\n**2. The Discrete Nature of the Issue**\n---------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent had argued that its preliminary objection gives rise to a discrete and straightforward issue that could be decided largely on the basis of Tanzanian law without consideration of the broader factual matrix of the dispute and the Respondent's substantive defences on the merits. The Claimant argued that the matter raised by the Respondent as a preliminary objection was more complicated than the Respondent represented because it was connected with the broader issue of what was actually assigned to the Claimant under the Security Deed. This, according to the Claimant, would require an analysis of the same documents and evidence that were relevant to the merits. Further, the Claimant argued that the substance of its claim - which it labeled the \"invoice dispute\"- was not as complicated as had been portrayed by the Respondent.\n\n12.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent gives rise to issues of contractual interpretation in respect of the Security Deed as well as questions relating to the perfection of security interests under Tanzanian law. There is no doubt that this would involve some analysis of other documentation in the case relating to the merits. Nevertheless, the objection raised by the Respondent is sufficiently discrete that it could in principle be separated from the merits.\n\n**3. The Procedural Economy of Bifurcation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent argued that there would be \"procedural economy\" in bifurcation. In its view,\n\n\"The Tribunal should in the interests of efficiency and cost savings, bifurcate this proceeding to first determine whether SCB HK has standing. In the likely event that the Tribunal finds that SCB HK does not have standing, the arbitration will be dismissed, and a substantial burden on both the Parties and the Tribunal will be lifted\".13\n\nIn short, the Respondent was weighing the likelihood of success at the preliminary phase against the cost of proceeding to the merits phase.\n\nApplication, para. 8.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant by contrast doubted the cost savings of bifurcation in part because the same issues and evidence would have to be considered at both the preliminary and merits phases, and in part because the basis of Respondent\u2019s objection was not properly characterized as one of jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nIn short, the question for the Tribunal was whether, even if the Respondent were to be successful in its objection relating to the lack of registration of the Claimant\u2019s security interest, this would dispose of the entire case. If not, then the claims to cost savings and procedural economy would appear less compelling.\n\n16.\n\nIn its Application, the Respondent asserted that the effect of the failure of SCB HK to register its security interest meant that it was \"void against the liquidator\".14 In its Reply, the Respondent referred to the expert opinion of Professor Luitfried Xavier Mbunda that under Tanzanian law the effect of non-registration of the security interest was that SCB HK\u2019s interest was \"void against IPTL\u2019s liquidators and creditors\".15\n\nApplication, para. 3.\n\nReply, para. 11 and Statement of Prof. Mbunda, para. 14 (Appendix D to the Reply).\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant argued, however, that the security interest created under Section 3.1 of the Security Deed was separate from the assignment of the PPA to the Security Agent under Section 3.2 of the Security Deed. The right to arbitrate arose under that assignment and was independent of the security interest established under Section 3.1. It was the assignment under Section 3.2 on which the Claimant argued that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal rested.\n\n18.\n\nIn seeking to explain to the Tribunal how failure to register the security interest could affect SCB HK\u2019s *in personam* right to pursue a claim against TANESCO, the Respondent argued that if SCB HK lost its security interest, through failure to register it, \"then the asset belongs to IPTL under the control of the liquidator, and our view is they can't really proceed with this arbitration. Only the liquidator could proceed with this arbitration\".16 According to the Claimant, however, the failure to register has an impact on the priority of a claim against the liquidator, but this affects only what can be done with any monies recovered in this arbitration; it does not affect the right to bring a claim. Under this view, the Claimant can bring this claim, but it might be only an unsecured creditor in respect of access to the monies that would result from any award in its favor.17\n\nTranscript, page 109, lines 6-9.\n\nTranscript, pages 91-94.\n\n19.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Respondent had the burden of establishing the likelihood of \"procedural economy\" and this included establishing that its preliminary objection would, if successful, dispose of the claims advanced by the Claimant in their entirety. In the event, the Tribunal is not convinced that even if the Respondent were to be successful in its basic contention that the failure of SCB UK to register its security interest rendered it void against the liquidator that this would in fact dispose of the case.\n\n20.\n\nWhile the Respondent does not contend that the Claimant was required to register the assignment of the interest in the PPA to the Security Agent under Section 3.2 of the Security Deed, it appears to argue that the effect of non-registration of an interest under 3.1 of the Security Deed nullifies the right to pursue an *in personam* claim by SCB HK against TANESCO - a right that had been assigned to it under Section 3.2 of the Security Deed. Yet the argument that the right to sue is in the sole hands of the liquidator did not appear to be supported in the communication of the liquidator to SCB HK of May 8, 2012, which was placed before the Tribunal at the May 14 hearing with the consent of both Parties. The liquidator had been given the opportunity to assert that SCB HK could not pursue these claims because they were within his sole province, but he refrained from making such an assertion.\n\n21.\n\nIn addition, the claim made in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial is not just to order payment of the sums of money allegedly owed to IPTL by TANESCO, it also involves a declaration that TANESCO was in breach of its contract with IPTL and a declaration that moneys are owing to IPTL. It is not clear to the Tribunal how the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection to the effect that the Claimant failed to register its security interest would affect the right to request those declarations.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal has not, for the purposes of this decision on bifurcation, come to a definitive view as to whether the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection, if upheld, would have the effect of disposing of the entire case. The Tribunal has simply resolved that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of establishing that the separate adjudication of its preliminary objection would achieve the efficiency and cost savings that the Respondent claims.\n\n23.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not consider that the case for bifurcation of the present dispute has been made out by the Respondent.\n\n24.\n\nIn the course of the May 14, 2012 hearing, the Claimant introduced 52 documents, which it had provided to the Respondent the previous evening. The Respondent challenged the production of a number of these documents and subsequently confirmed that challenge in writing by letter of May 21, 2012. The Claimant responded by letter of May 28, 2012. At the present stage, the Tribunal observes that it did not rely on any of the documents challenged in reaching its decision on the issue of bifurcation. It will rule on the Respondent\u2019s challenge to the production of those documents when it rules on the Parties\u2019 motions to compel the production of documents (Claimant\u2019s Motion of May 2, 2012; Respondent\u2019s Motion of May 9, 2012) that were the subject of separate submissions at the May 14, 2012 hearing.\n\n**IV Order**\n------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s application to bifurcate the proceedings and directs that the proceedings continue in accordance with Track B set out in the Minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal dated July 13, 2012."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2014-02-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\n--------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms** |\n| Addendum No. 1 | Addendum No. 1 to the PPA dated June 9, 1995 (Exh.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated March 18, 1965 (the \"ICSID Convention\"), arising out of a Power Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 1995 (the \"PPA\"), entered into by Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (\"TANESCO\"), the Respondent in this proceeding, and Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (\"SCB HK\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong with its principal place of business in 32nd Floor, Standard Chartered Bank Building, 4-4a Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong. It is a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank (\"SCB\"), which is incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Claimant brings its claim in this arbitration in its capacity as assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights and is claiming various payments owed to IPTL by TANESCO which allegedly remain outstanding.1 The claim is brought on the basis of the arbitration clause contained in the PPA which refers to ICSID arbitration.\n\nRfA, para. 2.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent, the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (\"TANESCO\" or the \"Respondent\"), is an entity wholly owned by the United Republic of Tanzania (\"Tanzania\" or the \"GoT\") and designated as an agency of Tanzania pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. TANESCO\u2019s address is P.O. Box 9024, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Oversight of TANESCO is through the Ministry of Energy and Minerals.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above.\n\n**II. Procedural History**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn September 15, 2010, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date (the \"Request\" or \"RfA\") from SCB HK against TANESCO.\n\n6.\n\nOn October 1, 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID sent the Parties a Notice of Registration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. In issuing the Notice, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and pursuant to the following method:\n\ni. The Tribunal was to be made up of 3 arbitrators, one appointed by each of the Parties and the third, the President, to be agreed between the two party-appointed arbitrators;\n\nii. SCB HK was to appoint an arbitrator and notify ICSID and the Respondent of its appointment by November 8, 2010;\n\niii. Respondent was to appoint an arbitrator and notify ICSID and the Claimant of its appointment by January 7, 2011;\n\niv. Each of the Claimant and the Respondent was to provide their appointee and each other with the names of 3 possible candidates as President of the Tribunal no later than January 14, 2011;\n\nv. Following the provision of the lists of possible candidates, the two party-appointed arbitrators were to confer in order to appoint the third arbitrator, who would act as President of the Tribunal, from the lists provided by the Parties;\n\nvi. The Parties had also agreed on a default method of appointment in the event that the two co-arbitrators could not find an agreement.\n\n8.\n\nSCB HK appointed Professor Zachary Douglas, a national of Australia, who accepted his appointment on November 12, 2010. TANESCO appointed Professor Brigitte Stem, a national of France, who accepted her appointment on January 10, 2011. Professor Douglas and Professor Stem further appointed Professor Donald McRae, a national of Canada and New Zealand, as President of the Tribunal, who accepted his appointment on April 18, 2011. The Tribunal was constituted on April 19, 2011. Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. First session of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first session with the Parties in London, England, on July 7, 2011. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English and that the place of any hearings would be London, England.\n\n**D. Parties\u2019 submissions and hearing on jurisdiction and the merits**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent indicated that it wished to bifurcate the proceedings. Given that the Tribunal was not in a position to decide on bifurcation at the first session, a schedule was put in place for the production of documents and the submissions of the first round of pleadings. The Claimant filed its Memorial on February 3, 2012 (\"Cl. Mem.\"), and the Respondent filed a Memorial on jurisdiction on April 13, 2012, together with a request to bifurcate and address its objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal held a hearing in London on May 14, 2012, on the issue of bifurcation and also heard the Parties on issues of production of documents. On May 29, 2012, in Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation, in the following terms:\n\nThe Tribunal has not, for the purposes of this decision on bifurcation, come to a definitive view as to whether the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection, if upheld, would have the effect of disposing of the entire case. The Tribunal has simply resolved that the Respondent has not discharged its burden of establishing that the separate adjudication of its preliminary objection would achieve the efficiency and cost savings that the Respondent claims.\n\n12.\n\nThe schedule for the filing of written submissions was modified upon the Parties\u2019 requests through various procedural orders that the Tribunal need not recall in detail here.2 On August 24, 2012, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction and the merits (\"Resp. CM\"). On November 7, 2012, the Claimant filed a Reply on jurisdiction and the merits (\"Cl. Rep.\"). On November 21, 2012, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on jurisdiction and the merits (\"Resp. Rej.\").\n\nProcedural Order No. 7 dated July 11, 2012 to Procedural Order No. 10 dated November 20, 2012.\n\n13.\n\nThroughout this process, the Tribunal issued two procedural orders concerning the production of documents on November 14, 2011, and July 6, 2012, respectively.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that ICSID received correspondence from third parties, as will be mentioned below, which was transmitted to the Parties and the Members of the Tribunal. The Parties informed the Centre and the Tribunal on September 13, 2012, that they had agreed that unsolicited communications from third parties were to be first sent to the Parties for consultation as to whether such communications should be forwarded to the Tribunal and that either Party could, at any time, request the Secretariat to forward the document to the Tribunal. On August 16, 2013, the Parties further informed the Centre that in the absence of any such request from either Party, the Centre should assume that the Parties were content for documents/correspondence from third parties not to be provided to the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place at the IDRC in London from December 3 to 6, 2012, and from December 10 to 11, 2012 (the \"December hearing\").

Overview of the Case and of the Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it useful to provide first an overview of this case, which involves complex facts, multiple proceedings and multiple participants. The Tribunal has been charged with the daunting task of settling a dispute that traces back to 1998 and which has already generated two ICSID arbitration proceedings and an interpretation proceeding as well as an LCIA arbitration and multiple domestic proceedings in Tanzania and Malaysia.\n\n22.\n\nAs it will be explained in more detail below, in 1995 TANESCO and IPTL entered into the Power Purchase Agreement (the \"PPA\")3 whereby IPTL agreed to design, construct, own, operate and maintain an electricity generating facility in Tanzania. This case arises out of the alleged non-payment by TANESCO of various payments due to IPTL under the PPA.\n\nExh. C-4/R-1.\n\n23.\n\nAn original dispute in 1998 between TANESCO and IPTL was settled by an ICSID tribunal in the case of *TANESCO v. IPTL,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/8, which rendered an award on July 12, 2001 (the \"ICSID 1 award\").4 The parties to that arbitration had further agreed on a financial model to be applied to calculate tariffs under the PPA. Payments were made pursuant to that award, but as of January 2007, TANESCO failed to make further payments to IPTL.\n\nExh. C-10/R-8, also available on the ICSID website.\n\n24.\n\nFrom October 2006 onwards, IPTL did not service its lenders through which it had secured the original financing for the project. IPTL\u2019s loan was originally subscribed with a consortium of Malaysian lenders who in 2005 sold the loan to SCB HK, the Claimant in this case.\n\n25.\n\nIt should also be noted that IPTL has been at the centre of a legal dispute between its shareholders (VIP and Mechmar) before the Tanzanian courts, and was under the control of a provisional liquidator, while the issue of its winding up was being resolved. The power plant, which had been operated under the control of a provisional liquidator until September 2013, is apparently now under the control of Pan Africa Power Solutions (T) Ltd (\"PAP\") which, the Tribunal understands, has purchased the interest of VIP in IPTL. Both Parties seem to be in agreement that IPTL has not been in control of the plant since October 2009.5 They disagree however on the question of whether an expropriation occurred in October 2009.\n\nRfA, para. 8. Exh. C-14.\n\n26.\n\nAs far as the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is concerned, SCB HK alleges that, further to the occurrence of an event of default under IPTL\u2019s loan, in its capacity of Security Agent acting as agent for and on behalf of the lenders, it is entitled to bring this proceeding as IPTL\u2019s assignee under the PPA. The Claimant argues that IPTL\u2019s contractual rights under the PPA have been vested in SCB HK and it is requesting from the Tribunal, *inter alia,* a declaration that TANESCO owes it outstanding payments in the sum of US$258.7 million, and an order to pay it US$138 million to discharge its loan, or alternatively to pay it the amounts due under the PPA.6\n\n*See infra* para. 196, for the Claimant\u2019s latest request for relief.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that SCB HK\u2019s alleged security assignment is void against IPTL\u2019s liquidator and creditors, and that SCB HK should have obtained leave from the Tanzanian High Court before proceeding to arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nOn the merits, it is disputed between the Parties whether IPTL\u2019s equity contribution to the project could have been made by way of a shareholder loan, as it had been, rather than by way of subscription for shares. The Respondent claims that IPTL substituted a shareholder loan for equity, thus distorting the agreed financial model to calculate the capacity payments, and resulting in substantially overcharging TANESCO and rewarding IPTL a higher rate of return than agreed.7 Thus, for the Respondent, IPTL engaged in misrepresentation and/or breached its contractual obligations to TANESCO, resulting in tariff overcharges.8 While having paid more than US$150 million in capacity payments, the Respondent would now owe SCB HK more than the original approved debt; for the Respondent, this is the result of the unauthorized refinancing of IPTL\u2019s debt and the diversion of funds intended to pay the senior debt for the payment of costs that were not authorized as project costs.9\n\nResp. CM, para. 10.\n\nResp. CM, para. 11.\n\nResp. CM, para. 13.\n\n29.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent objects to the various payment calculations and asks for a rectification of the tariff calculation model.\n\n**IV. Factual Background**\n--------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal will provide a description of the factual background to this dispute.\n\n**A. The PPA and related agreements - 1995 - 1998**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn response to a power shortage in Tanzania in the early 1990\u2019s, on May 26, 1995, TANESCO and IPTL entered into the PPA, whereby IPTL agreed to design, construct, own, operate and maintain an electricity generating facility with a nominal net capacity of 100 megawatts, to be located in Tegeta, Tanzania. Pursuant to the PPA, and a related Implementation Agreement,10 which included a guarantee, executed between IPTL and the GoT, IPTL was to deliver electricity generated by the plant to TANESCO for a period of 20 years. The power plant was designed to work only at times of peak demand and has not been running on a continuous basis.11 The applicable law under the PPA is Tanzanian law.\n\nExh. C-28/R-90.\n\nRfA, para. 18.\n\n32.\n\nThe financial assumptions for the project were that the projected cost was of US$163.5 million; the debt/equity ratio was at 70% senior debt and 30% equity; the amortization for the 70% senior debt was at 7 years (later changed to 8 years in 1998) and the internal rate of return on equity was at 23% (later corrected to 22.31% by agreement of the parties after the ICSID 1 award).12 These assumptions, the ICSID 1 tribunal was later to determine, were reflected in a letter from IPTL to the GoT on May 31, 1995.13 The May 31, 1995 letter stated in relevant part:\n\nWe refer to our telephone conversation of yesterday and hereby wish to confirm that the following assumptions used to determine the capacity charge are contained in the MECHMAR proposal submitted to the Government in November 1994 which was the basis of negotiations and agreements reached in January, 1995.\n\n1) Project Cost US$163.5 million (1994)\n\n2) Senior Debt 70%\n\n3) Equity 30%\n\n4) Aggregate Interest Rate for Senior Debt 10,940%\n\n5) Amortisation 7 years\n\n6) Tax Holiday 5 years\n\n7) Capacity Factor 85%\n\n8) Levelized Discount Rate 10%\n\n9) Fixed Operating Costs/Year US$4.3 million\n\n10) Hours in the Year 8,760\n\n11) IRR 23%\n\n12) Degraded Heat Rate (BTU/kWhHHV) 8,913\n\nYou will notice that the main factor which can alter the capacity charge is the Total Project cost item of US$ 163.5 million and we have made a provision in the agreement with TANESCO that any changes in the stated assumptions will result in adjustments in the Reference Tariff proportionately.\n\nAt the moment the PPA is talking about the Reference Tariff and not the Final Tariff and we agreed with the Minister and the Principal Secretary before they left for Canada that in view of the clarifications we provided you would seek the approval of State House so that we sign the PPA immediately as directed by the Cabinet but mentioning the Reference Tariff.\n\nYou know very well that the process of negotiations with the Banks for the Debt Financing component takes between 4-6 months and we have already lost 5 months since January, 1995 when we completed negotiations waiting for the PPA to be signed. We request you to authorise TANESCO to sign the PPA now mentioning the Reference Tariff so that we can take the documents to the Banks for debt negotiations and any justifiable changes can be done by way of side memoranda or addendum to the Agreement.\n\n[...]\n\nResp. CM, para. 3.\n\nExh. C-38 (IPTL\u2019s letter dated May 31, 1995).\n\n33.\n\nThe financial models used by IPTL at the time in order to structure financing for the project, including the 1995 Model (the \"1995 Financial Model\"),14 were not provided to TANESCO.15 It has also been argued that a model developed by IPTL in May 1998,16 was not provided to TANESCO.\n\nExh. R-99 (1995 Financial Model).\n\nCl. PHB, para. 43.\n\nExh. R-98 (1998 Financial Model).\n\n34.\n\nInitially, there had been an agreement on a fixed price contract, but in Addendum No. 1 to the PPA, dated June 9, 1995 (\"Addendum No. 1\"), a new basis for calculating the Reference Tariff in the PPA was provided, as follows: *\"Before commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff [...] will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any or all the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement.\"17*\n\nExh. C-39.\n\n35.\n\nPayments (capacity and energy payments, supplemental charges, bonus payments, as well as interest on overdue payments) under the PPA were to be made to IPTL on a monthly basis for a term of 20 years. Capacity payments and energy payments to be made after the commencement of commercial operation, which constituted the \"Reference Tariff\u2019, had been computed on the basis of assumptions mentioned in the appendices of the PPA.18\n\nResp. PHB, para. 20. PPA, Art. 5.1 and 1.1. *See* Appendix B to the PPA.\n\n36.\n\nIPTL had been formed in 1994 by Mechmar, a Malaysian corporation, and VIP, a Tanzanian company. VIP held 30% of the shares of IPTL, and Mechmar held the remaining 70%.19 IPTL\u2019s authorized share capital was of US$10 million and its paid up share capital was equivalent to US$100.20\n\nCl. Mem., para. 23, Exh. C-48/R-45 (Shareholders Agreement between Mechmar and VIP).\n\n*See e.g.,* Cl. Rep., para. 112.\n\n37.\n\nIPTL raised funds to establish the power plant by means of a credit facility extended to it by a consortium of Malaysian banks21 under a US$105 million 1997 Loan Facility Agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\" or \"Facility Agreement\")22 to be repaid over 8 years. The loan contemplated a debt/equity ratio of 70/30.23\n\nBank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad (BBMB) as arranging bank and facility agent, Sime Bank Berhad as security agent and arranging bank, BBMB International Bank (L) Limited and Sime International Bank (L) Limited both as lenders, Cl. Mem., para. 49, Resp. PHB, para. 33.\n\nExh. C-ll/R-47.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 52.\n\n38.\n\nIPTL did not draw down the full US$105 million under the loan, but drew down approximately US$85 million between August 1997 and January 2000.24\n\nResp. PHB, para. 35. Exh. C-43.\n\n39.\n\nOn June 28, 1997, IPTL entered into a Security Deed (the \"Security Deed\"), with Sime Bank Berhad, which provided securities to the lenders, including right, title and interest to various contracts including the PPA. The Security Deed is governed by English law.25 Under the 1997 Security Deed and the Loan Agreement, Sime Bank Berhad of Malaysia (and later its successors RHB Bank Berhad and Danaharta)26 was appointed as Security Agent.\n\nClause 20.1 of the Security Deed, Exh. C-16/R-68. Cl. Mem., footnote 32: *\"The Security Deed was between IPTL and Sime Bank Berhad \"in its capacity as Security Agent under the Facility Agreement... which expression includes any successor appointed as Security Agenf (C-16 at page 486). Clause 22(H) of the Facility Agreement details the procedure for the replacement of Security Agents (C-11 at page 421).\"*\n\nCl. Mem., para. 84(3): *\"The interest of the final original lender, Sime Bank, was transferred to RHB Bank Berhad (\"RHB\") through an order of the High Court of Malaysia dated 29 June 1999 (the \"Vesting Order\"). [Exh. C-53] The Vesting Order operated to transfer the entire banking business of Sime Bank to RHB. [Exh. C-53] RHB subsequently novated its rights under the Facility Agreement to Danaharta in July 2001. [Exh. C-54]\".*\n\n40.\n\nA Mortgage of Right of Occupancy between IPTL and Sime Bank Berhad as mortgagee was also entered into.27\n\nResp. PHB, para. 34.\n\n41.\n\nOn June 28, 1997, Mechmar and VIP also pledged their shares to the Security Agent under a Charge of Shares (the \"Share Pledge Agreement\")28 as security for the loan. On the same day, Mechmar and VIP together with IPTL and the Security Agent entered into a Shareholder Support Deed (the \"Shareholder Support Deed\").29 Under the Shareholder Support Deed, the Shareholders\u2019 Funds could be subscribed by way of ordinary shares or the provision of subordinated loans to IPTL.30 The shareholders also undertook not to take any action in furtherance of the winding up, liquidation or dissolution of IPTL.31 Mechmar also undertook specific obligations under the Shareholder Support Deed such as to guarantee to the Security Agent that it would pay any sum payable under the financing agreements if IPTL did not do so.32\n\nExh.

C-40, Art. 5.1.1.\n\n42.\n\nIt is agreed between the Parties that, as recorded in a letter of May 31, 199 533 from IPTL to the GoT, the assumption of the parties to the PPA was that the debt/equity ratio for the project was to be 70/30. It is disputed whether the equity contribution could be made by way of subordinated shareholder loan, the Respondent\u2019s position being that it was not allowed. It is undisputed, however, that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was in fact made mostly by way of a shareholder loan, and not by way of subscription for shares.34 According to the Claimant, Mechmar made a loan to IPTL in an amount of US$27 million in December 1997, and a further loan of US$33 million in December 1998.35\n\nExh. C-38, quoted above.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 14, *see also* paras. 63-64.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 54. Resp. CM, para. 7, questioning the reality of the 1997 loan and referring to a US$45 million total loan, *see also* Resp. Rej., para. 6.\n\n43.\n\nOn 12 March 1998, the Security Agent, originally Sime Bank Berhad, provided notice to TANESCO that IPTL had assigned the PPA to it as security for the loan provided for in the Facility Agreement.36\n\nExh. C-26. *See infra* paras. 119-125.\n\n**B. The earlier ICSID proceedings and the origin of the dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn 1998, prior to commercial operation, TANESCO submitted to ICSID a request for arbitration against IPTL claiming that it was entitled to terminate the PPA or, alternatively, to obtain a material reduction of the tariff because the cost of the facility was excessive. IPTL submitted a counterclaim against TANESCO for damages. A tribunal composed of Mr. Kenneth S. Rokison, a national of the United Kingdom (President), Mr. Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States of America, and Mr. Andrew Rogers, a national of Australia (the \"ICSID 1 tribunal\"), issued an award on July 12, 2001 (the \"ICSID 1 award\").37\n\nExh. C-10/R-8, also available on the ICSID website.\n\n45.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal decided that TANESCO had no right to terminate the PPA, which was and remained valid and took note of the Reference Tariff agreed upon by the parties. Based on the tribunal\u2019s initial rulings, the parties had adjusted the financial model that would be used to calculate the capacity and energy tariffs after commercial operation started. That adjusted financial model was submitted to the tribunal pursuant to a \"Stipulation and Agreement\" between TANESCO and IPTL and incorporated into the award as Appendix F. The 2001 ICSID 1 award reduced the cost of the project from US$163.5 million to US$127.2 million,38 with a senior debt of US$89 million (further reduced to US$85.3 million)39 and the remainder (approximately US$38 million) in equity. The costs that the ICSID 1 tribunal deemed not to have been prudently incurred and disregarded when calculating the tariff, are referred to as the \"Disallowed Costs.\" These costs were to be the sole responsibility of IPTL.\n\nFurther reduced to US$121.5 million by agreement of the parties, Cl. Mem., para. 74. *See* Resp. CM, para. 69.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 86.\n\n46.\n\nAlthough the plant had been completed in 1998, the commercial operation of the facility did not start until January 2002, after the ICSID 1 proceeding. According to the Claimant, the plant has been called upon to generate some electricity during each month from January 2002 to April 2007, as well as in June 2007, in March 2008 and from November 2009 to October 2011.40\n\nCl. Mem., para. 76 indicating that TANESCO did not produce information after October 2011.\n\n47.\n\nHowever, according to the Claimant, TANESCO failed to make the required capacity payments, alleging that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution had been made by way of shareholder loan rather than subscription for shares. It also stopped making the other payments to IPTL due under the PPA as of April 2007.41 An invoice dispute was formally raised on June 17, 2004, by TANESCO.42 It then started making monthly payments into an escrow account established with the Bank of Tanzania.43 Counsel for the Respondent indicated at the March hearing that the amount currently in that account is about US$90 million.44\n\nCl. Mem., para. 173.\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 76 and *seq.*\n\nResp. CM, para. 124.\n\nMr. Range, Tr. March 15, 2013, page 124, line 13. Statement of accounts of November 23, 2011, Exh. C-106.\n\n48.\n\nIn June 2008, IPTL filed with ICSID an application for interpretation of the ICSID 1 award.45 The ICSID 1 tribunal was recomposed for an interpretation proceeding and reconstituted following the resignation of Judge Charles Brower. The Members of the tribunal were Messrs. Rokison and Rogers and Mr. Makhdoom Ali-Khan, a national of Pakistan.\n\nExh. C-12 (Request for interpretation filed by Nixon Peabody). Both Parties seem to agree that it was at the time the short lived administrator of IPTL who authorized the proceeding, and not the Provisional Liquidator, *see* Tr. March 15, 2013, page 88.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it was Mechmar who had made the application for interpretation on behalf of IPTL, without securing first VIP\u2019s authorization or the authorization of IPTL\u2019s Provisional Liquidator.46 SCB HK sought to intervene in that proceeding as assignee under the PPA but its intervention was not accepted.47\n\nResp. PHB. para. 96. *See* section E below for the details on IPTL\u2019s liquidation.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 116. Mr. Weiniger, Tr. March 15, 2013, page 128, lines 7-10: *\"The simplest explanation is that under the ICSID rules, only a party can bring interpretation proceedings, and the Bank was not a party. \"* Mr. Range, Tr. March 15, 2013, pages 133, lines 24-25, page 134, lines 1-4: *\"The reason why that ended the way it did is that they decided [...] to give up their application to intervene in the interpretation proceedings because they were informed, accurately, that IPTL had decided to discontinue the interpretation proceeding.\"*\n\n50.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal issued an order for discontinuance of the case on August 19, 2010, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 44.48 The Respondent contends that Mechmar requested the discontinuance, while the Claimant argues that it was the Provisional Liquidator who made the request.49\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 44 \"Discontinuance at Request of a Party\" reads as follow: *\"If a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall in an order fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance. If no objection is made in writing within the time limit, the other party shall be deemed to have acquiesced in the discontinuance and the Tribunal, or if appropriate the Secretary-General, shall in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding. If objection is made, the proceeding shall continue.\"*\n\nResp. PHB, para. 97; Cl. Mem., para. 117.\n\n51.\n\nAnother ICSID arbitration was also initiated by SCB, the Claimant\u2019s parent company, in May 2010, against the Republic of Tanzania (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12) on the basis of the 1994 UK-Tanzania bilateral investment treaty.50 That case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on November 2, 2012.51 SCB filed an application for annulment of the award. The application for annulment was registered by ICSID on February 11, 2013, and the case is currently suspended by agreement of the parties to that proceeding.52\n\nExh. R-76 (SCB\u2019s Request for Arbitration).\n\nThe award dated November 2, 2012 is available on the ICSID website.\n\n*See* ICSID website, Procedural Details, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12.\n\n**C. The IPTL\u2019s debt restructurings - 2001 - 2003**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Parties do not agree on the consequences of the ICSID 1 award in respect of the amounts due to IPTL\u2019s lenders. It is not disputed, however, that in 2001 and 2003, a refinancing of the 1997 Loan Agreement took place.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in 2001, Mechmar, purporting to act in IPTL\u2019s name, and Danaharta Managers (L) Ltd. (\"Danaharta\")53 - a Malaysian governmental institution created to remove non-performing loans from the Malaysian financial system - replaced the 1997 Loan Agreement with two new loans (\"Term Loans 1 and 2\") and extended the amortization period from 8 years to 10 years.54 The Respondent maintains that TANESCO had no knowledge of this restructuring. The new loans amounted to over US$120 million, more than the senior debt authorized by the ICSID 1 award, and allegedly included penalty interest that had accrued on the original Loan Agreement prior to the commencement of commercial operations.55\n\nDanaharta was previously Sime International Bank (L) Limited, one of the original lenders. It changed its name in January 2009. *See* Cl. Mem., para. 84.\n\nResp. CM, paras. 94 and *seq.,* para. 118. Resp. PHB, paras. 65 and *seq.*\n\nResp. CM, para. 92.\n\n54.\n\nIn addition, according to the Respondent, in May 2001, Mechmar obtained a short-term loan from Danaharta in the amount of US$5.2 million, which was repaid by October 2002, as it had been ranked in priority to other loans extended to IPTL, including the senior debt.56\n\nResp. CM, para. 93.\n\n55.\n\nFurthermore, the operations and management contractor responsible for constructing the facility, Wartsila, obtained through an alleged \"secret side-deal\" a loan from Danaharta for US$32 million, which also had higher priority than the other loans extended to IPTL, including the senior debt.57\n\nResp. CM, paras. 95 and *seq.* Resp. PHB, paras. 70 and *seq.*\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, all of this altered the waterfall of payments with the final result that IPTL paid down the senior debt more slowly than agreed, with 13.3% paid down in the first three years instead of 60%.58 The Claimant does not dispute the restructuring or the new loans but claims that the changed waterfall of payments resulted in the senior lender being paid off more quickly.59\n\nResp. CM, para. 103.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 184.\n\n**D. The SCB HK\u2019s involvement - 2005 onwards**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nIt is not disputed by the Parties that by 2005, Danaharta was the sole lender under the Facility Agreement.60 Further to an auction of distressed debt, in August 2005, SCB HK acquired from Danaharta, for US$76.1 million,61 Term Loans 1 and 2, which had a face value of US$101.7 million, and became the sole lender to IPTL.62 Under that transaction, SCB HK was assigned a number of contracts, including the 1997 Security Deed, the Implementation Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement concluded between IPTL and the GoT.63\n\n*See* Cl.

SCB HK was appointed as Security Agent on 4 November 2009 and duly accepted such appointment (see C-58). This took place after SCB Malaysia had earlier declined the appointment (see letter to SCB Malaysia dated 29 October 2009 at C-59 and letter from SCB Malaysia to SCB HK at C-60).\" See* Cl. Mem., para. 120 and Cl. Mem., paras. 210-211.\n\n60.\n\nFrom 2006 onwards, IPTL failed to pay the amounts due towards its interest and principal repayments. This led to the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement.\n\n61.\n\nUnder clause 8 of the Security Deed, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, IPTL is no longer authorized to exercise and enforce the rights, discretions and remedies conferred on it under the PPA. Those rights, discretions and remedies are instead exercisable by the Security Agent acting as agent for and on behalf of the lenders. Subsequent to the occurrence of the event of default, SCK HK exercised the step-in rights conferred on it. It therefore considers IPTL\u2019s contractual rights under the PPA to have been vested in SCB HK.\n\n62.\n\nIn December 2009, IPTL and TANESCO were notified of the occurrence of an event of default by the Facility Agent under the Financing Documents.67 Subsequently, steps were taken to enforce the security interests created by IPTL in favour of the Security Agent, SCB HK.68\n\nExh.

Letter from Standard Chartered Malaysia to SCB HK dated December 15, 2009.\n\n63.\n\nIn addition, SCB HK\u2019s charge over the shares pledged by VIP and Mechmar also became enforceable.\n\n**E. The IPTL shareholders\u2019 dispute and IPTL\u2019s status - 2001 onwards**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nOn or around 2001, certain disputes arose between the Malaysian majority shareholder of IPTL, Mechmar, and the Tanzanian minority shareholder, VIP.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to the Claimant:\n\nVIP argued that the costs that the ICSID 1 Tribunal had disallowed for the purpose of tariff calculations should not be included in IPTL\u2019s accounts when calculating VIP\u2019s profits to be earned as a shareholder in IPTL. Instead, VIP contended those costs should be counted only against the other shareholder of IPTL, Mechmar. Similarly, VIP contended that the costs associated with the delay in the operation of the Power Plant should be for Mechmar\u2019s account alone, and not counted when calculating the value of VIP\u2019s shares.69\n\nVIP argued that if those costs were removed from the accounts of IPTL and put on the books of Mechmar, then the value of its shares at that point in time would have been US$31,273,783. It asked that Mechmar pay it this amount. Mechmar did not agree. VIP then demanded that Mechmar represent in writing to third parties that VIP\u2019s shares were valued at US$31 million. When Mechmar refused to do so, VIP began a series of actions to *\"strongarm\"* Mechmar into acceding to its wishes.70\n\nCl. Mem., para. 78.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 78.\n\n66.\n\nAccording to the Respondent:\n\nMechmar argued that IPTL should bear all of the disapproved costs, while VIP maintained that only the costs approved by the ICSID 1 Tribunal should be borne by IPTL, and that Mechmar alone should bear the disapproved costs. Mr. Rugemalira believed that Mechmar deliberately inflated project costs, and that therefore all disallowed costs should be assigned to Mechmar and not to IPTL.71\n\nResp. PHB, para. 55. Mr. Rugemalira was the Director of IPTL and author of the May 31, 2005 letter to GoT.\n\n67.\n\nOn February 25, 2002, VIP petitioned the High Court of Tanzania for the winding up of IPTL. VIP also requested various forms of provisional relief including that the Court appoint a provisional liquidator over IPTL.\n\n68.\n\nMechmar also commenced an arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (the \"LCIA\") to decide the dispute between Mechmar and VIP pursuant to the Promoters/Shareholders Agreement. An award was issued on August 26, 2003 (the \"LCIA award\")72 directing VIP to discontinue the winding up proceedings it had initiated against IPTL before the High Court of Tanzania. Mechmar\u2019s attempts to enforce the LCIA award in Tanzania are said to have been to no avail.73\n\nExh. C-45.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that there were allegations of various proceedings between SCB and Mechmar in Malaysia and in the British Virgin Islands.\n\n69.\n\nOn November 21, 2008, SCB HK applied to the High Court of Tanzania seeking an order to restrain VIP from continuing with the winding up, which was dismissed by the Court for want of prosecution. In December 2008, pursuant to its rights under a Charge of Shares of VIP in IPTL, RHB Bank Berhad, acting as security agent for SCB HK, appointed, Ms. M. K. Renju, as Receiver over the Mechmar shares.74\n\nCl. PHB, para. 27(16). Exh. C-153.\n\n70.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, the Tanzanian High Court appointed a Provisional Liquidator (the \"PL\"), an appointment to which Mechmar objected. A few days later, SCB HK informed the PL that it held security over IPTL\u2019s assets under the Security Deed.75\n\nCl. Mem., para. 119.\n\n71.\n\nOn January 27, 2009, upon SCB HK\u2019s request made a few days earlier, the High Court of Tanzania appointed *ex parte* an administrator over IPTL (the \"Administrator\"). On the ground that notice should have been issued to all of the interested parties, the appointment of the Administrator was set aside by the Tanzanian Court of Appeal on April 9, 2009.76 SCB HK withdrew its first petition and filed a second petition to appoint an Administrator on September 17, 2009 (\"SCB HK\u2019s Second Administration Petition\").\n\nExh. C-302/R-152, page 6.\n\n72.\n\nAround October 2009, according to the Claimant, the GoT took control of the power plant, and the PL and TANESCO entered into an interim PPA on February 5, 2010 (the \"Interim PPA\").77 According to the Claimant, *\"[t]he PL has not properly accounted for monies received pursuant to the interim operation of the Plant. Despite repeated requests by SCB HK, the PL has failed to disclose detailed accounts reflecting the current state of IPTL\u2019s finances\"78*\n\nCl. Mem., para. 122.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 124.\n\n73.\n\nOn September 15, 2010, SCB HK filed its request for arbitration with ICSID.\n\n74.\n\nOn July 15, 2011, an order for IPTL\u2019s winding up was issued by the High Court of Tanzania, and the winding up was deemed to have commenced February 25, 2002 - the date of the petition (the \"2011 Winding Up Order\").79 The Court appointed a liquidator under the Tanzanian Companies Ordinance (the \"Liquidator\").\n\nLetter of the Liquidator dated July 10, 2012, para. 7, and order under Exh. 2 to that letter.\n\n75.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, the Liquidator issued a notice directing IPTL\u2019s creditors to submit their claims against IPTL\u2019s estate by April 24, 2012.80 According to TANESCO, Wartsila asserted a claim for over US$22 million in the liquidation proceeding.81\n\nTANESCO\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 40. Exh.

The letter was transmitted to the Parties, who provided their comments to the Tribunal. Commenting on this letter, TANESCO submitted that the Tribunal should stay the proceeding to allow SCB HK to seek a declaration of the validity of its claimed assignment in Tanzanian courts where the Liquidator could be joined as a party.83\n\nTANESCO\u2019s Comment on Submission of the Liquidator of IPTL, August, 15, 2012, para. 33.\n\n78.\n\nIn August 2012, ICSID received from VIP a copy of its letters dated July 31, 2012, and August 25, 2012, sent to the Liquidator claiming *inter alia* that SCB HK is not a creditor of IPTL. The letter was transmitted to the Parties, who provided their comments to the Tribunal.\n\n79.\n\nOn December 17, 2012, the Court of Appeal in the Civil Revision Proceeding No. 1 vacated all proceedings in the winding-up petition retroactive to July 17, 2009, including the Winding up Order of July 15, 2011, and directed that the matter be considered by the High Court.84 The Court of Appeal decided that the High Court should not have appointed a liquidator in 2011 while SCB HK\u2019s Second Administration Petition to appoint an administrator to IPTL was pending. The Court of Appeal remitted the matter to the High Court for consideration.\n\nExh. R-152, page 27. *Also* Exh. C-295.\n\n80.\n\nThe Parties are in disagreement as to the consequences of that decision on the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, as will be explained below.\n\n81.\n\nOn February 17, 2013, VIP requested the High Court to have the administration proceeding expedited, allegedly given the absence of steps taken by SCB HK.85\n\nExh. R-159 (new exhibit handed out at the March hearing). Mr. Range, Tr. March 14, 2013, page 144.\n\n82.\n\nIn April 2013, ICSID received a new letter from VIP\u2019s Dutch counsel which was transmitted to the Parties and the Tribunal and regarding which the Parties declined to comment.\n\n83.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, ICSID received a letter from the PL from IPTL, Mr. Saliboko, which was transmitted to the Parties and the Tribunal and regarding which the Parties declined to comment.\n\n84.\n\nOn September 5, 2013, the High Court of Tanzania made an order (i) permitting VIP to withdraw its winding up petition in respect of IPTL, (ii) terminating the appointment of the PL, and (iii) ordering IPTL\u2019s affairs, including the plant, to be handed over to PAP, which purported to have acquired VIP\u2019s 30% shareholding in IPTL.86 SCB HK also indicated that it has also withdrawn its administration petition.\n\nSCB HK\u2019s letter to the Tribunal, November 27, 2013, attaching the Order of the High Court of Tanzania dated September 5, 2013.\n\n85.\n\nAccording to SCB HK, at the end of 2013, there was *\"no winding-up petition or substantive administration petition in respect of IPTL pending before the Tanzanian courts, and no prospect of a liquidator or administrator being appointed.\"87* SCB HK further indicated that it had been informed that TANESCO had entered into an agreement with IPTL to settle the outstanding tariff payments under the PPA that are in issue in these proceedings, thereby facilitating release of the funds placed in escrow by the GoT as security for TANESCO\u2019s obligations under the PPA. SCB HK concluded that it was concerned about this deterioration in its position and requested an award as soon as possible.\n\nSCB HK\u2019s letter to the Tribunal, November 27, 2013, attaching the Order of the High Court of Tanzania dated September 5, 2013.\n\n86.\n\nTANESCO responded on December 13, 2013, noting that SCB HK had not sought to block the sale of VIP\u2019s shareholding to PAP; that the agreement by PAP to sell electricity to TANESCO at reduced tariffs is not a change in practice and is not a deterioration in SCB HK\u2019s position; that TANESCO had no control over the escrow account agreement whose parties are the GoT, IPTL and Bank of Tanzania. TANESCO disagreed with SCB HK that there is no longer any prospect of a liquidator or administrator being appointed over IPTL.\n\n87.\n\nIt appears that, at the present time, control over IPTL has been asserted by Ms. M. K. Renju as administrative receiver appointed in 2008 by SCB HK.88\n\nExh. 4 to TANESCO\u2019s letter of December 13, 2013, Notice of Appointment\n\n88.\n\nIt also appears that Mechmar is under liquidation in Malaysia.89\n\nParties\u2019 respective letters of November 27 and December 13, 2013.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal was also informed that on November 12, 2013, VIP filed suit in the High Court in Tanzania against SCB, SCB HK, Wartsila and the liquidators of Mechmar.90 According to the Respondent, VIP\u2019s Complaint (i) seeks damages for losses it suffered from the unlawful restructuring of IPTL\u2019s debt, (ii) challenges the legality of SCB\u2019s/SCB HK\u2019s alleged purchase of the debt in 2005 from Danaharta, and (iii) seeks a declaration that SCB/SCB HK lacks standing as a valid creditor or as a valid secured creditor of IPTL. VIP also seeks damages of almost US$500 million from the defendants.91\n\nExh. 1 to TANESCO\u2019s letter of December 13, 2013.\n\nTANESCO\u2019s letter of December 13, 2013.\n\n**V. The Positions of the Parties on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 positions on jurisdiction have evolved throughout this proceeding in light of events in the Tanzanian courts.\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s position on jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent first contended that SCB HK\u2019s interests were void against the Liquidator because the security interest had not been registered with the Companies Registrar in Tanzania (1). Further to the decision of the Court of Appeal of December 17, 2012, referred above at paragraph 79, it more recently contended that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because SCB HK failed to obtain leave of the High Court to enforce its security assignment (2).\n\n**1. SCB HK\u2019s interests were not registered**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent contends that because SCB HK failed to register with the Companies Registrar in Tanzania both the security assignment of IPTL\u2019s interests in the assigned contracts under clause 3.2 of the Security Deed, and the specific charges created by clause 3.1 of the Security Deed, these interests are void against the Liquidator of IPTL.92\n\nResp. CM, para. 135.\n\n93.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, SCB HK was wrong when it considered that the assignment of the PPA was an absolute assignment and need not be registered. The Respondent argues that, while an absolute assignment needs no registration, an assignment by way of charge or a security assignment must be registered under Tanzanian law, which follows English companies law.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the security assignment under clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed had to be registered or it was void by virtue of section 79 of the Tanzanian Companies Ordinance 2002, because it was a charge on book debts or a floating charge.93\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply to the Claimant\u2019s Opposition to Bifurcation of Proceedings, para. 14. CLA-10.\n\n**2. SCB HK failed to obtain leave of the High Court to enforce its security assignment - the consequence of the December 17, 2012 decision**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIn its PHB, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\nDismiss the arbitration for lack of jurisdiction, or stay the arbitration pending a determination by the High Court of Tanzania as to whether SCB HK should be granted leave to enforce its claimed security as provided in Section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002.94\n\nResp. PHB, para. 342.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the consequence of the decision of the Court of Appeal of December 17, 2012, is as follows:\n\nThe Court further held that under Section 249 of the Tanzanian Companies Act 2002, the presentation of the Second Administration Petition to the High Court resulted in a \"freeze\" or automatic stay (i) on the pending Winding Up Petition filed by VIP Engineering and Marketing Ltd. (\"VIP\") against Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\"); (ii) on any effort by a creditor of IPTL to enforce its security; and (iii) on any suit against IPTL, without first obtaining leave of the High Court. As a result, the Court of Appeal vacated all proceedings in the Winding Up Petition retroactive to 17 July 2009. It also directed the High Court to consider the merits of SCB HK\u2019s Second Administration Petition, including the threshold questions of whether SCB HK was a creditor of IPTL or had proper standing.95\n\nResp. PHB, para. 2.\n\n97.\n\nFor the Respondent, Section 249 of the Tanzanian Companies Act 2002 applies with the result that SCB HK should have obtained the leave from the High Court to enforce its security. It argues that the Court of Appeal held that SCB HK was *\"barred by Section 249 of the Companies Act 2002 from invoking [the PPA arbitration clause] until and unless it obtain[ed] leave of the High Court to enforce its claimed security assignment.\"96* It is alleged that the Court of Appeal directed the High Court to consider the merits of SCB HK\u2019s Second Administration Petition, including whether SCB HK was a creditor of IPTL or had proper standing.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 1.\n\n98.\n\nOn the basis of this second argument, on February 20, 2013, the Respondent renewed its request to bifurcate the case and dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction. Alternatively, TANESCO requested the Tribunal to stay the case pending further proceedings in the Tanzanian courts until:\n\n(i) SCB HK applies for and obtains leave of the High Court to pursue this claim, on such conditions as the Court may direct; or (ii) an administrator for IPTL is appointed and that administrator authorizes SCB HK to pursue this claim, on such conditions as the administrator may provide; or (iii) the Second Administration Petition is dismissed on such terms, if any, as would permit SCB HK to proceed with this arbitration.97\n\nResp. PHB, para. 5.\n\n99.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argued, SCB\u2019s HK security interest is void against a liquidator or an administrator (should an administrator be appointed) for lack of registration.\n\n**B. The Claimant\u2019s position on jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant considers that as legal assignee it is entitled to exercise all rights and remedies in relation to the PPA. *\"Therefore, no standing issues arise, and the Tribunal should proceed to issue an award in SCB HK\u2019s favour. \"98*\n\nCl. PHB, para. 7.\n\n**1. Section 249 of the Ordinance Act has no extra territorial effect**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nAt the March 2013 hearing, the Claimant argued that the Respondent\u2019s objections under section 249 were untimely.99 It further argued that section 249 is a procedural rule which is not applicable in this proceeding and in any case it has no extra territorial effect.100 It is equivalent to an anti-suit injunction;101 it is a procedural moratorium which does not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 107.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 124, line 2.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 109, line 22.\n\n**2. On the issue of obtaining a leave from the High Court - the consequence of the December 17, 2012 decision**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nFor the Claimant, the 2011 Winding up Order has been set aside and IPTL is no longer in liquidation. Until September 2013, it was under the control of the PL who had been appointed in December 2008.102\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 6 and 386. It appears that the Administrative Receiver appointed by SCB HK, Ms. Renju, now claims that she has authority over IPTL (Notice of Appointment of Administrative Receiver of IPTL dated September 6, 2013 - Exh. 4 to TANESCO\u2019s letter dated December 13, 2013).\n\n103.\n\nIn addition, the Companies Ordinance renders a registrable but unregistered charge void as against a liquidator or secured creditor, but not as against a provisional liquidator.103 For the Claimant, the reference in section 79 to the \"Liquidator\" does not apply to the PL.104 Accordingly, following the December 17, 2012 decision, the assignment of the PPA is valid, irrespective of whether it was required to be registered.105\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 393 and *seq.*\n\nCl. PHB, para. 396.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 386.\n\n**3. On the issue of registration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nAccording to the Claimant,\n\n(1) In the alternative, [... ] the assignment of the PPA was not required to be registered, as it is neither a charge on book debts nor a floating charge; and\n\n(2) In the further alternative, [... ] even if the assignment of the PPA was required to be registered and is therefore caught by the invalidation provisions of the Companies Ordinance, SCB HK is nonetheless entitled to have the invoice dispute resolved by this Tribunal.106\n\nCl. PHB, para. 8.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant in its initial pleadings had not specified whether it was relying upon clause 3.1 or 3.2 of the Security Deed to assert rights under the PPA.107 The Claimant subsequently clarified, however, that it was relying exclusively upon the assignment of the PPA under clause 3.2 of the Security Deed.108\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 202-203.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Opposition to Bifurcation of Proceedings, para. 11.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant accepted that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed creates a security interest and does not operate as an outright assignment (such as a gift).109 According to the Claimant, clause 3.2.1 is a \"security assignment\" in the form of a mortgage: *\"It operates as an assignment of the benefit of the PPA to SCB HK, subject to an equity of redemption in favour of IPTL.\"110* A mortgage is a \"charge\" pursuant to section 79(10)(a) of the Companies Ordinance. According to the Claimant, however, it is not a charge that is subject to registration because it is neither a charge on book debts nor a floating charge.111\n\nCl. Rep., para. 195. TANESCO had submitted in its Reply to the Claimant\u2019s Opposition to Bifurcation of Proceedings that clause 3.2.1 does not operate as an outright assignment, para. 14; TANESCO\u2019s Submissions Relating to Letter from Liquidator of IPTL, paras. 6-13.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 196.\n\nCl. Rep., paras. 221-222.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant further maintained that the assignment of the PPA pursuant to clause 3.2.1 is a statutory assignment in the sense that it fulfills the conditions set out in section 25(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (the \"SCJA\").112 It follows, according to the Claimant, that SCB HK, as the assignee, acquires all available remedies in relation to the PPA as the assigned contract and is entitled to enforce the same in its own name without joining the assignor.113\n\nCl. Rep., para. 201.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 198.\n\n**VI. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the question of its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and then examine the assignment of the PPA and the impact of the proceedings before Tanzanian courts on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n**A. On the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAlthough the Respondent did not raise any objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal must examine its jurisdiction in light of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In order for the Centre to have jurisdiction over a dispute, four conditions must be satisfied:\n\n- first, a condition *ratione personae:* the dispute must oppose a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State;\n\n- second, a condition *ratione materiae:* the dispute must be a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment;\n\n- third, a condition *ratione voluntatis, i.e.* the Contracting State and the investor must consent in writing that the dispute be settled through ICSID arbitration;\n\n- fourth, a condition *ratione temporis:* the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time.\n\n110.\n\nRegarding the first condition, SCB HK is a company organised under the law of Hong Kong. China is an ICSID Contracting State. TANESCO is an entity wholly owned by Tanzania and designated as an agency of Tanzania pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Tanzania is an ICSID Contracting State.\n\n111.\n\nRegarding the second condition, the Tribunal is satisfied that by virtue of its purchase of the outstanding debt under the loans to IPTL and the assigning of the rights under the relevant agreements, SCB HK has an investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. There is undoubtedly a legal dispute arising out of the investment.\n\n112.\n\nRegarding the existence of consent in writing, as will be explained below (paras. 152-153 *infra),* the Tribunal is satisfied that the arbitration agreement contained in the PPA concluded between IPTL and TANESCO has been assigned to SCB HK.\n\n113.\n\nThe time of consent by IPTL is deemed to be May 26, 1995, the date of the PPA. The Tribunal is satisfied that the ICSID Convention was applicable at the initial time of consent, *i.e.* May 26, 1995 when the PPA was concluded, and on August 17, 2005 when SCB HK became entitled to exercise the rights, discretions and remedies under the PPA.\n\n114.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that the jurisdictional conditions of the ICSID Convention are met.\n\n**B. The impact of the assignment of the PPA and the relevance of proceedings in Tanzania involving IPTL on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The relevant contractual provisions relating to the assignment of the PPA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant relies upon clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed (between IPTL and Sime Bank),114 which reads:\n\n3.2 Assignments: The Borrower [IPTL] with full title guarantee and as continuing security for the payment and discharge of all Liabilities hereby assigns to the Security Agent [now SCB HK] for the benefit of the Secured Creditors:\n\n3.2.1 all its present and future right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Contracts, including all moneys which at any time may be or become payable to the Borrower pursuant thereto and the net proceeds of any claims, awards and judgements which may at the time be receivable or received by the Borrower pursuant thereto [...]115\n\nCl. Mem., para. 203.\n\nExh. C-16.\n\n116.\n\nThe definition of \"Assigned Contracts\" includes the PPA.116\n\nExh.

C-4/R-1, pages 54-55.\n\n**2. The factual background to the assignment of the PPA**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nOn March 12, 1998, the Security Agent under the Facility Agreement and the Security Deed with IPTL, which at the time was Sime Bank Berhad, provided notice to TANESCO that:\n\nIPTL has, as security for the repayment of amounts owing under the Facility Agreement, charged to the Security Agent by way of first legal assignment, all of the rights, title and interest in and to the [PPA] and all benefits accruing to IPTL thereunder.119\n\nExh. C-26.\n\n120.\n\nTANESCO acknowledged receipt of the notice on the same day.120\n\nExh. C-26.\n\n121.\n\nSCB HK acquired the outstanding debt under the loan to IPTL from Danaharta pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated August 4, 2005121 (the \"SPA\"), for the sum of US$76,100,00.00.122 Pursuant to clause 3(1) of the SPA, Danaharta transferred *\"all of its rights, title and interest to the Sale Assets and under the Asset Documentation\"* The \"List of Asset Documentation\" at Schedule 2 to the SPA includes the Security Deed, the PPA, the Facility Agreement and the Shareholder Support Deed.\n\nExh. C-55/R-15. This is not in dispute: TANESCO\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 31.\n\nSchedule 5 to SPA, Exh. C-55/R-15.\n\n122.\n\nAt the option of SCB HK, this transfer was implemented by a Deed of Assignment123 duly executed by Danaharta on August 17, 2005 (the \"Deed of Assignment\"). Clause 2 of the Deed of Assignment reads:\n\nIn consideration of the Purchaser having paid the Assignor the Purchase Price (as defined in the Sale and Purchase Agreement) the Assignor hereby assigns absolutely to the Assignee all of its rights title and interest vested in the Assignor in the Sale Assets and the Asset Documentation.\n\nExh. C-56/R-114 (Deed of Assignment).\n\n123.\n\nSchedule 1 to the Deed of Assignment mirrors Schedule 2 of the SPA and thus includes reference to the Security Deed, the PPA, the Facility Agreement and the Shareholder Support Deed within the definition of the \"Asset Documentation.\"\n\n124.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, *\"In effect, as a result of the transaction SCB HK became the sole lender of record to IPTL in place of Danaharta with the benefit of all of the rights of the previous Project lender.\"124*\n\nCl. Mem., para. 86.\n\n125.\n\nSCB HK appointed itself as the Security Agent within the meaning of the Facility Agreement and the Security Deed by a letter of November 4, 2009.125 (SCB Malaysia had earlier declined the appointment.126) It is noted in that letter that RHB Bank Berhad had been removed from this role by SCB HK\u2019s letter of October 29, 2009.127 The original Security Agent, Sime Bank Berhad, had been succeeded by RHB Bank Berhad in 1999.\n\nExh. C-58.\n\nExh. C-60.\n\nThe letter is at Exh. C-57.\n\n**3. The law applicable to the question of the assignment of the PPA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the validity of the assignment of rights in the PPA must be determined in accordance with Tanzanian law in accordance with the choice of law rule in Article 12(2) of Rome Convention, which, although not binding on this Tribunal, nonetheless sets out a general principle of private international law suitable for application in these proceedings.128\n\nCl. Mem., para. 216; Cl. Rep., para. 192.\n\n127.\n\nIt is also common ground that English judicial decisions prior to July 22, 1920 are binding on the Tanzanian courts, save where subsequently modified in Tanzania, and that English judicial decisions after that date are persuasive authority (especially where they relate to similar statutory provisions and/or there is no relevant Tanzanian authority).129\n\nCl. Rep., para. 192; Additional Statement by Professor Mbunda, paras. 5-7.\n\n**4. The issues to be resolved**\n--------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe object of the alleged assignment effectuated under clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed is a chose-in-action: it is the benefit of the PPA (principally the right to receive various contractual payments from TANESCO) and any corresponding rights to enforce that benefit.\n\n129.\n\nA chose-in-action can be the object of a statutory assignment or an equitable assignment under Tanzanian law (as is the case in English law). If the conditions are fulfilled for a statutory assignment, then the assignee of the chose-in-action acquires a legal right to it and can sue in its own name. An assignment of a chose-in-action which does not conform to the conditions for a statutory assignment is an equitable assignment. Under an equitable assignment, it is generally necessary to have the assignor joined as a claimant.\n\n130.\n\nThe statutory provisions on assignment are set out in section 25(6) of the SCJA, which is the applicable statute in Tanzania. This statute applies equally to an outright sale or gift of a chose-in-action as well as to a mortgage of such a right. A mortgage of such a right is otherwise known as a \"security assignment\" because it is an assignment by way of security that is subject to re-assignment on redemption. It is the Claimant\u2019s submission that the assignment under clause 3.2.1 operates by way of a mortgage because the secured interest is subject to re-assignment on redemption under the PPA. It is conceded by the Claimant that there has been no outright assignment under clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed.\n\n131.\n\nIf the assignment under clause 3.2.1 amounts only to a charge on the chose-in-action, then this does not operate to transfer any proprietary interest and is outside the scope of the statutory provisions. It will only have an effect in equity.\n\n132.\n\nThe **first issue** is thus whether or not a valid mortgage has been created in respect of the benefit of the PPA pursuant to clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed, such that there has been an effective transfer of the legal right to that benefit and all the remedies relating to that benefit to SCB HK, by a statutory assignment in accordance with section 25(6) of the SCJA.\n\n133.\n\nThe **second issue** is the consequence of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the first issue in relation to its jurisdiction, which the Claimant has asserted on the basis of the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3 of the PPA. Subject to the registration point raised below, the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction would appear to be contingent upon the legal right to the benefit of the PPA having passed to SCB HK pursuant to section 25(6) of the SCJA. If this is not the case, and SCB HK merely has an equitable charge over the assets listed in clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed, then this would not be effective to vest SCB HK with the right to arbitrate against TANESCO provided for in clause 18.3 of the PPA. An equitable charge does not, like a mortgage, involve the transfer of ownership to the creditor. Instead, it is the right to have a designated asset of the debtor appropriated to the discharge of the indebtedness from the proceeds of the sale of the asset in question. An equitable charge cannot, therefore, be effective to transfer any rights in respect of the arbitration clause in clause 18.3 of the PPA.\n\n134.\n\nAssuming, for the purposes of this introductory analysis, that there has been a valid transfer of the legal right to the benefit of the PPA to SCB HK pursuant to clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed and section 25(6) of the SCJA, the **third issue** is whether that security interest created by a mortgage was required to be registered under section 79 of the Companies Ordinance in whole or in part. There is no purpose in considering the separate question of whether, on the hypothesis that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed creates an equitable charge over the benefit of the PPA, *that* security interest had to be registered, because if the security interest is merely an equitable charge then the Tribunal is without jurisdiction.\n\n135.\n\nThe **fourth issue** relates to the consequences that follow if the security interest created by clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed was required to be registered in whole or in part but was not registered (there is no dispute that the security interest was not in fact registered). If there has been a valid security interest created by a mortgage pursuant to clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed, then that security interest is generally enforceable against the debtor (IPTL). The perfection of a security interest through registration is required to make it effective against third parties. The purpose of registration is precisely to put third parties on notice of the security interest, so that it is just for the law to make it effective against them. A failure to register a security interest under section 79 of the Companies Ordinance means that it is *\"void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company\"130*\n\nCLA-10, section 79(1).\n\n136.\n\nThis fourth issue was critical at one point of the proceedings because a liquidator was in fact in place in respect of IPTL in Tanzania. It will be recalled that an order for IPTL\u2019s winding up was issued by the High Court of Tanzania on July 15, 2011 and the winding up was deemed to have commenced on February 25, 2002, which was the date of the petition.131 On December 17, 2012, however, the Court of Appeal in the Civil Revision Proceeding No. 1 quashed the 2011 Winding up Order. Its principal reason for doing so was that there was a pending petition by SCB HK to appoint an administrator for IPTL when the High Court had made its Winding up Order and this was an error of law by virtue of section 249(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2002, which reads:\n\n(1) During the period beginning with the presentation of a petition for an administration order and ending with the making of such an order or the dismissal of the petition-\n\n(a) no resolution may be passed or order made for the winding up of the company [\u2026]132\n\nLetter of the Liquidator dated July 10, 2012. *See supra* paras. 77 and *seq.*\n\nRA-59.\n\n137.\n\nAt the time of this Decision, the Tribunal understands that SCB HK has withdrawn its petition for an administration order in respect of IPTL, but that the Parties disagree about the possibility of the future appointment of an administrator or liquidator.133\n\nParties\u2019 respective letters of November 27, 2013 and December 13, 2013.\n\n138.\n\nAlthough the fourth issue is not a live one at the time of rendering this Decision, the Tribunal considers that it is nevertheless prudent to deal with it given the history of the insolvency proceedings in respect of IPTL and the, albeit disputed, possibility that a liquidator or administrator could be appointed in the future.\n\n139.\n\nOn the basis of the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of section 249(1) of the Companies Act 2002, the Respondent filed its \"Renewed Application for Bifurcation or, in the Alternative, for a Stay of this Arbitration\" (\"Renewed Application\") on February 19, 2013. The issues relating to this application were heard by the Tribunal on March 14-15, 2013. In essence, the Respondent submits:\n\nThe Court\u2019s rationale for applying Section 249(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2002 must also apply to Section 249(1)(b), which prohibits SCB HK from seeking to enforce its security without first obtaining leave of the High Court. By force of logic, the automatic stay contained in Section 249 that required the Court to vacate all orders in the Winding Up Petition prior to 17 September 2009 applies equally to SCB HK and its actions related to this arbitration. Since filing the Second Administration Petition on 17 September 2009, SCB HK lost whatever right and authority it might have had to seek to enforce its security without obtaining prior leave of the High Court. As SCB HK has never requested nor been granted leave, SCB HK could not and has not lawfully invoked the arbitration clause in Article 18.3 of the PPA as required for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.134\n\nRespondent\u2019s Renewed Application, para. 22.\n\n140.\n\nOn April 15, 2013, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties affirming its prior decision not to stay the proceedings and not to bifurcate them. The Tribunal undertook to provide its reasons for this affirmation in its Decision and hence this will be addressed as the **fifth issue.**\n\n**a) First issue: was there a valid mortgage and statutory assignment?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed creates a security interest but appear to be divided as to the nature of that interest. It is the Claimant\u2019s submission that clause 3.2.1 amounts to an assignment by way of mortgage. The strongest evidence of this is that there is an express provision that makes the assignment subject to an equity of redemption in clause 16.3 of the Security Deed,135 which reads:\n\nFinal Redemption: Subject and without prejudice to Clause 16.4, upon proof being given to the satisfaction of the Security Agent that all the Liabilities have been discharged in full or that provision acceptable to the Security Agent for such discharge has been made, and that all facilities which might give rise to Liabilities have terminated, the Security Agent shall at the request and cost of the Borrower execute and do all such deeds, acts and things as may be necessary to release the Charged Assets from the Charges.136\n\nCl. Rep., para. 196.\n\nExh. C-16, pages 17-18.\n\n142.\n\nTANESCO has not made the distinction between a mortgage and a charge a primary aspect of its submissions. In fact the distinction is addressed in a single footnote in TANESCO\u2019s Rejoinder:\n\nSCB HK argues that the security assignment is a \"mortgage\" and not a \"charge.\" ***See***  SCB HK Reply Memorial \u00b6195. TANESCO does not believe the Tribunal will find placing these labels on the security assignment is particularly useful in resolving the issue of whether the security needed to be registered. One difficulty is that while the charging language in Section 3.2 appears to create an assignment where \"ownership of the property used as security is transferred to the lender,\" which SCB HK classifies as a \"mortgage,\" the lenders in the Facility Agreement at Section 19(C) contract with IPTL that unless it is in default, the Facility Agent will not allow the Security Agent to exercise the rights, including the step-in rights, granted to the Security Agent in the Security Deed, such that SCB HK\u2019s supposed \"mortgage\" in practice only \"gives the lender recourse to the property used as security in the event that the debt is not repaid,\" which SCB HK says is the essential definition of a \"charge.\" The substance of the business arrangement, and in this regard, even SCB HK acknowledges \"clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed constitutes a \u2018charge\u2019 for the purposes of section 79 of the Tanzanian Companies Ordinance.\" Reply Memorial at \u00b6 221.137\n\nResp. Rej., footnote 5.\n\n143.\n\nTANESCO thus concludes that the nature of the security interest is irrelevant: the critical point in its view is that it had to be registered and it was not and therefore it is void. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this conclusion conflates several issues. The nature of the security interest may have an impact on the scope of rights that SCB HK has in relation to the PPA. Moreover there are two distinct stages of the analysis. The first is the creation of a security interest that is enforceable against the debtor. The second is the perfection of that interest so as to make it effective against third parties. The issue is not, therefore, as simple as *\"whether the security needed to be registered\u2019* as maintained by TANESCO.\n\n144.\n\nSCB HK has argued that the assignment in clause 3.2.1 is a statutory assignment. This is critical to the characterisation of the security interest as a mortgage because the principal difference between a mortgage and an equitable charge is that ownership over the asset is transferred to the creditor pursuant to a mortgage but not on the basis of an equitable charge. For SCB HK to have legal rights to the benefit of the PPA, the assignment of this chose-in-action must satisfy the requirements for a statutory assignment under section 25(6) of the SCJA, which remains in force in Tanzania but which was subsequently replaced in England by section 136 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (the \"LPA\"). These provisions are in substance the same.\n\n145.\n\nIn accordance with section 25(6) of the SCJA,138 there are three requirements for a statutory assignment:\n\na) It must be an \"absolute assignment [...] (not purporting to be by way of charge only)\";\n\nb) The assignment must be made *\"by writing under the hand of the assignor\"',* and\n\nc) Express written notice of the assignment must have been given to the counterparty to the assigned contract.\n\nCLA-64.\n\n146.\n\nSCB HK sets out its submissions on each of these points in its Reply and its legal experts, Professor McCormack and Mr. Zervos, also address these points in their reports. TANESCO did not make submissions on these points in its Rejoinder and they are not addressed by its legal expert, Professor Mbunda.\n\n147.\n\nIn respect of the first requirement, which is identical in terms to section 136 of the LPA, the following analysis appears in *Chitty on Contracts:*\n\nThe assignment must be absolute and not purport to be by way of charge only. **An****assignment by way of mortgage may, however, be absolute within the meaning of****the section,** if there is an express or implied *proviso* for reassignment on repayment of the loan: for the reassignment would involve fresh notice to the debtor, who would thus be in no doubt as to whom he ought to pay the debt. **An assignment of all moneys due or to become due from the debtor, which was expressed to be by way of continuing security for all moneys due from the assignor to the assignee, has been held to be absolute.** On the other hand, where the assignor charged a sum which would become due to him from the debtor as security for advances made to him by the assignee, and assigned his interest in that sum until the advances were repaid to the assignee with interest, this was held to be by way of charge and not within the section... **The test seems to be, has the assignor unconditionally transferred to the assignee for the time being the sole right to the debt in question** ***as against the debtor'!*** **If so, the assignment will be absolute; but if the debtor cannot tell whether to pay the assignor or the assignee without examining the state of accounts between them, it will be held to be by way of charge only.** Much may depend on the language of the particular instrument; in construing it, the court will look at the whole of its language. The words italicised above are of crucial importance, for it is no concern of the debtor whether the assignor and assignee have some private arrangement for the disposal of the debt after it has been paid by the debtor. Thus the fact that the assignee is to hold the proceeds of the debt, or the surplus proceeds beyond a stated amount, on trust for the assignor does not prevent the assignment from being absolute.139 (Emphasis added)\n\nCLA-18, para. 19-012, footnotes omitted.\n\n148.\n\nThe passages in bold are particularly relevant to this case. First, it is clear that an assignment by way of mortgage can be absolute for the purposes of section 25(6) of the SCJA. The authority cited by *Chitty on Contracts* for this proposition is *Tancred v. Delagoa Bay Co,140* which is a case that was decided on the basis of that very provision. Second, the language of clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed tracks the language that is identified as being consistent with an absolute assignment: *\"The Borrower with full title guarantee and as continuing security for the payment of discharge of all Liabilities hereby assigns to the Security Agent* Once again, the authority cited by *Chitty on Contracts* in this respect is also a case decided on the basis of section 25(6) of the SCJA: *Hughes v. Pump House Hotel Co.141* In that case, an assignment of all monies due or to become due to the debtor under a building contract for the purpose of a \"continuing security\" was held absolute and not given by way of charge only. Third, there can be no doubt from clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed that IPTL\u2019s rights to the assigned contracts (including the PPA) have been transferred to the Security Agent (SCB HK) and that TANESCO could not be under any doubt as to whom to pay. Express written notice was given to TANESCO of the assignment of the PPA on March 12, 1998,142 and TANESCO acknowledged receipt of that notice on the same day.143\n\n(1889) 23 QBD 239\n\n[1902] 2 KB 190.\n\nExh. C-26.\n\nExh. C-26.\n\n149.\n\nFinally, it will be recalled that TANESCO has submitted that, by virtue of section 19(c) of the Facility Agreement, the lenders have stipulated to IPTL that unless it is in default, the Facility Agent will not allow the Security Agent to exercise the step-in rights granted to the Security Agent in the Security Deed.144 This does not, however, prevent clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed from effecting a statutory assignment. According to a leading authority on the assignment of contracts: *\"The fact that proceedings to enforce a security assignment cannot be taken until default does not alone render an assignment conditional.\"145*\n\nResp. Rej., footnote 5.\n\nTolhurst, *The Assignment of Contractual Rights* (2006), page 374, CLA-19.\n\n150.\n\nThe assignment envisaged in clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed thus satisfies the first requirement for a statutory assignment. The second and third requirements are also satisfied. The assignment of the PPA was in writing under the hand of IPTL, which executed the Security Deed. Moreover, as previously mentioned, TANESCO was given notice of the assignment on March 12, 2008.146\n\nExh. C-26.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed is a valid statutory assignment of IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA to SCB HK. This was finally accepted by the Respondent in oral submissions at the hearing on March 14, 2013.147\n\nMr. Range, Tr. March 14, 2013, page 165.\n\n**b) Second issue: what are the consequences for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe security assignment that SCB HK has over the benefit of the PPA confers a more extensive range of rights in relation to the PPA than would be the case if clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed had given SCB HK merely an equitable charge over certain assets. By the means of the statutory assignment pursuant to section 25(6) of the SCJA, SCB HK has become the legal owner of the rights arising under the PPA, which must include the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3 of the PPA. Moreover, pursuant to that statutory provision, the assignee of a chose-in-action is conferred *\"the legal right to such debt or**chose in action from the date of such notice, and all legal and other remedies for the same, [...] without the concurrence of the assignor. \"148*\n\nCLA-64.\n\n153.\n\nIt follows that SCB HK is entitled to invoke the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3 of the PPA as a right that has been assigned to it and can bring proceedings against TANESCO without joining IPTL as a party to the action. **The Tribunal thus has jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute.** The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends in particular to the questions of whether there is a valid security assignment and whether the security interest had to be registered. This is by virtue of the broad formulation of the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3(a) of the PPA, which covers \"*[a]ny Dispute arising out of or in connection with [the PPA].\"* The question of whether SCB HK was entitled to step into the shoes of IPTL and assert rights against TANESCO under the PPA is an issue arising in connection with the PPA.\n\n**c) Third issue: did the security interest need to be registered?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAt the time IPTL granted security interests to the Security Agent under the Security Deed, the requirement that certain security interests had to be registered to be perfected was governed by section 79 of Tanzania\u2019s Companies Ordinance:\n\nSubject to the provisions of this Part of this Act, every charge created after the fixed date by a company registered in Tanzania and being a charge to which this section applies shall, so far as any security on the company\u2019s property or undertaking is conferred thereby, be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company, unless the prescribed particulars of the charge, together with the instrument, if any, by which the charge is created or evidenced, or a copy thereof verified in the prescribed manner are delivered to or received by the Registrar for registration in manner required by this Act within forty two days after date of its creation.\n\n(2) This section applies to the following charges \u2014\n\n[...]\n\n(e) a charge on book debts of the company;\n\n(f) a floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company [... ]\n\n[...]149\n\nCLA-10.\n\n155.\n\nThis provision was subsequently replaced on March 1, 2006, by sections 96 and 97 of Tanzania\u2019s Companies Act. There was no change in substance to section 79 of the Companies\u2019 Ordinance.\n\n156.\n\nTANESCO maintains that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed is a charge on book debts and/or a floating charge that was required to be registered under section 79 of the Companies\u2019 Ordinance. SCB HK\u2019s accepts that clause 3.2.1 does amount to a charge insofar as a \"charge\" is defined in section 79(10)(a) of the Companies\u2019 Ordinance to include a \"mortgage.\" It is SCB HK\u2019s position, however, that it is not a charge on book debts or a floating charge and therefore it does not have to be registered under section 79150\n\nCl. Rep., paras. 221-222.\n\n157.\n\nThe security assignment created by clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed grants SCB HK as the Security Agent a bundle of rights in the PPA. TANESCO correctly points out that *\"the bundle of rights represented by the PPA was close to 100% of all the assets of IPTL. It included but was not limited to the right to receive all present and future funds payable to the company.*\"151 The most important right that SCB HK acquired was the right to receive all present and future funds payable to the company. It was not the only right: it has already been noted that one of the rights transferred to SCB HK was the right to invoke the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3 of the PPA. It is, however, the right that is the object of SCB HK\u2019s claim in the present proceedings against TANESCO.\n\nResp. Rej., para. 24.\n\n158.\n\nAs against IPTL, there is no doubt that SCB HK has created a valid security interest. The question is whether that security interest had to be perfected so as to make it effective against third parties. If the security interest created by clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed requires registration pursuant to section 79 of the Companies\u2019 Ordinance, then it will *\"be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company\"* because it is not in dispute that no security interest created by the Security Deed was registered with the Tanzanian authorities.\n\n159.\n\nIt is TANESCO\u2019s primary case that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed creates a charge on future book debts and is therefore registrable under section 79 of the Companies\u2019 Ordinance. SCB HK formulates the two principles governing the analysis of whether the assignment of the PPA amounts to a charge on book debts as follows:\n\n(1) Where the charge is over existing property, it is necessary to look to the nature of the charged property as at the date of creation of the charge. In particular, if the charge relates to an existing contract that, as at that date, does not include a book debt, then the charge is not registrable, even though the contract may ultimately give rise to a book debt in the future.\n\n(2) On the other hand, if, on its proper construction, the charge is granted over future book debts as and when they arise, then the charge will be registrable, notwithstanding that the book debts to which it relates are not yet in existence.152\n\nCl. Rep., para. 224. Elsewhere, SCB HK set out three different categories of charge which reflect these two principles: *see* Cl. PHB, para. 444.\n\n160.\n\nIt is TANESCO\u2019s submission that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed gives rise to a charge on future book debts.153 It is clear from SCB HK\u2019s formulation of its second principle that both Parties accept that a charge on future book debts is registrable. It is SCB HK\u2019s submission, however, that clause 3.2.1 creates a charge that relates to an existing contract that, as of the date of the execution of the Security Deed, does not include a book debt and therefore is not registrable. Thus, according to SCB HK, the present case falls within the first principle set out above and SCB HK relies primarily on the English authority of *Paul & Frank Ltd v. Discount Bank (Overseas) Ltd & the Board of Trade154* in support of this submission.\n\nResp. Rej., para. 25.\n\n[1967] Ch 348.\n\n161.\n\nIn *Paul & Frank,* Paul & Frank Ltd drew a bill of exchange on the buyers of its goods for the price and subsequently delivered the goods. Paul & Frank Ltd completed a letter of authority conferring a power on the Board of Trade to pay any sums becoming due under an insurance policy for the liabilities of foreign buyers of Paul & Frank Ltd\u2019s goods to Discount Bank. The buyer of Paul & Frank Ltd\u2019s goods did not pay for them. The bill of exchange was dishonoured. A liquidator was appointed for Paul & Frank Ltd. The Board of Trade paid sums to Discount Bank under the insurance policy on reliance of the letter of authority. The liquidator sought a declaration that the letter of authority was void as an unregistered charge on a book debt of Paul & Frank Ltd.\n\n162.\n\nProfessor McCormack, SCB HK\u2019s legal expert, places particular importance on the following passage of Pennycuick J\u2019s judgment in that case:\n\nIt seems to me that, in order to ascertain whether any particular charge is a charge on book-debts within the meaning of the section, one must look at the items of property which form the subject matter of the charge at the date of its creation and consider whether any of those items is a book-debt. In the case of an existing item of property, this question can only be answered by reference to its character at the date of creation. Where the item of property is the benefit of a contract and at the date of the charge the benefit of the contract does not comprehend any book-debt, I do not see how that contract can be brought within the section as being a book-debt merely by reason that the contract may ultimately result in a book-debt.155\n\n[1967] Ch 348, 362. Expert Report of Professor Gerard McCormack, para. 38.\n\n163.\n\nThis statement must be read in conjunction with Pennycuick J\u2019s characterisation of the contract of insurance, which was the relevant contract before him, as a \"contingency contract\":\n\nI do not think in ordinary speech one would described as a \"book-debt\" the right under a contingency contract before the contingency happens. By \"contingency contract\" in this connection I mean contracts of insurance, guarantee, indemnity and the like.156\n\n[1967] Ch348, 360.\n\n164.\n\nWhen Pennycuick J spoke of the benefit of the contract *\"not comprehend[ing] any book debt\",* he clearly meant debts of a contingent nature; *viz.* debts the payment of which is contingent on the happening of some uncertain future event. This was the nature of an amount payable under an insurance policy upon the occurrence of the insured event. According to Pennycuick J\u2019s findings in respect of the expert accountancy evidence, such an amount would not even be recorded as a book debt even after the admission of liability under the insurance policy and the ascertainment of the amount.157\n\n[1967] Ch348, 362.\n\n165.\n\nThe contractual payments to be made by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA in this case were not contingent debts akin to debts payable under contracts of insurance, guarantee and indemnity. At the time the Security Deed was executed, they were future debts comprehended by the PPA that would have been entered into the books of IPTL as book debts as they arose.158 Indeed, it can be readily inferred that the lenders made the US$105 million facility loan to IPTL primarily on the back of the capacity payments that were anticipated to be received under the PPA and this is reflected by the very terms of clause 3.2 of the Security Deed.\n\nSCB HK\u2019s expert on accounting practices in Tanzania, Mr. Kassam, accepted that the capacity payments should have been entered into IPTL\u2019s financial statements once the relevant billing period had elapsed following the commencement of commercial operations and were in fact entered on this basis: Mr. Kassam\u2019s Statement, paras. 59 and 68.\n\n166.\n\nThe facts of the present case are also distinguishable from another case cited by SCB HK in support of its argument, the decision of the Irish High Court in *Farrell v. Equity Bank Ltd.159* This case involved an entitlement to refunds of premiums on insurance policies in the event that such policies were cancelled prior to the expiration of their term. It was found by Lynch J that *\"the mere possibility that future refunds of premiums might become payable in amounts that were wholly unascertained and might never arise at the date of the creation of the charge does not make that transaction a book debt which must be registered.\"160*\n\n[1990] 2 IR 549.\n\n[1990] 2 IR 549, 554.\n\n167.\n\nLike *Paul and Frank Ltd,* the *Farrell* case concerned a contingent debt rather than a future debt. The making of contractual payments by TANESCO to IPTL under the terms of the PPA can hardly be described as a \"mere possibility\" and in amounts that \"were wholly unascertained.\" If that were the case, it would have been impossible to obtain financing for the construction of the power plant.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed creates a charge over future book debts and thus had to be registered pursuant to section 79 of Tanzania\u2019s Companies Ordinance. In light of this finding, there is no need for the Tribunal to address TANESCO\u2019s alternative submission that clause 3.2.1 creates a floating charge.\n\n**d) Fourth issue: what are the effects of non-registration?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThere is no doubt that the non-registration of a security interest does not invalidate the charge against the company. According to Professor Goode\u2019s leading treatise *Principles of**Corporate Insolvency Law,* which was quoted by the Tanzanian Court of Appeal in its judgment quashing the liquidation order against IPTL:\n\nIn should be borne in mind that registration is purely a perfection requirement designed to give notice to third parties; it is not a condition of validity of the charge, which remains fully enforceable against the company prior to winding up or administration. It follows that if the company does go into liquidation or administration the consequent avoidance of the unregistered charge has no impact on the charge to the extent that he has already realised his security or perfected it by seizure or judicial foreclosure or has otherwise obtained payment, for to that extent his security has been satisfied and there is nothing for him to enforce.161\n\nCLA-89, pages 609-610.\n\n170.\n\nAs matters stand today, the fact that SCB HK failed to register a charge over future book debts in relation to clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed does not have any effect on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or the relief requested by SCB HK in these proceedings. This is because there is currently no liquidator or administrator appointed in respect of IPTL.\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal nonetheless considers that it would be prudent to rule upon the effect of nonregistration in the event that a liquidator or administrator were appointed in respect of IPTL and the history of these proceedings suggests that the *status quo* is liable to change. This issue has, moreover, been the object of extensive submissions and expert evidence from both Parties.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent has disputed whether the arbitration agreement is severable from those parts of the Security Deed that create a registrable charge in the event that a liquidator or administrator is appointed in respect of IPTL. According to the Respondent: *\"the voiding of the security interest created by the assignment [under Section 3.2] voids all the rights created by the assignment of the arbitration clause, as the assignment was only given for the purposes of security.\"162* The Respondent further submitted that: *\"It is the assignment of the PPA itself, rather than the individual provisions thereof, that requires registration under the laws of Tanzania.\"163*\n\nResp. Rej., para. 71; Resp. PHB, para. 152.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 158.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s arguments on this point.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent referred the Tribunal to *Shinyanga Regional Training Co Ltd & Another v. National Bank of Commerce164* and *Esberger & Son, Ltd v. Capital and Counties Bank165* Neither of these cases, however, assists the Respondent because they relate to the validity of a single security interest. In *Esberger,* a security interest over the title deeds to a parcel of land was deemed to be void because the interest was not registered in due time. There was no issue of severability raised in that case. Likewise, in *Shinyanga,* the issue was simply the validity of an unregistered debenture and the power of sale conferred by that debenture. No issue of severance was raised in that case. The Respondent accepted in oral submissions that there were *\"no cases whatsoever in Tanzania on [the severance point] \"166*\n\n[1997] TLR 78.\n\n[1913] 2 Ch 366.\n\nMr. Range, Tr. March 14, 2013, page 156.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimant has referred the Tribunal to *Re Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd167 and Re North Wales Produce and Supply Society Limited.168*\n\n[1998] Ch 495, CLA-29.\n\n[1922] Ch 340, CLA-90.\n\n176.\n\nIn *Re Cosslett,* a clause in a construction contract allowed the employer, if the contractor abandoned the contract, to (i) use the contractor\u2019s plant and materials to finish the works and (ii) sell the contractor\u2019s plant and materials and apply the proceedings in satisfaction of sums owed to the employer by the contractor. The Court of Appeal held that right (ii) was a registrable charge that was void against the contractor\u2019s administrator for nonregistration. In respect of right (i), however, the Court held that this right was unaffected by its conclusion relating to right (ii).\n\n177.\n\nAlthough the Respondent submitted that *Cosslett* is distinguishable,169 it clearly indicates that the failure to perfect a security interest does not invalidate other parts of the relevant instrument that do not require registration.\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 155-158.\n\n178.\n\nIn *North Wales,* it was stated by the Court that:\n\n[A]n instrument giving a security on several properties is a security for the whole amount on each of those properties and on every part of each of them and [...] the excision of one property in law, by a statute, or, in fact, by an earthquake, effects a separation between the properties and withdraws that one of them from the operation of the instrument, but leaves the instrument intact and still operative as regards the rest.170\n\nCLA-90, page 345.\n\n179.\n\nThe Court went on to say that it did not matter whether or not the items charged were separately described in the instrument.171\n\n*Ibid.,* page 345.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded by these authorities cited by the Claimant that as a matter of law it is possible to sever those security interests that are void for lack of registration from those interests that are not. This conclusion is further supported by the commercial reality underlying the Security Deed, which was to ensure that the lenders had security over all of IPTL\u2019s assets, including any rights or benefits under the PPA. The right to bring arbitration proceedings against TANESCO to enforce its obligations under the PPA is clearly a valuable right that is not subject to registration and can be severed from those interests that do require registration. Furthermore, clause 18 of the Security Deed expressly provides that the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Security Deed shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision. Finally, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is also consistent with the policy underlying the registration of security interests, which is to give notice to third party creditors. There is no reason for third parties to be on notice of other contractual rights such as an agreement to arbitrate. This also militates in favour of severance.\n\n181.\n\nIt follows that if a liquidator or administrator were to be appointed in respect of IPTL in the future, this would have no effect on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction either prospectively or retrospectively. This is because the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3 of the PPA has been legally assigned to SCB HK and that right is severable from the charge on future book debts created by clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed.\n\n182.\n\nThe registration issue is irrelevant for another reason. The Tribunal has concluded elsewhere that, in so far as SCB HK has stepped into the shoes of IPTL in respect of its rights under the PPA, this Tribunal only has jurisdiction in respect of IPTL\u2019s rights against TANESCO under the PPA. As will be discussed later, this means that the Tribunal can make a declaration as to any amounts owed by TANESCO to IPTL, but it cannot make an order requiring TANESCO to pay any such amounts to SCB HK independently of IPTL. SCB HK has no rights as against TANESCO as the lender to IPTL in these arbitration proceedings; it only has rights against TANESCO as the assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA.\n\n183.\n\nIf a liquidator or administrator were to be appointed in respect of IPTL, this would only have an impact in respect of any order of the Tribunal requiring the enforcement of SCB HK\u2019s security interest against IPTL\u2019s assets. But for independent reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that it has no jurisdiction to make such an order in any case. **It follows that the registration issue is irrelevant so long as the Tribunal confines itself to giving declaratory relief, which the Tribunal is obliged to do in the circumstances of this case.**\n\n**e) The fifth issue: Respondent\u2019s request for a stay of proceedings and renewed application for bifurcation**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nAs was previously noted, the Respondent had submitted that, in light of the Tanzania Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment of December 17, 2012,172 section 249(1) of the Companies Act 2002 must be interpreted as proscribing the continuation of these arbitration proceedings by SCB HK while its petition for the appointment of an administrator in respect of IPTL was pending. According to the Respondent:\n\nThe Court\u2019s rationale for applying Section 249(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2002 must also apply to Section 249(1)(b), which prohibits SCB HK from seeking to enforce its security without first obtaining leave of the High Court. By force of logic, the automatic stay contained in Section 249 that required the Court to vacate all orders in the Winding Up Petition prior to 17 September 2009 applies equally to SCB HK and its actions related to this arbitration. Since filing the Second Administration Petition on 17 September 2009, SCB HK lost whatever right and authority it might have had to seek to enforce its security without obtaining prior leave of the High Court. As SCB HK has never requested nor been granted leave, SCB HK could not and has not lawfully invoked the arbitration clause in Article 18.3 of the PPA as required for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.173\n\n*See supra* para. 79.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Renewed Application, para. 22.\n\n185.\n\nSection 249(1) of the Companies Act 2002 reads:\n\n(1) During the period beginning with the presentation of a petition for an administration order and ending with the making of such an order or the dismissal of the petition-\n\n(a) no resolution may be passed or order made for the winding up of the company;\n\n(b) no steps may be taken to enforce any security over the company\u2019s property or to repossess goods in the company\u2019s possession under any hire-purchase agreement, except with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose; and\n\n(c) no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process may be commenced or continued, and no distress may be levied, against the company or its property except with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as aforesaid.174\n\nRA-59.\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002 in its Renewed Application. The Respondent maintains that the present arbitration amounts to taking steps to enforce SCB HK\u2019s security, which the Respondent quotes Professor Goode as meaning *\"a mortgagee or chargee of book debts or other receivables who without the consent of the administrator or leave of the court collects or demands payment from the account debtors is taking steps to enforce security over the company\u2019s property in breach of the prohibition.\"175*\n\nRA-71.\n\n187.\n\nAs the Tribunal has already clarified, it does not have jurisdiction to order TANESCO to pay to SCB HK sums owed to IPTL. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to giving declaratory relief, *viz.* to quantify TANESCO\u2019s outstanding debt to IPTL. The present proceedings do not, therefore, constitute a *\"step to enforce any security over [IPTL\u2019s] property\"* for the purposes of section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002. The fact that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction has been vested by way of a security assignment is also irrelevant: the assignment has already been executed and hence there is nothing to enforce in respect of SCB HK\u2019s right to invoke the arbitration agreement in the PPA.\n\n188.\n\nThere is also a more fundamental reason for rejecting the application of section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002: it is a procedural rule in a Tanzanian statute and thus has no application in an ICSID arbitration governed by the ICSID Convention and international law. Section 249(1)(b) is part of the *lex fori* in Tanzania and thus would be applicable in respect of any court proceedings in Tanzania. But the procedural law of this arbitration is not the law of Tanzania and hence section 249(1)(b) does not apply to these proceedings. The Respondent has conflated the law applicable to the merits of the claims in this arbitration and the law applicable to the procedure. For instance, in its \"Reply in Support of its Renewed Application for Bifurcation or Stay\", the Respondent wrote: *\"TANESCO only asks the Tribunal to abide by Tanzanian law which it is required to apply under the PPA.\"176* But the choice of Tanzanian law in clause 19.4 of the PPA relates to the law applicable to the PPA as a contract and not to the procedural law of this arbitration, which comprises the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules pursuant to clause 18.3 of the PPA.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply in Support of its Renewed Application for Bifurcation or Stay, para. 30.\n\n189.\n\nNeither party has referred to Tanzanian authorities as to whether section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002 is a procedural or substantive rule. The Claimant has instead referred to English authorities in respect of the proper characterization of the same rule in the English insolvency statute. In *Barclays Mercantile v. Sibec LTD,*177 Millett J had to interpret the effect of section 11(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986, which read:\n\nDuring the period for which an administration order is in force [...] *(c)* no other steps may be taken to enforce any security over the company's property, or to repossess goods in the company's possession under any hire-purchase agreement, except with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the court and subject (where the court gives leave) to such terms as the court may impose; and *(d)* no other proceedings and no execution or other legal process may be commenced or continued, and no distress may be levied, against the company or its property except with the consent of the administrator or the leave of the court and subject (where the court gives leave) to such terms as aforesaid.\n\nMillett J noted that this section *\"is couched in purely procedural terms'\"* and thus could not alter the parties\u2019 substantive rights.178 The Tribunal is persuaded that section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002 in Tanzania should be characterised in precisely the same way.\n\n[1992] 1 WLR 1253. CLA-81.\n\n*Barclays Mercantile v. Sibec LTD* [1992] 1 WLR 1253, 1257. CLA-81.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, as a procedural provision, section 249(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2002 only applies where Tanzanian law is the *lex fori* for the legal proceedings in question. That is not the case in respect of the present ICSID arbitration proceedings. For these reasons, the Tribunal was not prepared to accede to the Respondent\u2019s request to stay the proceedings or change its position that the proceedings should not be bifurcated.\n\n191.\n\nIn the light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that there has been a valid statutory assignment of IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA to SCB HK, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute, that clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed creates a charge over future book debts and thus had to be registered pursuant to section 79 of Tanzania\u2019s Companies Ordinance, that the arbitration agreement in clause 18.3 of the PPA was severable of the charge on future book debts, and therefore did not need to be registered, that the registration issue is irrelevant so long as the Tribunal confines itself to giving declaratory relief, and that there is no basis for staying the proceedings or for bifurcation of the proceedings in this case.\n\n**VII. Positions of the Parties on the Merits**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review the positions of the Parties on the merits, dealing first with the claims made by each Party and then with the arguments of the Parties on the scope of the award, the Debt/Equity dispute and the quantum of any award. In doing so, the Tribunal would observe that this task has been complicated by the fact that the Parties\u2019 positions have changed on numerous occasions throughout the proceedings.\n\n**A. The claims of the Parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. The position of the Claimant**\n-----------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant requested, first, a declaration that *\"since January 2007, TANESCO has breached its obligation to pay the Capacity Payments, Energy Payments, Supplemental Charges, Bonus Payments and Interest Payments arising under the PPA [...]*\"179 It requested, second, a declaration that TANESCO *\"is required to pay the approximately US$225 million in outstanding invoices [...] together with any sums due under invoices that have not been disclosed to SCB HK.\"180* The Claimant requested, third, an order *\"that out of the sum outstanding under the PPA, TANESCO shall pay to SCB HK an amount sufficient to discharge SCB HK\u2019s loan to IPTL in full on the date of discharge, including interest and penalties.\"181* It indicated that, at the date of the Memorial, this required a payment of US$130,062,332.50.182 And, the Claimant requested, fourth, an order *\"that TANESCO pay the cost of these arbitration proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and costs of legal representation and interest thereon.\"183*\n\nCl. Mem., para. 235, sub-para. (1).\n\n*Ibid.,* sub-para. (2).\n\n*Ibid.,* sub-para. (3).\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Ibid.,* sub-para. (4).\n\n194.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant reiterated the requests made in its Memorial, but changed the amount for which a declaration was requested under the second request from US$225 million to US$258 million, and the amount for which it requested an order under the third request from US$130,062,332.50 to US$133,854,986.59.\n\n195.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant set forth a more comprehensive list of requests for relief as follows:184\n\n(1) A declaration that shareholder loans qualify as equity for the purposes of the 31 May 1995 Letter, and that no change to the reference tariff is required;\n\n(2) A declaration that, since January 2007, Tanesco has breached its obligation to pay the Capacity Payments, Energy Payments, Supplemental Charges, Bonus Payments and Interest Payments arising under the PPA (calculated in accordance with the PPA, the ICSID Award and the Implementation Model);\n\n(3) **A declaration** that Tanesco is liable to pay the **Bonus Payments** claimed by SCB HK in its Memorial;\n\n(4) **A declaration** that Tanesco is liable to pay, as damages, the **exchange rate losses** arising from its failure to pay the Capacity Payments, Energy Payments, Supplemental Charges, Bonus Payments and Interest Payments in accordance with the PPA;\n\n(5) A declaration that SCB HK is entitled to recover the **amounts paid by Tanesco to the Provisional Liquidator or Liquidator** under the Interim PPA;\n\n(6) **A declaration** that, **as a result of these breaches,** Tanesco is liable to pay SCB HK either:\n\n(a) **US$258.7 million,185** made up of outstanding invoices, interest on outstanding invoices, and damages resulting from Tanesco\u2019s failure to pay invoices rendered to it in accordance with the requirements of the PPA, together with any sums due under invoices that have not been disclosed to SCB HK or fell due after the date of SCB HK\u2019s Reply Memorial, and any further damages resulting from Tanesco\u2019s ongoing delay in paying outstanding invoices; **or**\n\n(b) at least a sum in excess of the amount calculated by SCB HK as sufficient to discharge SCB HK\u2019s loan to IPTL in full on the date of discharge;\n\n(7) **An order** that out of the sum Tanesco is liable to pay SCB HK under the PPA, Tanesco shall pay to SCB HK an amount calculated by SCB HK as sufficient to discharge SCB HK\u2019s loan to IPTL in full on the date of discharge, including interest and penalties (as at 31 January 2013, this would require a payment of US$ **138,726,761.95);** and\n\n(8) **An order** that Tanesco pay the cost of these arbitration proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and costs of legal representation and interest thereon, to the extent that these have not been included as enforcement costs in the sum calculated by SCB HK as sufficient to discharge SCB HK\u2019s loan to IPTL, referred to in paragraph 611 (7). (Emphasis added)\n\nCl. PHB, para. 611.\n\nCalculated as of September 2012, Tr. March 14, 2013, page 6, line 20.\n\n196.\n\nThus, in its PHB, the amount for which a declaration was sought had changed from the US$258 million requested in the Counter-Memorial to US$258.7 million, and the amount for which an order had been sought in the Counter-Memorial of US$133,854,986.59 had changed to US$ 138,726,761.95.\n\n197.\n\nAs pointed out in sub-para. 7 of para. 611 of the Claimant\u2019s PHB, and as had been noted in its Memorial and Reply, the amount requested, was *\"an amount calculated by SCB HK.\"* It was not an amount the Tribunal was asked to verify. Perhaps anticipating that the Tribunal might have some reservations about ordering an amount whose accuracy it was not able to confirm, the Claimant stated in its PHB, but not in its prayer for relief:\n\nIn the alternative, if the Tribunal considers that it cannot order that Tanesco pay to SCB HK the amount SCB HK calculates as due under the Facility Agreement, even though such sum is less than the full amount the Tribunal concludes is owed by Tanesco under the PPA, then **SCB HK requests that the Tribunal instead order Tanesco to pay SCB HK the full amount outstanding under the PPA.** SCB HK will then account for any balance in excess of the amount outstanding under the senior debt to IPTL.186\n\nCl. PHB, para. 515.\n\n198.\n\nFurthermore, in its PHB, the Claimant provided various options for the Tribunal in dealing with the quantum of the amount for which it claimed a declaration as owing under the PPA. First, the Tribunal could determine the amount owing and make a declaration accordingly and make an order as to the payment of the amount IPTL owed SCB HK as calculated by SCB HK.187 Second, if it could not make a determination of a specific amount owing under the PPA, it could instead declare that it was in any event in excess of the amount IPTL owed SCB HK as calculated by SCB HK, and order the payment of this latter amount.188 Third, if the Tribunal was unable to determine that the amount owing SCB HK under the PPA was greater than the amount IPTL owed SCB HK as calculated by SCB HK, then it is suggested that the Tribunal issues *\"an interim Order determining the points of principle at issue between the parties, and instructs the parties to seek to resolve the amounts due, either by negotiation between the parties or, failing agreement, further application to the Tribunal.\"189*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 516, Scenario 1.\n\n*Ibid.,* Scenario 2.\n\n*Ibid.,* Scenario 3.\n\n199.\n\nIn short, in its prayer for relief and in the body of its PHB, the Claimant offered the Tribunal a veritable smorgasbord of options.\n\n**2. The position of the Respondent**\n-------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to reject the Claimant\u2019s claim for damages.190 It based this on a variety of grounds, including that the IPTL had financed its 30% equity contribution not by paid up share capital but by debt,191 that the claim was in part based on \"unexplained and undocumented\" enforcement costs,192 that the \"interim fees\" claimed by the Claimant had already been paid,193 that contrary to the Claimant\u2019s position the Respondent is entitled to exercise a right of set-off,194 that the Claimant had incorrectly converted the claim from Tanzanian shillings into US dollars at historical rates rather than present exchange rates,195 that the Claimant was not eligible to receive bonus payments,196 and that the Claimant had diverted funds that should properly have been used to pay down the senior debt to unsecured creditors Wartsila and Mechmar.197 Finally, the Respondent argued that the Claimant could not demand tariff payments for the period after it claimed that the Government of Tanzania had expropriated the Tegeta plant.198\n\nResp. CM, para. 259.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 58-95.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 95-98.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 98-99.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 99-100.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 100-101.\n\n*Ibid.,* page 102.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 102-105.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 105-106.\n\n201.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent claimed in its Counter-Memorial that since the tariff had been based on an assumption of a 30% equity contribution by IPTL, the tariff had to be recalculated to reflect the fact that the 30% had been constituted by a shareholder loan not by a contribution of share capital. In the Respondent\u2019s view, equity could only mean paid up share capital.199\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 247-258.\n\n202.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Responder took a slightly different approach, requesting the Tribunal to reject the Claimant\u2019s request for declaratory relief and to determine the amounts owing under the PPA up to October 2009 when the Claimant alleged that the plant was expropriated. The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal deny any other relief claimed by SCB HK and order SCB HK to pay the costs of the arbitration.200 Although it did not explicitly do so in its request for relief, in the body of its Rejoinder the Respondent reiterated its alternative argument that the PPA should be rectified to reflect the fact that there had been no 30% equity contribution.201\n\nResp. Rej., para. 219.\n\n*Ibid.,* pages 66-83.\n\n203.\n\nIn its PHB, the Respondent took a position closer to that set out in its Counter-Memorial. First, it requested the Tribunal to reject all of the Claimant\u2019s requests for relief. Second, it asked the Tribunal to declare that the failure of IPTL to disclose that it had not contributed 30% equity, or to adjust the tariff calculation to reflect that the 30% contribution was by way of debt, constituted a breach of the PPA. Third, it requested the Tribunal to dismiss all of SCB HK\u2019s claims on the merits, or in the alternative *\"require the parties to recalculate and determine any amounts due pursuant to the principles set forth in TANESCO\u2019s submissions\"202*\n\nResp. PHB, para. 343, sub-para. (c).\n\n**B. The Debt/Equity issue**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. The position of the Claimant**\n-----------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the concept of \"equity\" was never defined by the parties.203 It appeared in the May 31, 1995 letter of Mr. Rugemalira and thus was a term that originated with IPTL. The meaning of the term \"equity\" had to be understood in terms of what the parties themselves took it to mean and what it would be understood to mean in project finance.204 In this regard, the Claimant argued that IPTL, including Mr. Rugemalira, the lenders, and TANESCO itself, all were aware that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was to be financed by a shareholder loan, and that shareholder loans are widely accepted in project finance to constitute equity.\n\nTr. December 3, 2012, page 83, lines 20-21.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 14\n\n205.\n\nIn respect of Mr. Rugemalira, the Claimant relied on documents that he was aware of, communications by him and his attendance at the ICSID 1 hearings.205 In addition, the Claimant argued that IPTL and its shareholders, VIP and Mechmar, were aware of the shareholder loan, referring *inter alia* to the shareholder agreement between IPTL and Mechmar, IPTL\u2019s memorandum and articles of association, the shareholder loan itself, the drawdown notices for the loan facility and IPTL\u2019s accounts for 1997 and 1998.206 In addition, the financing documents made the lenders aware of the shareholder loan and these were again documents that IPTL\u2019s shareholders were also aware of.207\n\nCl. Rep., para. 111.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 112. *See also,* Cl. PHB, paras. 122 and seq.. paras. 178 and seq.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 113.\n\n206.\n\nTANESCO\u2019s understanding that the equity contribution was to be by way of shareholder loan is said by the Claimant to be based on TANESCO\u2019s awareness of relevant documents, including the 1998 Financial Model, the Facility Agreement, the Shareholder Support Deed and IPTL\u2019s accounts for 1997 and 1998.208 The Claimant also relies on what TANESCO would have known from its participation in the ICSID 1 proceedings, its communications with the GoT and the knowledge of the GoT through Mr. Rutabanzibwa.209 In sum, the Claimant argues that TANESCO fully understood that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was being made by way of shareholder loan and only in 2007 put forward the argument that it did not in order to oppose without valid reasons the payments of invoices.210\n\n*Ib id.,* para. 114. *See also,* Cl. PHB, paras. 191 and seq.\n\nCl. Rep., paras. 115-119. Mr. Rutabanzibwa was Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of the Government of Tanzania at the time of the conclusion of the PPA.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 126.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant also relied on the expert reports of Colin Johnson and Asif Kassam to show that *\"a shareholder loan would be considered to be shareholders\u2019 equity for the purposes of the debt to equity ratio in the context of standard project financing transactions entered into at the time.\"211*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 121.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant also took the view that even if the PPA did not reflect the common intention of the parties with respect to the Debt/Equity issue, there was no mechanism under English law for the Tribunal to rectify the agreement for common mistake,212 and the requirements for rectification in the case of unilateral mistake have not been met.213\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 139.\n\n*lbid.,* paras. 140-148.\n\n209.\n\nFinally, the Claimant took the view that even if the Tribunal disagreed with it on the equity issue, there was no need for the tariff to be recalculated and the IRR should remain at 22.31%.214 In this regard, the Claimant disputed the calculations for an adjusted tariff offered by the Respondent\u2019s expert David Ehrhardt,215 relying instead on the report of its own expert Colin Johnston.216\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 284 and *seq.*\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 309 and *seq.*\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 293 and *seq.*\n\n210.\n\nDuring the hearing of March 15, 2013, the Claimant took the view that if the Tribunal did decide that there had to be an adjustment to the tariff, then the Parties should be given a time-limited opportunity to work out the modalities of any such adjustment.217\n\nTr. March 15, 2013, page 82, line 21, page 83, lines 1-15.\n\n**2. The position of the Respondent**\n-------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that IPTL falsely informed TANESCO that there was to be a 30% equity contribution, in order to induce it to enter into the PPA.218 Instead of an equity contribution, however, IPTL funded its 30% contribution by a shareholder loan and failed to inform TANESCO of this.219 Yet, a shareholder loan was not understood, nor would it have been understood in Tanzania or internationally, as an equity contribution.220 In this regard, the Respondent relied on the declaration of Leonard Mususa and the expert report of David Ehrhardt.221\n\nResp. CM, para. 159.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 162.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 163-164.\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that the tariff calculation was based on an assumption that the equity contribution would be true equity and not a shareholder loan.222 In its view, the model on which the tariff was calculated assumed that the 22.31% IRR would be achieved through dividends payable over 20 years and a release of accumulated \"trapped cash\" at the end of that 20 year period.223 Relying on the expert report of David Ehrhardt, the Respondent argued that the models would have provided an entirely different payment schedule if the 30% equity contribution had been substituted by a shareholder loan.224 The effect of using a shareholder loan, according to the Respondent, was to increase the IRR beyond the agreed rate of return of 22.31%.225\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 168 and *seq.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 170 b.\n\n*lb id.,* para. 171.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 181 and *seq.*\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent rejected the arguments of the Claimant that TANESCO was aware that IPTL was substituting a shareholder loan for its 30% equity contribution. It was not provided for in the May 31, 1995 Rugemalira letter, nor do the documents relied on by the Claimant to show knowledge of both Mr. Rugemalira and of TANESCO constitute notice to TANESCO of the shareholder loan.226 In particular, the 1997 Loan Facility Agreement and the Shareholder Support Deed were not documents to which TANESCO was a party.227 The Respondent denies that there is a \"common practice\" under which shareholder loans are treated as a substitute for equity,228 and SCB HK\u2019s claim that TANESCO had knowledge that a shareholder loan was to be used is \"misplaced and misleading.\"229\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 184-193.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 194-200.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 201-203.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 204-210.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent further argued, in the alternative, that the PPA should be rectified to calculate the tariff based on a shareholder loan rather than 30% equity, arguing that under English law rectification could be done on the basis of either common or unilateral mistake.230 In the view of the Respondent, it was for the Tribunal to decide whether the agreement between IPTL and TANESCO required a downward adjustment to the tariff and the capacity charges to reflect the substantial costs savings IPTL gained by using debt in lieu of equity.231\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 247-258.\n\nResp. PHB, para. 160.\n\n215.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent argued, the IRR had not been correctly calculated based on the use of a shareholder loan.232*\"In TANESCO\u2019s view, whether the model accurately calculates the tariff is the ultimate test\"233* In order to calculate an accurate IRR, subordinate debt has to be shown in the model separately and calculated separately from true equity.234\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 13.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 14.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n216.\n\nBased on the expert report of David Ehrhardt, the Respondent offered various approaches to recalculating the tariff:\n\n\u2022 The IRR could be calculated by reference to Mechmar\u2019s actual costs of capitalization for providing the shareholder loan (Malaysian Interbank rate (KLIBOR) plus 2.5% from January 1997 to April 2003 and 2% thereafter).235\n\n\u2022 The IRR could be calculated on the basis of a post-tax interest rate of 16% that Mechmar would have received had it contributed 30% true equity in the project as calculated by TANESCO\u2019s expert.236 Applying the latter rate, the unpaid capacity charges for the period through October 2009 would be totaling 96.3 billion Tanzanian shillings as opposed to the 130.5 billion SCB HK is claiming.237\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 236.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 237.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 237.\n\n217.\n\nThe IRR could also provide the same 22.31% rate of return on the shareholder loan that IPTL received, which would result in unpaid capacity charges of 118.2 billion of Tanzanian shillings.238\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 239.\n\n218.\n\nHowever, the Respondent noted that the various options took into account only unpaid capacity charges to October 2009, and did not reflect any offsets or other factors that might be taken into account in determining the amount owing.239 In the end, the Respondent took the view that if the Tribunal concluded that there had to be an adjustment to the tariff, it would need to come back to the Parties to let them try to work out what that tariff adjustment should be.240\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 239.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 238, line 25, page 239, lines 1-2; *see also* Tr. March 15, 2013, page 81, lines 17-24.\n\n**C. The question of quantum**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. The position of the Claimant**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a) The \"Disallowed Costs\" issue**\n-----------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the fact that certain costs had been \"disallowed\" by the ICSID 1 tribunal did not mean that IPTL was relieved of its obligation to pay those costs.241 The costs had not been included in the calculation of the tariff, which was intended to reflect the costs that were allowed and not the reality of IPTL\u2019s actual debt obligations. Furthermore, the restructuring entered into between IPTL and its creditors, which was done to ensure that commercial operation could be achieved,242 was not secret and was fully known to TANESCO.243 In its PHB, the Claimant argued that the effect of its paying to its senior lenders and contractor the \"disallowed costs\" was not that TANESCO paid more, but that IPTL\u2019s shareholders received less.244\n\nCl. Rep., paras. 68 and *seq.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 90.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 98.\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 374 and *seq.*\n\n**b) Exchange rate losses**\n---------------------------\n\n220.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant calculated the total amount owing on the basis of the US dollar value of the claim at the date that the unpaid invoices were issued.245 In its Reply, the Claimant explained that historical rates were appropriate because under the Calculations and Forecasting Agreement it had reached with its lenders it was required to convert the moneys received by it into US dollars within two business days of receipt,246 and this, the Claimant argues, was known to the Respondent. Furthermore, under the ICSID award model, it was clear that IPTL\u2019s loans would be paid off in US dollars.247 Thus, losses resulting from the inability to convert to US dollars were \"foreseeable exchange rate losses.\"248\n\nCl. Mem., Appendix I.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 293.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 295.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 296.\n\n221.\n\nIn its PHB, the Claimant argued that although the evidence was limited, it was very likely, \"on a balance of probabilities\", that if TANESCO had paid the tariff promptly, IPTL would have converted the payments into US dollars.249 The Claimant argued that, under English law, the \"exchange rate losses\" were not too remote because they fell under the first limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale,* that is losses *\"arising naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things from [the] breach of contract itself.\"250* On that basis, the Claimant argued, Article 17.1 of the PPA did not apply because it covered only indirect or consequential loss, which is loss that falls under the second limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale,251*\n\nCl. PHB, para. 541.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 554(1)(a).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 565.\n\n**c) Bonus, supplementary and interest payments**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant argued that there were undisputed bonus payments, supplementary payments and interest payments outstanding.252 These amounted to US$34,295,038.64.253 In its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant argued that IPTL should not be denied the opportunity to receive bonus payments from the fact that the plant had been put in \"non-dispatch mode\" as a result of TANESCO\u2019s failure to make the tariff payments.254 In its PHB, the Claimant further argued that bonus payments did not constitute \"consequential\" loss and thus were not barred by Article 17.1 of the PPA. The fact that bonus payments were owed, the Claimant argued, is confirmed by the fact that invoices were issued for bonus payments in 2007 and 2008 that were undisputed. The Claimant also makes a claim for bonus payments based on three other invoices issued in 2009, 2010 and 2011.255\n\nCl. Mem., para. 174.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 198.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 299.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 595.\n\n**d) Enforcement costs**\n------------------------\n\n223.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant argued that under the terms of the Facility Agreement it is entitled to claim enforcement costs incurred to protect its rights under the financing agreements.256 TANESCO, it argued, is not a party to the Facility Agreement and thus SCB HK does not have to provide any proof of those costs to TANESCO.257 Further, in its oral argument, the Claimant also stated that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider the correctness of amounts claimed under the Facility Agreement.258\n\nCl. Rep., para. 336.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 338.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 14, lines 9-10.\n\n**e) Payments made to the Provisional Liquidator**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant argued that TANESCO was not entitled to deduct from the capacity charges owing to IPTL, amounts paid to the PL under the Interim PPA entered into with the PL.259 In its Reply, the Claimant reiterated that TANESCO was fully aware of SCB HK\u2019s rights under the PPA, and payments made under a different agreement, the Interim PPA, to which SCB HK was not a party, could not diminish SCB HK\u2019s rights under the PPA.260\n\nCl. Mem., paras. 193-197.\n\nCl. Rep., paras. 303-306; *see also* Cl. PHB, paras. 596-599.\n\n**2. The position of the Respondent**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a) The \"Disallowed Costs\" issue**\n-----------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that IPTL and SCB HK had improperly diverted capacity payments made by TANESCO to unsecured creditors Wartsila and Mechmar under a restructuring of its loans that had not been disclosed to TANESCO.261 As a result, costs that had been disallowed by the ICSID 1 tribunal in the calculation of the capacity payments were now being paid out of those capacity payments. Hence, the Respondent argued, these amounts should be offset against SCB HK\u2019s damages claim.262 According to calculations made by the expert David Ehrhardt, the payment by IPTL of these \"disallowed costs\" had the effect of increasing the liability of TANESCO by US$82.9 million dollars.263\n\nResp. CM, paras. 235-236.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 241.\n\n*Id.*\n\n226.\n\nIn its PHB, the Respondent argued that the secret restructuring and the making of payments of the \"disallowed costs\" constituted *\"breaches of IPTL\u2019s contractual obligations to TANESCO under Addendum 1 to the PPA and the PPA\u2019s incorporated financial model\"264* According to the Respondent, this had the effect of negating the ICSID 1 award and disadvantaging the GoT, which in the event of expropriation would have to pay a much larger outstanding balance on the senior debt.265\n\nResp. PHB, para. 266.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 267-268.\n\n**b) Exchange rate losses**\n---------------------------\n\n227.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that the Claimant had wrongfully converted the invoice amounts at historical exchange rates, rather than at the rate applying at the date of the claim. The amounts owing under the PPA, the Respondent argued, were to be paid in Tanzanian shillings,266 and thus any conversion that was to take place had to occur at the time of the claim, not at the time of the invoice.267 The effect of using historical rates, according to expert David Ehrhardt, was to inflate the amount claimed by the Claimant by $38.7 million.268\n\nArt. 6.10 of the PPA provides: *\"Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, (i) all payments to be made by either Party under this Agreement shall be made in lawful currency of the United Republic of Tanzania, and (ii) any payment that becomes due and payable on a day that is other than a Business Day shall be paid on the succeeding Business Day.\"*\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 226-229.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 231 ; Expert Report of David Ehrhardt, paras. 58-63.\n\n228.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent rejects the view that the Calculations and Forecasting Agreement, to which it was not a party, or that the ICSID award model, whose final output was based on the payment of invoices in Tanzanian shillings, could affect the obligation under the PPA to make payments in Tanzanian shillings.269 The Respondent further argued that the \"exchange rate losses\" were consequential losses, which could not be recovered because of Article 17.1 of the PPA.270 In addition, the Respondent argued that recovery for exchange rate losses was not a risk that TANESCO had assumed, and it was never clear to TANESCO that the monies received by IPTL would be used for the paying down of debt.271\n\nResp. Rej, paras. 188-191.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 197; Resp. PHB, para. 259.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 205-208; Resp. PHB, para. 248 and paras. 261-262.\n\n**c) Bonus, supplementary and interest payments**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that the Claimant was not entitled to bonus payments since during the relevant period the plant was in \"non-dispatch\" mode and thus no bonus payments could be generated.272 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent further argued that the Claimant had not proved that it would have been entitled to bonus payments and that in any event such losses would come up against the bar in Article 17.1 of the PPA to the recovery of consequential losses.273 During the hearing, the Respondent clarified that it did not dispute that bonus payments claimed during the period of the PL were recoverable; it disputed only bonus payments claimed for the period that the plant was in \"non-dispatch\" mode.274\n\nResp. CM, para. 233; *see also* Resp. PHB paras. 324-329.\n\nResp. Rej., paras. 209-210.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 262, lines 5-11.\n\n**d) Enforcement costs**\n------------------------\n\n230.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that the Claimant had provided no proof of these claims and in any event they were incurred in different legal proceedings.275 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent reiterated that the Claimant had failed to provide any documentation of its alleged enforcement costs.276\n\nResp. CM, paras. 211-219.\n\nResp. Rej., paras. 215-217; *see also* Resp. PHB, paras. 314-317.\n\n**e) Payments made to the Provisional Liquidator**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that SCB HK was not entitled to include in its claim the fees it had already paid to the PL, as these fees were the cost of running the facility.277 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent reiterated that payments were always made to IPTL and thus when it was in liquidation payments went to the PL.278\n\nResp. CM, paras. 220-222.\n\nResp. Rej., para. 213. *See also* Resp. PHB, paras. 318-320.\n\n**VIII. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Merits**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The issues presented**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. The scope of any award/decision**\n--------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThere are two aspects to the question of scope. First, since the Claimant has requested both declarations of amounts owing and the award of specific sums, assuming the Tribunal were to decide in favour of the Claimant on the merits, and in light of the past and potential future proceedings in the Tanzanian courts relating to the winding up of IPTL, does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to make the declarations and the awards requested? Second, the Respondent has argued that any award should be limited to the period ending October 2009, the date when SCB HK is alleged to have claimed that the Tegeta plant was expropriated. Is, then, the application of any award or declaration that the Tribunal makes to be limited to the period up to October 2009?\n\n**2. The Debt/Equity issue**\n----------------------------\n\n233.\n\nDid the assumption of a 30% equity contribution in the letter of May 31, 1995, which the ICSID 1 tribunal incorporated into the contract between IPTL and TANESCO, include the possibility that this contribution might be by way of a shareholder loan? If not, should the tariff be recalculated on the basis of a shareholder loan instead of a 30% contribution by way of paid up share capital? If such a recalculation is to be undertaken, what are the modalities for doing it?\n\n**3. The question of quantum**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) The \"Disallowed Costs\" issue**\n-----------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nWas the restructuring of the loan between IPTL and its senior lenders, and the repayments to Wartsila and Mechmar in respect of unsecured debt, a breach of IPTL\u2019s obligations under the PPA and its financial model? Does TANESCO suffer any loss from the delay in paying down the senior debt that would warrant a reduction in the damages claimed by SCB HK?\n\n**b) Exchange rate losses**\n---------------------------\n\n235.\n\nWere the losses resulting from the inability of IPTL to exchange the monies it would have received from TANESCO\u2019s unpaid invoices into US dollars \"foreseeable\" losses within the meaning of *Hadley v. Baxendale* or were they losses whose risk was assumed by IPTL and not by TANESCO? Even if such losses were \"foreseeable\" losses, would Article 17.1 of the PPA bar their recovery?\n\n**c) Bonus, supplementary and interest payments**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nAre bonus payments payable for the period the plant was in \"non-dispatch\" mode?\n\n**d) Enforcement costs**\n------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAre the Claimant\u2019s \"enforcement costs\", claimed pursuant to Article 24 of the Facility Agreement, recoverable?\n\n**e) Payments made to the Provisional Liquidator**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nCan SCB HK include in its claim amounts already paid to the PL?\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. The scope of any award/decision**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**a) Can the Tribunal order the payment of a specific sum, or is it limited to making a declaration?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal can make both a declaration of the amount owing under the PPA and an order that the Respondent pay that amount or, as is the Claimant\u2019s preference, make an order for the amount owing from IPTL to SCB HK. While the Tribunal accepts that it is able to make a declaration of the amount owing under the PPA to IPTL in whose shoes SCB HK stands, it does not have jurisdiction to make the other declarations or orders that the Claimant requests.\n\n240.\n\nIn Section VI. B above, the Tribunal concluded that there was a valid statutory assignment of IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA to SCB HK and that therefore the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claim of SCB HK against TANESCO without joining IPTL. The Tribunal also concluded that in accordance with Tanzanian law the security interest held by SCB HK had to be registered and that the consequences of non-registration was a matter to be determined by Tanzanian law. However, if the Tribunal restricts itself to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA and not making any order for payment of monies, then it leaves open the question of priority amongst creditors.\n\n241.\n\nThe potential appointment of a liquidator and the resumption of proceedings in Tanzania for the winding up of IPTL would have consequences for any order that might be made by this Tribunal. An order by the Tribunal that TANESCO pay a specific sum to SCB HK, which would be enforceable in domestic courts, would potentially interfere with the question of priority amongst creditors, which is a matter for a liquidator and Tanzanian courts to decide. By contrast, a declaration that TANESCO owes a specific sum under the PPA leaves to the Tanzanian courts any question of priority amongst creditors.\n\n242.\n\nThis limitation on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal applies whether the Tribunal were to make an order for the full amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK as the assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights or whether it were to make an order for an amount equivalent to the sum needed to discharge IPTL\u2019s obligations to SCB HK. In either case, an order by this Tribunal for the payment of a specific amount potentially encroaches on the power of the Tanzanian courts to determine priority amongst IPTL\u2019s creditors.\n\n243.\n\nThere are, however, further reasons why the Tribunal is unable to make an award of an amount owing sufficient to discharge the debt of IPTL to SCB HK. In its PHB, the Claimant identifies this sum as US$138,726,761.95, but nowhere in its pleadings does it indicate how this amount is arrived at. Indeed, the Claimant states expressly that it is *\"an amount calculated by SCB HK\"* and that any disputes between IPTL and SCB HK on the amount owing to SCB HK by IPTL are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.279 Thus, the Tribunal is asked to make an award of an amount that SCB HK claims is accurate but has not been put to the methods of proof that are normally undertaken before a tribunal makes an order.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 317.\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL which arises under the Facility Agreement. For this very reason, the Tribunal cannot take into account what SCB HK says is the amount owing under the Facility Agreement in the framework of the calculation of the debt owed by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA. In light of this, the Tribunal is not in a position to make an order determining what amount is allegedly owed by IPTL to SCB HK, or even make a determination of what that amount should be and issue a declaration. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over TANESCO and SCB HK as the assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights by virtue of the PPA. It does not have jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL. The sole Parties before the Tribunal are SCB HK, as the assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights, and TANESCO, and thus the Tribunal is in a position to determine only the rights as between those Parties.\n\n245.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the only relief it is in a position to provide in these proceedings is a declaration of any amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL to which SCB HK has a claim as assignee of all of IPTL\u2019s rights.\n\n**b) Is any declaration made the Tribunal to be limited to the period up to October 2009?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant has calculated an amount owing under the PPA from the alleged date of breach of the PPA by TANESCO to the date of the last unpaid invoice.280 The Respondent argues, however, that since SCB HK has alleged that the plant was expropriated in October 2009, it could only claim for any breach of the PPA up to that date.281\n\nCl. Mem., para. 235(2).\n\nResp. Rej., para. 219(2).\n\n247.\n\nThe issue of expropriation is a matter between SCB HK and the GoT, not between SCB HK and TANESCO, and it has been the subject of a separate ICSID arbitration between SCB and the Government of Tanzania.282 The GoT is not a party to the present arbitration nor has the question of expropriation been placed before this Tribunal. Thus, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether and at what date any expropriation might have taken place or fix a date for the determination of loss relying on an expropriation date as the effective date for limiting any damages claim for breach of the PPA.\n\n*Supra* para. 51.\n\n248.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is able to determine whether there has been a breach of the PPA and what loss flows from that breach. And, the loss it can determine includes all losses resulting from that breach. It cannot fix a limit on those losses on the basis of an expropriation claim that has not been placed before it and it is not in a position to decide. Any claim that the acts of a third party have the effect of suspending either IPTL or TANESCO\u2019s obligation to perform the PPA would have to be made on the basis of the PPA itself; in other words, it would have to be pleaded on the basis of an express contractual term (such as a force majeure clause) or an equivalent doctrine under the applicable law of the PPA. No such claim has been made by the Respondent.\n\n**2. The Debt/Equity issue**\n----------------------------\n\n249.\n\nAs the Tribunal will point out in this part of its Decision, the 70% debt and 30% equity split, mentioned in the letter of May 31, 1995, was an assumption introduced into the PPA by virtue of Addendum No. 1 and found by the ICSID 1 tribunal to be a contractual undertaking between the parties to the PPA. Although the ICSID 1 tribunal did not provide a definition of the term \"equity\", the returns provided for in the ICSID award model on which the Implementation Model was based, were calculated on the basis that 30% equity reflected fully paid up share capital. Even apart from the ICSID 1 award, the contemporaneous documents on which the Parties based their arguments do not support the view that the 30% equity could have been provided by way of a shareholder loan. All of this is further reinforced by the reasoning of the ICSID 1 tribunal in the ICSID 1 award.\n\n**a) The background to Addendum No. 1 to the PPA**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe PPA contains no term dealing with the amount of equity, if any, to be contributed by IPTL to the project. As originally drafted and conceived, the PPA was a fixed price contract and hence there would have been no need for IPTL and TANESCO to address that issue in the PPA itself. TANESCO signed the PPA in this original form on May 26, 1995 but it was retained by TANESCO until June 9, 1995, when it was handed over to IPTL at the same time that Addendum No. 1 was signed by both IPTL and TANESCO.283 Addendum No. 1 introduced a significant change to the tariff structure for the PPA in the following terms:\n\nBefore commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff mentioned in Table I of Appendix B will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any or all the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement.284\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019, para. 30. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\nExh. R-2.\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert, David Ehrhardt, described the effect of Addendum No. 1 in the following way:\n\nThus the effect of Addendum No. 1 was to turn this fixed price contract into something closer to a cost plus contract. If key assumptions regarding financing, operating and project costs changed, the Capacity Purchase Price could change, and thereby change the amount TANESCO would pay for the capacity. Problems of interpretation arise, however, because none of the text or the PPA or the Implementation Agreement was modified to accommodate changes required by Addendum No. I.285\n\nExpert Report of David Ehrhardt, August 10, 2012, para. 41.\n\n252.\n\nThis is an accurate description of the PPA before and after the execution of Addendum No. 1.\n\n253.\n\nIn the intervening period between TANESCO\u2019s signing of the PPA and its delivery to IPTL together with the execution of Addendum No. 1, and upon the request of the Government of Tanzania, IPTL sent to the GoT a letter on May 31, 1995 setting out the \"assumptions used to determine the capacity charge.\"286 That letter refers to \"Senior Debt: 70%\" and \"Equity: 30%.\" Addendum No. 1 was signed shortly after on June 9, 1995.\n\nExh. R-3.\n\n**b) The ICSID 1 proceedings**\n------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nTANESCO\u2019s position during the ICSID 1 proceedings was that the introduction of Addendum No. 1 rendered the entire PPA void for uncertainty:\n\n[F]irst, because the assumptions underlying the Reference Tariff were not stated in the PPA, and it was therefore impossible to derive from the words used the parties\u2019 presumed intention as to the assumptions to which the Addendum was intended to refer; and second, because there was no machinery provided in Addendum No. 1 for adjusting the Reference Tariff to take account of any changes in the relevant assumptions.287\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019, para. 13(2). Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n255.\n\nIn addressing TANESCO\u2019s submission, the ICSID 1 tribunal set out four possibilities for the interpretation of Addendum No. 1 :\n\n(1) That the reference to \"assumptions\" was a reference to those set out in appendix H to the PPA, which related only to tax and duty matters;\n\n(2) That the reference to \"assumptions\" was a reference to those set out in the letter of 31 May 1995 to which we have just referred;\n\n(3) That the reference to \"assumptions\" was a reference to all the assumptions which had been made by IPTL in arriving at the Reference Tariff, whether or not expressed in that letter;\n\n(4) That the meaning of Addendum No. 1 was so uncertain that it should be rejected as void and meaningless.288\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019, para. 38. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n256.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal ultimately concluded that possibility (2) should be preferred. The most important consideration in reaching that conclusion appears to be that *\"it [was] common ground that the letter [of May 31, 1995] was before the draftsmen of Addendum**No.* y.\"289 The assumptions set out in the May 31, 1995 letter were thus incorporated into Addendum No. 1 by the ICSID 1 tribunal and hence were deemed to have contractual significance for the parties to the PPA from the date Addendum No. 1 entered into force.\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019, para. 47. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n257.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that the ICSID 1 tribunal did not attempt to trace the assumptions set out in the May 31, 1995 letter to earlier exchanges between the parties to the PPA or other evidence of their mutual intent on the record of the arbitration. In other words, the ICSID 1 tribunal did not interpret its task as discerning whether there was a \"meeting of the minds\" as between the parties on the assumptions set out in the May 31, 1995 letter. Faced with TANESCO\u2019s submission that the whole PPA should be declared void for uncertainty, which the ICSID 1 tribunal described as \"an admission of defeat\" were it to be accepted,290 the ICSID 1 tribunal searched for something on the record that would fill the gap left by the bare mention of \"assumptions\" in Addendum No. 1. The ICSID 1 tribunal found that the May 31, 1995 letter could fill this gap:\n\nAs has been seen from the exchanges of correspondence among the Tanzanian Government, TANESCO and IPTL during the period leading up to the signature of the PPA, the Government was anxious not only that TANESCO should benefit from any savings in the assumptions underlying the PPA, but also to be informed what those assumptions were. **The only assumptions which were reported to TANESCO in response to the Government\u2019s enquiries were those set out in the letter of 31 May 1995.291** (Emphasis added)\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 43. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 45. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n**c) The positions of the Parties in respect of the approach to the interpretation of the term \"Equity\" in the May 31,1995 letter**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties in this arbitration concerns the proper interpretation of the term \"Equity: 30%\" in the May 31, 1995 letter, given that this \"assumption\" was incorporated into the contractual relationship of the parties to the PPA by virtue of the ICSID 1 award. There is, however, no discussion of what is meant by this term in the ICSID 1 award.\n\n259.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s position that the term \"Equity\" in the May 31, 1995 letter *\"is IPTL\u2019s term, not a contractually agreed term between IPTL and Tanesco [...] [a]s such, it is**IPTL\u2019s usage and understanding of the term that is the most important.\"292* The Claimant then relies upon \"*[e]vidence available from a number of sources [that] shows that the word was being used by IPTL in a project finance context, and that Tanesco understood this to be the case.\"293*\n\nCl. PHB, para. 95.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 96.\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent is correct that this approach to discerning the meaning of \"equity\" in the May 31, 1995 letter is impermissible in the circumstances of this case.294 The Claimant has conceded that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" on the issue of what was meant by the term \"equity\";295 indeed the Claimant recognised that *\"nobody ever discussed the meaning of the word \u2018equity\u2019.\"296* This is entirely understandable: such a discussion would have been pointless until the parties resolved to change the PPA from a fixed price contract to a \"cost plus contract\" by executing Addendum No. 1. But given that both Parties accept that there was no \"meeting of the minds\" on the meaning of \"equity\" as an assumption in the May 31, 1995 letter, the Tribunal cannot now fairly place a construction on that term on the basis of documents and correspondence to which only one of the parties to the PPA, IPTL, was privy. This is precisely what the Claimant is asking the Tribunal to do. According to the Claimant:\n\nAs the 31 May 1995 Letter was written by IPTL, the Contemporaneous IPTL Documents should be afforded most weight. The Contemporaneous IPTL Documents show IPTL understood that a shareholder loan qualified as equity.297\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 163-164.\n\nTr. December 3, 2012, page 85, lines 8-9.\n\nTr. December 3, 2012, page 83, lines 20-21.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 122 (heading).\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects this approach. The assumptions set out in the May 31, 1995 letter were incorporated into the PPA via Addendum No. 1 by the decision of the ICSID 1 tribunal. The ICSID 1 award is binding upon the parties to it. The Tribunal cannot legitimately place a construction upon the terms of those assumptions by referring to evidence of only one party\u2019s understanding of a particular term that preceded the May 31, 1995 letter.\n\n262.\n\nAnother approach to the interpretation of the word \"equity\" in the May 31, 1995 letter, proffered by both Parties, is to discern its objective meaning by reference to specialist literature on project finance or more general reference works including dictionaries.298 This approach does not suffer from the same flaw as the approach calling for reliance upon evidence of one party\u2019s understanding of the term \"equity.\" The Parties debated the correct \"objective\" meaning of the word \"equity\" at great length in the written pleadings, expert reports and at the hearing on the merits. Fortunately, in light of the analysis that follows, the Tribunal is not required to resolve this debate.\n\n*E.g.* Expert Report of Colin Johnson, October 26, 2012 (as amended November 6, 2012), paras. 5.13-5.23; Expert Report of David Ehrhardt, August 10, 2012, paras. 93-98.\n\n**d) The ICSID 1 award**\n------------------------\n\n263.\n\nAlthough the ICSID 1 tribunal did not elucidate in its award the meaning of the word \"equity\" in the May 31, 1995 letter, it did implicitly adopt an interpretation of that term in its financial model in Appendix F to the ICSID 1 award (the \"ICSID award model\"). It was agreed by the parties to the PPA that this financial model would supplement the PPA and, in the event of any inconsistency with the PPA, would prevail over the terms of the PPA:\n\nThe parties recognize that there are instances where the formulae, mechanisms, notes, or comments contained in the Financial Model differ from or supplement the terms of the PPA. Where such differences exist, the parties agree that the Financial Model shall govern and supersede the terms of the PPA.299\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix F \u2018Stipulation and Agreement\u2019, para. 2. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n264.\n\nIt was also recognised that certain further adjustments would have to be made to the ICSID award model prior to commencement of commercial operations but that such adjustments would have to be consistent with the assumptions in the ICSID award model:\n\nThe parties recognize that certain further mechanical steps need to be undertaken in order to make the Financial Model fully useful and operational for purposes of billing and tariff adjustment. The parties agree to cooperate together to take whatever steps are required to effectuate that end. However, the parties agree that the Financial Model sets forth the agreement of the parties as to the calculation of the tariff, and that any further steps which are taken must be consistent with the Financial Model.300\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 3. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n265.\n\nThe financial model that was subsequently agreed by the parties before commencement of operations is referred to as the \"Implementation Model.\"\n\n266.\n\nThus, to the extent that the ICSID award model reflected an assumption of the meaning of \"equity\", that assumption became part of the agreement between the parties upon the issuance of the ICSID 1 award on July 12, 2001 and prevailed over any inconsistency in the PPA itself. It also bound the parties to the PPA notwithstanding any adjustments they made in the finalisation of the Implementation Model.\n\n267.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert, David Ehrhardt, set out detailed reasons why he understood the ICSID award model to be constructed on the assumption that \"equity\" could not be in the form of a shareholder loan:\n\nThe Implementation Model [it is clear that Mr. Ehrhardt meant \"ICSID award model\"301] treats equity as equity; the projections contained therein are not compatible with the view that the equity could be \"in the form\" of a shareholder loan. In particular, the model shows that the returns to the shareholders would be provided exclusively through dividends on equity, and not through repayment of any shareholder loan. This is shown by the following:\n\n\u25a0 The model\u2019s only provisions for loan repayment relate to the Senior Debt, which was used to finance 70 percent of the project costs. The model makes no provision for repaying any shareholder loan.\n\n\u25a0 The model states that equity would provide 30 percent of the project funds (totalling $38.2 million), and then projects the payments that would be needed to provide IPTL\u2019s shareholders with the agreed 22.31 percent, after-tax return on that amount of equity at the end of year 20.\n\n\u25a0 The model shows that all of the payments made to achieve the 22.31 percent return on equity are to be made through dividend payments subject to dividend payment constraints, rather than by payments on a loan (which would not be subject to the dividend payment constraints). This is reflected in the \"Accumulated Cash Account for Divds\" section of the Dividends & Accounts sheet. That section shows the dividend payment constraints restrict the amount of cash that can be paid to shareholders for years 8 through 19, which results in a growing accumulation of trapped cash. In year 8, for example, the dividend payment constraints restrict the permissible dividend to $11,429 million out of the $18,391 million in \"After-Tax Cash Available to Pay Dividends,\" which results in trapped cash of $6,962 million that year. Similarly, in year 9, the dividend payment constraints restrict the dividend to $18,065 million out of the $24,182 million in \"After-Tax Cash Available to Pay Dividends,\" which results in the trapped cash growing to $13,079 million that year. As a result of the operation of the dividend payment constraints, the model shows that the trapped cash ultimately grows to $25,361 million in year 20.\n\n\u25a0 In the \"Shareholders Cash Flow & Return\" sheet, the model further shows that that shareholders\u2019 agreed 22.31% after-tax return on equity is achieved in year 20, when the dividends paid over the term of the contract are added to the accumulated trapped cash that could not be paid earlier because of the dividend payment constraints.302\n\nIn a letter to the Tribunal dated February 4, 2013, Mr. Ehrhardt noted that the words \"The Implementation Model\" in this extract should read \"The Award Model\".\n\nExpert Report of David Ehrhardt, August 10, 2012, para. 110.\n\n268.\n\nMr. Ehrhardt concludes this analysis with the following observations:\n\nThe model would have provided an entirely different payment schedule if IPTL were permitted to substitute a shareholder loan for the required 30 percent equity contribution. If the shareholder loan had been permitted in lieu of an equity contribution, the payments to shareholders would not have been subject to the dividend payment constraints, which would have eliminated or reduced the \"trapped cash\" and would have required a much smaller Capacity Payment to provide the agreed 22.31 percent, after-tax return on equity. Therefore, this model confirms that the required 30 percent equity contribution was required to consist of true equity, and not a shareholder loan.303\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 111. The Respondent\u2019s expert on Tanzanian accounting, Mr. Mususa, appeared to adopt a similar position in redirect examination: Tr. December 10, 2012, page 60, line 8 to page 61, line 3.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with Mr. Ehrhardt\u2019s observations. Under Addendum No. 1 to the PPA, the tariff that TANESCO had to pay IPTL was no longer a fixed tariff, but was going to be calculated at the commencement of commercial operations, taking into account any changes that had occurred in the basic assumptions on the basis of which the PPA was signed:\n\nBefore commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff mentioned in Table 1 of Appendix B will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any or all [of] the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement.304\n\nExh. R-2.\n\n270.\n\nThe result was that cost savings would result in a lower tariff, to the benefit of TANESCO, as well as the reverse, *i.e.* that cost increases would result in a higher tariff to the detriment of TANESCO. The Capacity Payment was based on the cost of the financing of the Project as foreseen in the basic assumptions, the cost of financing depending itself on the respective costs of loans and of equity, which were to be in the ratio of 70/30. If in the implementation of the Project this ratio were not respected, the cost would be different, and depending on the situation TANESCO would be required to pay more or less than it was due to pay under the ICSID award model.\n\n271.\n\nIt has to be underscored that loans are paid before taxation and dividends distributed after taxation. The financial effect of replacing true equity, *i.e.* paid up capital by a shareholder loan, was explained by Mr. Ehrhardt. The Tribunal is persuaded that a shareholder\u2019s loan would cost a substantial amount less than true equity over the life of the project, even if both earned exactly the same rate of return. This means that in replacing equity by a shareholder loan, IPTL was incurring less costs than the costs used for the calculation of the Capacity Payment. In other words, TANESCO was paying more than what it would have had to pay under the assumptions if they had been respected. The tax assumptions are set forth in Appendix H to the PPA, where it is indicated that Corporate Income tax is equal to 0% during the first five years and equal to 35% from year 6 to 20. The Capacity Payment is deemed to pay for the cost of capital, *i.e.* for the reimbursement of the loans, the taxes to be paid and the dividends on equity. Because loans are repaid before taxation and dividends after taxation, the replacement of equity by loans necessarily has an influence on the amount of taxes to be paid. The simple explanation is that, if taxes are paid on the amount earned less repayment of the debt, then they are higher because they are calculated on a higher amount of income than if they are calculated on the amount earned after both repayment of the senior debt and repayment of the shareholders\u2019 loan. The difference in the global cost - on which the Capacity Payment\u2019s calculation was based - is the economy realized in tax payments, which has not been taken into account in the calculation of the Capacity Payment. The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent\u2019s observation that: *\"As a result, TANESCO was being charged to \u2018reimburse\u2019 IPTL for millions of dollars in taxes that would never be incurred.\"305* Whilst the Tribunal has not made its own calculation of the amount in taxes, it is clear that in principle TANESCO was effectively reimbursing IPTL for taxes that would only have been incurred if the project sponsors had contributed paid-up capital instead of shareholders\u2019 loans.\n\nResp. CM, para. 174.\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert, Colin Johnson, did not seek to rebut these specific points made by Mr. Ehrhardt in his expert report.306 Mr. Johnson conceded that *\"[t]he model certainly does not provide a separate line for subordinated debt paid out differently than share capital.\"307* Nonetheless, Mr. Johnson maintained that Mr. Ehrhardt\u2019s points were irrelevant, primarily because \"*[a] model is not reality but an approximation for it. It also does not set out the structure for a project [..].\"308*\n\nExpert Report of Colin Johnson, October 26, 2012 (as amended November 6, 2012), paras. 5.49-5.52.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 5.50.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 5.50.1.\n\n273.\n\nWhether or not financial models reflect the reality of a project or set the structure for a project as a general matter in project finance transactions, the situation in this case is *sui generis.* The ICSID 1 award incorporated the assumptions set out in the ICSID award model and, by reference, the Implementation Model, as a constituent element of the parties\u2019 contractual relationship. Not only were those assumptions incorporated into the parties\u2019 contractual relationship, but also henceforth they were to prevail over any inconsistent terms in the parties\u2019 existing contractual relationship under the PPA. It follows that any assumption about the nature of \"equity\" reflected in the ICSID award model is binding on the parties to the PPA regardless of what either party understood by that term prior to the ICSID 1 award and regardless of what that term might be understood to mean in the general literature on project finance.\n\n274.\n\nIndeed, later in his report, Mr. Johnson states: *\"Whilst I am clear that what the Implementation Model does is not what was originally intended in the PPA, I agree that it was accepted by both parties in the Stipulation and Agreement and is therefore the agreed approach.\"309* The reality is, however, that the only \"meeting of the minds\" relating to the equity issue is the parties\u2019 agreement on the assumptions underlying the ICSID award model, which were adopted by the ICSID 1 tribunal and which, in any case, supersede any prior assumptions in accordance with the express terms of the Stipulation and Agreement as Appendix F to the ICSID 1 award.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 5.52.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied, based on the observations made by the Respondent\u2019s expert on the ICSID award model and the Implementation Model, that there was an assumption built into these models that IPTL would contribute \"true\" equity and was not permitted to substitute a shareholder loan for that 30% equity contribution. In accordance with the Stipulation and Agreement as Appendix F to the ICSID 1 award, this assumption has been incorporated into the contractual relationship between the parties to the PPA and is binding upon the parties to the PPA. Thus, any quantification of the IPTL\u2019s entitlement to Capacity Payments must reflect the assumption that the IPTL\u2019s 30% equity contribution would be in the form of paid-up share capital. **Accordingly, before this Tribunal can quantify the amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA, the tariff must be recalculated to take account of that fact that there had not been a 30% equity contribution in the form of paid up share capital.**\n\n**e) The principal contemporaneous documents do not, in any event, support the Claimant\u2019s understanding of \"Equity\"**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nEven in the absence of the ICSID 1 award and the implicit determination of the \"equity\" issue therein, the important contemporaneous documents do not support the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of \"equity\" for the purposes of the assumption set out in the May 31, 1995 letter.\n\n**The Promoters/ Shareholders Agreement dated September 28,1994 (Exh. C-48/R-45)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThis document was not transmitted to TANESCO; indeed, there was an obligation pursuant to Article 10 not to disclose its existence: *\"Each of the parties [which are VIP, as the First Sponsor and Mechmar as the Second Sponsor] hereto agrees, for as long as it is a party to this Agreement,* ***to keep strictly secret and confidential [...]*** *any or all technical, economic,* ***financial,*** *marketing or other information acquired from any party hereto, or from the company [...].\"* (Emphasis added)\n\n278.\n\nThe agreement envisages the creation of IPTL, with an authorized capital of *\"Ten Million (US$10,000,000.00) divided into one million (1,000,000) ordinary shares at United States of America Ten dollars (US$10.00) par value each [...]\"* It was moreover specified that:\n\nThe paid-up capital of the company shall be United States of America Dollars One million (US$1,000,000.00) which shall be subscribed for by the parties [...] in the ratio as set out below:\n\n(a) as to the First Promoter United States of America dollars Three hundred thousand (US$300,000.00) at par value in cash to be advanced by the Second Promoter [...] of Thirty thousand (30,000) ordinary shares in the company always representing 30% of the company\u2019s paid-up capital for the time being\n\n(b) as to the Second Promoter United States of America dollars Seven hundred thousand (US$700,000.00) at par value in cash of Seventy thousand (70,000) ordinary shares in the company always representing 70% of the company\u2019s paid-up capital for the time being [...].\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant\u2019s argument that it was always foreseen that equity would only be partially constituted by paid-up capital. According to the Claimant: *\"it is clear from the $10,000,000 authorised share capital agreed that IPTL\u2019s shareholders never intended to contribute the full amount of equity in the Power Plant by way of paid up share capital.\"310* The fact that an initial amount of capital is indicated is without prejudice to the evolution of the capital and of possible capital increases. This conclusion is reinforced by the reference to the words \"for the time being.\" It is not unusual for a company not to have the fully authorized and paid-up capital when it is first created. The reference to this minimal arrangement for starting the company does not indicate that the final paid-up capital when the plant started to operate would not be around US$45 million as indicated by IPTL to the Tanzanian Government in its proposal a month later.311\n\nCl. PHB, para. 127.\n\n*See infra* paras. 283-289.\n\n280.\n\nIt should also be noted that it appears from the Memorandum and Articles of Association dated November 1, 1994312 that if the authorized capital was indeed in conformity with the Shareholders/Promoters Agreement, the paid up capital was only Tanzanian shillings 50,000, which is the equivalent of US$100. This is much less than what had been envisaged \"for the time being\" and has no relationship to the representations made to the GoT in the same month. It is also to be noted that in this document, the power for the company to increase its capital is explicitly mentioned in paragraph 39(d).\n\nExh. R-61.\n\n281.\n\nThe fact that the initial intention was indeed to have 30% of equity and not a shareholder loan, as transmitted to the GoT in the framework of the negotiation of the PPA with TANESCO, is confirmed by the draft prepared by Deloitte & Touche for the Tanzanian Revenue Authority on November 2, 1998313 where the anticipated scheme was explained as follows:\n\n**Share Capital**\n\nProject Financing Equity, is in line with the Loan Facility Agreement which yourselves have viewed where the Debt Equity ratio equals to 70:30. There is no correlation between the issued and paid up share capital as per the Companies Ordinance, Chapter 212, Section 108 and 307 with reference to share capital and shares, It is clear that IPTL Nominal Share Capital TShs 5,000,000,000 divided into 1,000,000 shares is TShs 5000 each, The issued and paid up share capital of IPTL is 10 shares of TShs 5000 each, amounting to TShs 50,000.00. The call and allotment of the remaining shares to the tune of USD 45 million will be done after the Power Station has been completed and commissioned. The Equity or Paid up Share Capital, thereafter will be in the following ratio:\n\nMechmar Corp Berhad 70% = USD 31.50 million\n\nVIP Engineering & Marketing Ltd. 30% = USD 13.50 million\n\nTotal Equity or Nominal Share Capital or Authorised Share Capital USD 45.00 million\n\nExh. R-125.\n\n282.\n\nIt is interesting to note that IPTL had suggested the deletion of the commitment to have a fully paid-up capital of US$45 million after the commencement of commercial operations, including the following sentence: *\"The call and allotment of the remaining shares to the tune of USD 45 million will be done after the Power Station has been completed and commissioned.\"*\n\n**Proposal for a Privatised 100MW Power Development in Tanzania dated November 21,1994 (Exh. C-173)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThis document contains a proposal for a 100 MW power station to serve as the TANESCO power station, submitted in response to a Memorandum of Understanding between Mechmar Corporation and the Government of Tanzania.\n\n284.\n\nThis is one of the first documents addressed to the GoT in relation to this project. IPTL\u2019s proposal document, addressed to the GoT, states that the total cost of the project would be US$148 million: the anticipated equity requirement was US$44.4 million and the remaining part was to be financed by loans. In para. 7.2, it is stated that:\n\nIndependent Power Tanzania Ltd. will pursue a **project finance strategy** for the financing of the Project, **on a limited recourse basis.** The concept of project finance can be defined as a financing method in which the burden of credit support comes from the economic viability and cashflow of the project itself.314 (Emphasis added)\n\n*See* Exh. C-173, para. 7.2, page number SCBHK/D/003375.\n\n285.\n\nThe finance plan was described as follows:\n\nThe proposal is based on a debt equity ratio of 70:30. The anticipated equity requirement is US$44.4 million.315\n\nExh. C-173, page number SCBHK/D/003179.\n\n286.\n\nDebt was to be raised on the financial markets whereas the project sponsors were to *\"contribute all of the equity needed for the Project.\"* It was stated in para. 2.5.2:\n\nThe financial advisor for the Project will seek to raise all of the debt in the financial markets. The Project sponsors will, on their part, contribute all of the equity needed for the Project, on a parri [sic] passu basis with the debt.\n\n287.\n\nThe financial terms are elaborated further in section 7 of the proposal:\n\nIndependent Power Tanzania Ltd. will secure construction and term financing for the Project at competitive terms so that a sound and attractive financial structure supports the overall venture. The financial structure of the Project will be developed to:\n\n- provide **an adequate level of debt** financing for the Project;\n\n- maintain sufficient margins of financial safety;\n\n- provide **equity investors** with a **commercial rate of return on their funds;**\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n288.\n\nIn the same section 7, two different paragraphs are then devoted to the financing of equity and the financing of debt:\n\n**7.4.2.2** **Terms and Conditions of Equity**\n\nThe optimal combination of debt and equity results in a reasonable return to equity while maintaining a competitive tariff for the sale of electricity.... the Project financial advisors recommend an equity level of 30 percent of project costs for this Project. Equity is anticipated to be funded parri passu with the debt.\n\nIn summary, the following are the assumptions regarding equity for the Project (Base Case):\n\nDebt-equity ratio 70:30\n\nTotal amount US$ 148 million\n\nCommitment date at financial closing\n\nDrawdown period 24 months, parri passu with loan drawdown\n\n**7.4.3.2** **Terms and Conditions of Debt**\n\n**Total debt** for the Project is expected to account for 70% of the total project costs [...].\n\nThe following are the expected terms for the loan facility for the Project:\n\nRatio of debt to equity 70:30\n\nTotal amount USD 148 million\n\nTerms of debt 24 months construction and 7 years term loan\n\nRepayment basis 7 years, unequal semi-annual repayments\n\nInterest during construction Fully capitalised & added to construction costs\n\nInterest rate 10.94% per annum\n\nWithholding tax rate on interest 20%\n\nInterest rate after withholding tax 13.68%\n\nDrawdown period 24 months, parri [sic] passu with equity\n\nDebt-service reserves 6 months of debt service, funded from Project cash flow\n\n**7.5.1** **Capital Costs**\n\nThe total sources of funds are as follows (USD\u2019000):\n\nEquity 44,379\n\nSenior Debt 103,551\n\nTOTAL 147,930\n\n**7.8 THE FINANCIAL MODEL**\n\nThe financial advisor has developed a financial model that incorporates cash flows of the Project including financing flows and tax and profit calculations for the entire term of the Project (20 years). The proposed electricity tariff is then derived from the estimated operations and maintenance expenses, tax payments, fuel cost and **acceptable levels of debt service and return on equity.** (Emphasis added)\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this document to be of particular significance, because there is a clear reference to the \"total debt\" that was expected to account for 70% of the costs. This does not appear to be consistent with the Claimant\u2019s position that the \"70%\" in the ratio of debt to equity referred only to the senior debt, leaving open the possibility that shareholders\u2019 loans could be added.\n\n**The May 31,1995 letter (Exh. C-38/R-3)**\n------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nAs previously noted, the ICSID 1 tribunal concluded that this letter set out the basic assumptions underlying the PPA.\n\n291.\n\nThere is a reference in the May 31, 1995 letter to IPTL\u2019s 1994 proposal as examined above. Indeed IPTL stated that they *\"wish to confirm that the following assumptions used to determine the capacity charge are contained in the MECHMAR proposal submitted to the Government in November 1994 which was the basis of negotiations and agreements reached in January, 1995.\"*\n\n292.\n\nAmong other key assumptions, the letter indicates the total projected cost of the project as US$163.5 million; the debt/equity ratio of the project at 70% senior debt and 30% equity; the aggregate rate of interest for the senior debt at 10.94% with an amortisation period of 7 years; and the internal rate of return on equity (the \"IRR\") at 23%.\n\n**The 1995 Financial Model (Exh. R-99)**\n----------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe same assumptions also underlie the 1995 Financial Model. This model was not transmitted to TANESCO but it is an indication of the intention of the investors at that time to make a contribution in the form of paid-up capital. This is because it is a model in which dividends are taken into account, which implies that there was going to be not only debt, but also 30% of \"true\" equity.\n\n294.\n\nAt that time, the total cost of the project was valued at US$163,531,000.00. For this amount the source of funds were indicated as follows in thousands of US$:\n\nSenior Debt 70%: 114,472 Equity 30%: 49,059\n\n295.\n\nThe Senior Debt was to be amortized over 7 years and the aggregate rate of interest was to be 10,940%.\n\n296.\n\nThe 1995 Financial Model also has an entry \"Taxable Operating Income \" which is based on the \"Operating Margin\" \"Less: Interest on Senior Debt\" which gives the \"Income Before Capital Allowances\".316 The \"Interest on Senior Debt\" was foreseen as follows, in thousands of US$: 12,523 in 1998, 10,770 in 1999, 8,891 in 2000, 6,888 in 2001, 4,759, in 2002, 3,131, in 2003, 783 in 2004 and 0 for all the following years from 2005 to 2017, with a total of 47,745. As far as the repayment of the capital was concerned, it was also foreseen to be achieved in 7 years, with the following figures for the \"Total Senior Debt Service\": 28,549 in 1998, 27,941 in 1999, 27,207 in 2000, 26,348 in 2001, 25,364 in 2002, 20,303 in 2004, 6,506 in 2004 and 0 for the following years. The debt was clearly distinct from another entry \"Dividends Payments \"317 which refers to the \"After Tax Cash Available to Pay Dividends\", the sums, in thousands of US$ also, being the following: 0 in 1998, 12,410, in 1999, 16,103, in 2000, 16,962, in 2001, 17,946 in 2002, 14,099 in 2003, 18,072 in 2004, 18,678 in 2005, 27,920, in 2007, 27,920 in 2008, 27,920 in 2009, 27,920 in 2010, 27,920 in 2011, 27,920, in 2012, 27,920 in 2013, 27,920 in 2014, 27,920 in 2015, 27,920 in 2016, 27,920 in 2017 making a total of Dividends available for distribution of 449,314.\n\nExh. R-99, pages 29-30.\n\n*Id.*\n\n297.\n\nMoreover, the reference tariff table at the last page of the 1995 Financial Model has been incorporated in Table 1 to Appendix B to the PPA.\n\n298.\n\nThe separate entries concerning the senior debt and the equity contribution are quite evident from this 1995 Financial Model, which served as the template for all the models that followed, and which maintained the same distinction between debt and equity.\n\n**The Power Purchase Agreement dated May 26,1995 (Exh. C-4/R-1)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThere is a link between the 1995 Financial Model and the PPA because in its Article 1 devoted to \"Definitions\", the terms \"Capital Component\" and \"Debt Component\" are given \"(t)he meaning ascribed thereto in Appendix B\".\n\n300.\n\nIn this Appendix B, a clear distinction can be found again between the \"Capital Component\" and the \"Debt Component\", defined as follows:\n\n**Capacity Purchase Price Components**\n\n8.1 Capital Component\n\nThis component includes the fixed operations and maintenance cost, the insurance cost, the administrative cost and the **return on equity,** etc. The Capital Component will be escalated in accordance with the procedure in Section 13.\n\n8.2 Debt Component\n\nThis component covers the **debt servicing charges** including payments of principal, interest and other fees to THE SELLER'S Lenders. This component will decline with the passage of time as the loans related to the Project are repaid and shall be adjusted for Exchange Rate and Interest Rate fluctuation according to Section 13.\n\n301.\n\nAlso, the mechanisms for adjustments of the Capital Component of the Capacity Purchase Price and the Debt Component of the Capacity Purchase Price are not the same, as is clear from Article 13.2 of Appendix B.\n\n302.\n\nTable 1 annexed to this Appendix is also based on a clear distinction between debt and equity:\n\nTable 1\n\nREFERENCE TARIFF\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Contract Year | Capital Component (USD/kW/Month) | Debt Component (USD/kW/Month) | Capacity Purchase Price (USD/kW/Month) | Fuel Cost Component (US cents/kWh) | Variable Operations and Maintenance Component (US cents/kWh) | Energy Purchase (US cents/kWh) |\n| 1 | 17.44 | 24.43 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 2 | 17.96 | 23.91 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 3 | 18.59 | 23.28 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 4 | 19.33 | 22.55 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 5 | 20.17 | 21.71 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 6 | 24.50 | 17.37 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 7 | 36.31 | 5.57 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 8 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 9 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 10 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 11 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 12 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 13 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 14 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 15 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 16 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 17 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 18 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 19 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n| 20 | 41.88 | 0 | 41.88 | 2.23 | 1.02 | 3.25 |\n\n**The Facility Agreement, June 28,1997 (Exh. C-l l/R-47)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nTANESCO was not privy to this agreement but it throws light on what IPTL negotiated at that time with the Malaysian banks concerning the financing of the project. Through this agreement, IPTL received a loan facility from several Malaysian banks of US$105,000,000.00. It shows that the understanding with the banks did not match the commitment to TANESCO, which was that the \"total debt\" should not amount to more than 70% of the cost of the project. It is stated that:\n\n\"Debt Equity Ratio\" means as at any date the ratio of (1) the Outstandings of all the Banks as at that date to (2) the total amount of equity subscribed and fully paid up on that date by the Shareholders to the Borrower [IPTL] by way of either (a) the subscription for ordinary shares or (b) the provision of subordinated loans.318\n\nExh. C-l l/R-47, page 4.\n\n304.\n\nAlso the \"Shareholders Funds\" was defined as follows:\n\n\"Shareholders Funds\" means the aggregate of the amount which the Shareholders are obliged to provide to the Borrower (whether by way of subscription for shares or by means of the provision of subordinated loans or otherwise) under the Shareholder Support Deed.319\n\nExh. C-l l/R-47, page 17.\n\n305.\n\nThe financing was still based on a 70/30% debt/equity ratio, and it was made clear that IPTL could only draw down on the loan facility if the shareholders had provided their part of the financing:\n\nArticle 18 A (19) Equity: the Borrower will procure that:\n\n(i) on or prior to each drawdown, Shareholders\u2019 Funds of not less than the equivalent of thirty per cent (30%) of aggregate Project Expenditure at any time [...] shall have been paid in cash into the Project Bank Account before each drawdown or otherwise applied to meet Construction Expenditure;\n\n306.\n\nIn the \"Shareholder Support Deed\" of the same date, the debt/equity ratio and the manner in which it should be implemented is reiterated in the same terms and it is moreover agreed between the shareholders, IPTL and the banks that they undertake not to *\"create or permit to exist a Security Interest securing all or any part of the Subordinated Indebtedness.\"320*\n\nExh. C-40, Art. 4.5.2 (i)(a).\n\n307.\n\nThis agreement was not fully implemented as the entire amount of the loan facility was not used. As evidenced in the record, between August 1997 and December 1999, nine drawdowns were approved by the lenders for a total of US$85,862,022.06 advanced to IPTL under the Facility Agreement.321 However, following the ninth drawdown, the lenders indicated to IPTL that they would not permit any further drawdowns in light of the commencement of the ICSID 1 proceedings. No further drawdowns were made and the total amount advanced under the Facility Agreement remained as US$85,862,022.06.\n\nExh. C-41.\n\n308.\n\nThe fact that the Malaysian banks were willing to accept that equity could be replaced by shareholder loans cannot, of course, be dispositive as to the meaning of \"equity\" as an assumption underlying the PPA.\n\n309.\n\nIn conclusion, the principal contemporaneous documents do not evidence an understanding that \"equity\" could be contributed in the form of shareholders\u2019 loans; more unequivocally, they certainly do not evidence that such an understanding was ever communicated to or accepted by TANESCO. As previously held, however, this is irrelevant in the final analysis because the ICSID 1 award was clearly decided on the basis that \"equity\" was paid-up capital and that award, or more specifically its financial model, is binding on the parties.\n\n**f) The findings in the ICSID 1 arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nGiven the importance of the ICSID 1 arbitration to the \"equity\" issue under consideration, the Tribunal now provides an additional summary of the ICSID 1 tribunal\u2019s principal findings relating to the adjustment of the tariff and how they were reflected in the ICSID award model.\n\n311.\n\nOne of the questions before the ICSID 1 tribunal was to determine *\"[w]hat, if any, adjustment should be made to the Reference Tariff by reason of the alleged reduction in IPTL\u2019s deemed equity* [..]?\"322\n\nICSID 1 award, para. 57(3). Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n312.\n\nThe tribunal\u2019s answer was in the negative: *\"The Tribunal rejected TANESCO\u2019s submission that there should be a further adjustment to the Reference Tariff by reason of the alleged reduction of IPTL\u2019s equity contribution to the project.\"323*\n\nICSID 1 award, para. 62. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n313.\n\nIn the Decision on Preliminary issues,324 included in Appendix B, one of the preliminary issues to be dealt with was the following:\n\nHow is the final Reference Tariff to be calculated, in the light of the said change [the change in the diesel engines and other differences in the building] and any other differences which may be established?325\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019. Exh. C-10/R.-8.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 2.3.\n\n314.\n\nAppendix C, Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues,326 is devoted in part to the principles to be used in the adjustment of the Reference Tariff. The focus was on the costs that were either not at all, or not reasonably incurred. In dealing with this question, the ICSID 1 tribunal arrived at some conclusions. First, it decided that the cost of the EPC contract of Warstila was not reasonable and had to be reduced by US$10 million, and by a further US$6 million because of housing that was accounted for but not built; and second, it decided that the \"Development Costs\" had to be reduced, especially the \"Staff and Management Costs\" amounting to US$6,238,000, including US$5,385,000 for \"work performed by Mechmar directors and employees\" which was deemed to be unreasonable and thus should be reduced by US$2.5 million. The total amount allowed for Development Costs was valued by the tribunal at US$3,036,064.00.\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix C \u2018Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues\u2019. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n315.\n\nThe question of the tariff adjustment was again addressed by the tribunal when it revisited the question of *\"[w]hat, if any, adjustment should be made to the Reference Tariff by reason of the alleged reduction in IPTL\u2019s deemed equity [...]?\"* in Appendix D.327\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix D \u2018Decision on All Further Remaining Questions\u2019, para. 7(4). Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n316.\n\nIn revisiting this issue, the tribunal made reference in a footnote to Dr Swales\u2019 Fifth Witness Statement to the effect that *\"he was unable to verify from the documents produced by IPTL that it did in fact contribute equity equal to 30% of the claimed project costs.\"328*\n\n*lb id.,* para. 23.\n\n317.\n\nThe problem raised here was whether or not different disallowed costs should be taken out of the debt portion or the equity portion, with the result that it might call for a re-evaluation of the proportion between debt and equity. But neither was the existing proportion of equity as such contested, nor was its implementation verified. The tribunal agreed with IPTL\u2019s contention that *\"one should not assume for these purposes that these items of claimed expenditure were to be identified as having been funded by or attributed to IPTL\u2019s equity contribution, and others as being the product of bank loans. Both aspects of the money contributed went to one notional \u2018pot\u2019 from which expenditure was made.\"329* Therefore, the tribunal concluded that it was difficult to determine *\"what contribution was in fact made by the banks on the one hand or by IPLL on the other in relation to each item of claimed cost which the Lribunal rejected or reduced.\"330* In other words, the ICSID 1 tribunal considered that the disallowed costs, even if they were initially costs accounted as part of equity, were to be allocated between debt and equity, so that the two amounts should be diminished proportionally, in order to ensure that the 70:30% ratio was maintained, as one of the basic assumptions on which the PPA rested. The amounts of debt and equity were therefore reduced in order to keep the 70/30 ratio. The total cost was reduced from US$163,531 (in thousands of US$) to US$127,201 (in thousands of US$), the respective amounts of debt and equity were modified proportionally, which meant that the figures included in the ICSID award model were the following, in thousands of US$:\n\nSenior Debt 70%: 89,041 Equity 30%: 38,160\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix D \u2018Decision on All Further Remaining Questions\u2019, para. 25.

C-10/R-8.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 26.\n\n318.\n\nThe ICSID award model includes the modifications introduced by the ICSID 1 tribunal, as far as the total costs are concerned, with the consequential change in the respective amounts of debt and equity in order to keep the ratio of 70/30%, as well as the agreed modification by the parties of the IRR to 22.33, which was incorporated in the award, and the extension of the amortisation period of the senior debt from 7 to 8 years.\n\n319.\n\nThe \"Senior Debt\" was foreseen to be repaid in 8 years with the following parameters: \"Amortisation %\" was to be 18% in 2001, 20% in 2002, 22% in 2003, 10% in 2004, 10% in 2005, 5% in 2006, 5% in 2007, 10% in 2008 and 0% for all the following years from 2008 to 2020; the \"Interest Rate\" (grossed up) was 8,500% in the years 2001 to 2005 and 10% in the years 2006 to 2008, with a rate of 0% for all the following years from 2008 to 2020; the \"Total Senior Debt Service\" implied payments in thousands of USD of 23,255 in 2001, 23,616 in 2002, 23,865 in 2003, 11,747 in 2004, 10,985 in 2005, 6,122 in 2007, 9,572 in 2008 and 0 for all the following years from 2008 to 2020.\n\n320.\n\nThe dividends on equity were dealt with separately, and were foreseen to be distributed only after two years of operation. In other words, the \"Dividends Paid\" in thousands of USD were indicated along the following schedule: 0 in 2001, 0 in 2002, 5,132 in 2003, 18,368 in 2004, 21,378 in 2005, 14,250 in 2006, 10, 286 in 2007, 16,259 in 2008, 16,460 in 2009, 18,384 in 2010, 18,480 in 2012, 18,576 in 2013, 18,672 in 2014, 18,768 in 2015, 18, 863 in 2016, 18,959 in 2017, 19,055 in 2018, 19,151 in 2019, 19,247 in 2020. Again this is not reconcilable with the existence of only US$100 of \"true\" equity.\n\n321.\n\nThe \"Drawdown Schedule\" to implement the senior loan as foreseen in the Facility Agreement, was reduced by the ICSID 1 tribunal in order to take into account its decisions on the reduction of costs. Also in this Schedule, the \"Equity Contribution to Match Drawdowns\" were clearly indicated, as can been seen, for example for the first 6 years of operation:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Tanzania 100MWIPP |\n| SOURCES & USES OF FUNDS - CONSTRUCTION | Fin.

And the same holds true for the subsequent years.\n\n323.\n\nIt was also indicated at the end of Appendix F to the ICSID 1 award entitled \"Stipulation and Agreement\"331 that *[t]he parties recognize that certain further mechanical steps need to be undertaken in order to make the Financial Model fully useful and operational [...] the parties agree that [...] any further steps which are taken must be consistent with the Financial Model. \"*\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix F \u2018Stipulation and Agreement\u2019, para. 3. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, therefore, in light of the decision of the ICSID 1 tribunal, specifically as it relates to the assumptions to be included in the ICSID award model and hence in the Implementation Model, of the contemporaneous documents relied on by the Parties, as well as of the reasoning contained in the ICSID 1 tribunal\u2019s determinations, that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the equity contribution to the project could be by way of shareholder loan. **Accordingly, before the Tribunal can quantify the amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA, the tariff must be recalculated to reflect the fact that IPTL\u2019s 30% equity contribution was not in the form of paid-up share capital.**\n\n**g) What are the parameters for a recalculation of the Capacity Payment?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the first question to answer is the cut-off date at which a recalculation of the Capacity Change should be made, as the Parties had strongly diverging views on that issue. The next question is whether the Tribunal should endeavour to recalculate this amount itself on the basis of all the expert presentations before it or refer the matter back to the Parties and then perhaps convene a further hearing, if the Parties cannot agree on the recalculation.\n\n**(i) When is the cut-off date for recalculation of the Capacity Payment?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the cut-off date is September 1998, when the commercial operation should have commenced, relying on the following conclusion of the ICSID 1 tribunal:\n\nThe Reference Tariff should be adjusted in accordance with Addendum 1 by reference to changes that had taken place, before commercial operations would have commenced but for TANESCO\u2019s purported Notice of Default, in any of the assumptions listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter [...] dated 31 May 1995.332\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019, para. 119. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n327.\n\nThe Respondent, relying on another earlier conclusion of the same tribunal, insisted on the fact that all changes that were made in the assumptions of the May 31, 1995 letter before the effective date of commencement of the operation, which would be January 2002, should be taken into account:\n\nThe result of our conclusions [...] is that the Reference Tariff falls to be adjusted \"upwards or downwards\", depending on changes that have taken place in any of the underlying assumptions stated in IPTL\u2019s letter dated May 31, 1995.333\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix B \u2018Decision on Preliminary Issues\u2019, para. 109. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n328.\n\nIn Appendix F to the ICSID 1 award, which is an integral part of the award, the following is stipulated:\n\nTANESCO and IPTL agree that the tariff which is to be calculated pursuant to the Power Purchase Agreement (\"PPA\") dated 26 May 1995, as amended, shall be calculated based on the Decisions of the Arbitrators herein dated 9 February 2001 and 24 May 2001, the applicable terms of the PPA, and the financial model [...] annexed hereto [...] (the \"Financial Model\"). The tariff shall be calculated initially at commencement of commercial operation of the Tegeta power plant and during the term of the PPA in accordance with the PPA and the Financial Model.\n\n329.\n\nThe Decision on Tariffs and Other Remaining Issues of February 9, 2001 is Appendix C to the ICSID 1 award, the Decision, on All Further Remaining Issues of May 24, 2001 is Appendix D to the ICSID 1 award. The Respondent argued that Appendix B, in which the statement concerning the cut-off date as the date of commercial operations but for the notice of default, was not taken into account in the agreement of the parties endorsed by the ICSID 1 tribunal. Instead, according to the Respondent, it was agreed by the parties to the ICSID 1 arbitration, TANESCO and IPTL, and integrated in the ICSID 1 award, that the tariff was to be calculated at the actual commencement of commercial operation.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent. A careful reading of the ICSID 1 award shows that the Respondent\u2019s reasoning is based on a false premise, *i.e.* that the parties do not refer to Appendix B. The reverse is true, as the following is stated in Appendix C, which the parties indeed agreed to follow:\n\n[...] on 22 May 2000 the Tribunal issued its Decision On Preliminary Issues of Construction/Law, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix **B** and which **is incorporated herein by reference.** As set forth in paragraph 19 of that Decision, the \"Conclusions\" of the Tribunal on the Preliminary Issues were as follows:\n\n[...]\n\nThat the Reference Tariff should be adjusted in accordance with Addendum No. 1 by reference to changes that had taken place, **before commercial operations would have commenced** but for TANESCO\u2019s purported Notice of Default, in any of the assumptions listed in Mr Rugemalira\u2019s letter to the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated 31 May 1995 [...]334 (Emphasis added)\n\nICSID 1 award, Appendix C \u2018Decision on Tariff and Other Remaining Issues\u2019, para. 33. Exh. C-10/R-8.\n\n331.\n\nLast but not least, the same statement was reiterated in the ICSID 1 award itself at paragraph 34 (3).\n\n332.\n\n**The Tribunal concludes therefore that the cut-off date is the date when the commercial operation would have commenced,** if TANESCO had not presented a notice of default, which gave rise to the ICSID 1 proceedings, in other words, that the cut-off date is September 1998.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to indicate the consequences of this ruling on the cut-off date on the final settlement of the case.\n\n334.\n\nIt is not contested that the failure to make the equity contribution as it should have been made in light of the assumptions of the PPA, occurred before September 1998. Thus, there must be a recalculation of the Capacity Payment because the change of the assumption concerning the Debt/Equity ratio of 70/30% happened before that date.\n\n335.\n\nBasing itself on the date of the real commencement of the operation of the plant, the Respondent argued also for a further recalculation of the Capacity Payment, because it alleged that the senior debt had been restructured in violation of the assumptions of the May 31, 1995 letter, which provided for a an amortization period of 7 years, stating for example that:\n\nIPTL\u2019s secret restructuring of 100% of its debt prior to COD of the Facility, its failure to fully and accurately disclose the changes to the key assumptions from the 31 May 1995 letter and to provide accurate information concerning the senior debt in order to properly calculate the tariff prior to COD, and its agreement to alter the waterfall of payments in a manner that was inconsistent with the requirements of the ICSID 1 Award all constitute breaches of IPTL\u2019s contractual obligations to TANESCO under Addendum 1 to the PPA and the PPA\u2019s incorporated financial model.335\n\nResp. PHB, para. 266.\n\n336.\n\nThis argument cannot be accepted by the Tribunal, both for the reasons set out in paras. 347-353 *infra* and because the restructuring of the senior debt clearly took place after September 1998.\n\n**(ii) How to proceed with recalculation?**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the question of recalculation was discussed extensively in the reports of the experts of the Parties. The Tribunal also notes that the Parties were in agreement that if the Tribunal were to consider recalculation necessary, then providing the Parties with an opportunity to attempt to agree on the recalculation was preferable.336 The Tribunal agrees and directs the Parties to undertake such an attempt.\n\nFor the views of the Respondent, *see* Respondent PHB, para. 19; for the views of the Claimant, *see* Tr. March 14, 2013, page 36, lines 23-25, page 37, lines 1-6, page 38, lines 1-9.\n\n338.\n\nIn seeking to agree on the tariff the Parties are to be guided by the following considerations.\n\n339.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal does not believe that a tariff of 22.31% would be appropriate. That tariff was based on an assumption that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution could be made by way of shareholder loan, which the Tribunal has rejected. Furthermore, as the Tribunal has pointed out in this Decision, the substitution of a shareholder loan for equity resulted in benefits accruing to IPTL, in particular in relation to taxation, which were not contemplated under the PPA. Simply to agree on a tariff of 22.31% would effect no change in the situation between the Parties.\n\n340.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is equally of the view that a 0% tariff would be inappropriate. Since the Parties\u2019 experts do not suggest that this would be an appropriate tariff in any event,337 this does not appear to be a matter of contention.\n\nExpert Report of David Ehrhardt dated August 10, 2012, para. 126; Expert Report of Cohn Johnson dated October 26, 2012 (as amended on November 6, 2012), para. 6.37.\n\n341.\n\nThird, the recalculated tariff cannot introduce new assumptions into the relationship of the Parties or require new elements in that relationship. Thus, a tariff based on the assumption that new capital or further shareholder loans would have been provided by IPTL is also inappropriate.\n\n342.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal considers that the tariff has to be set in a way that recognizes that the rate of return for the shareholder loan is higher than the return on senior debt. The Parties\u2019 experts both acknowledged that since the senior debt ranked higher in security than the shareholder loan, a higher rate of return would have been expected for the shareholder loan.338 The Tribunal agrees.\n\nExpert Report of Colin Johnson dated October 26, 2012 (as amended on November 6, 2012), para. 6.37.\n\n343.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal directs the Parties to enter into discussions on the recalculation of the tariff taking account of the above considerations, as well as all other conclusions reached in this Decision with a view to reaching agreement on a new tariff. If within three (3) months of the date of this Decision, the Parties have been unable to reach agreement on that tariff, they are to report to the Tribunal either jointly or separately on their final positions in the discussions and the reasons underlying those positions. The Tribunal will then decide, in consultation with the Parties, whether a further hearing on recalculation is necessary.\n\n**3. The question of quantum**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) The Disallowed Costs issue**\n---------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nIn 2001 and 2003, IPTL restructured its loans with its senior lenders.339 This was done, SCB HK claims, in order to ensure that commercial operation of the plant could commence. Following receipt of tariff payments from TANESCO after the commencement of commercial operations, IPTL proceeded to pay down these restructured loans in accordance with their terms. Thus, IPTL did not pay down the senior debt in the way contemplated in the ICSID award model.\n\n*Supra* paras. 52-56.\n\n345.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the restructuring of the loans was without the knowledge of TANESCO and that this constituted a breach of the PPA. Moreover, the fact that IPTL was paying Wartsila and Mechmar to cover amounts that had been disallowed by the ICSID I tribunal had the effect of slowing the rate at which the senior debt was being paid down and increasing the amount owing by TANESCO. This, too, the Respondent argued, was a breach of the terms of the PPA.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent\u2019s arguments on the \"disallowed costs\" issue. First, the restructuring of the loans was a matter between IPTL and its creditors, not a matter that fell under the PPA and hence could not constitute a breach of the PPA. Second, the \"disallowed costs\" had been excluded from calculating the tariff under the ICSID award model and the obligation of TANESCO was to pay the tariff as calculated in that model. What IPTL did with the funds it received from the tariff payments had no impact on what TANESCO owed under the PPA.\n\n**(i) Loan restructuring**\n--------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe loans entered into by IPTL to finance the Tegeta project were set out in a series of agreements between IPTL and its senior lenders. These included the Loan Facility Agreement, the Security Deed, the Share Pledge Agreement and the Shareholder Support Deed.340 TANESCO was not a party to any of these agreements. The PPA makes no mention of these agreements, nor does it deal with the way that IPTL was to structure its financing. Indeed, in alleging a breach of the PPA, the Respondent makes no reference to any specific provision of the PPA that has been breached.\n\n*Supra* paras. 37-41.\n\n348.\n\nThe Respondent, instead, focuses on the ICSID award model, which sets out the way in which the tariff payments are structured and includes assumptions about the rate at which the senior debt would be paid down. However, the Tribunal is unable to see how these assumptions about the rate of pay down of the senior debt could have had any effect on the total amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA. They were certainly important in showing how the monthly tariff was constructed, but what was critical in the relations between IPTL and TANESCO was the tariff itself, because it was the payment of the tariff that was TANESCO\u2019s obligation under the PPA.\n\n349.\n\nFurthermore, the assumptions set out in the May 31, 1995 letter from IPTL to the GoT, which the ICSID 1 tribunal incorporated as assumptions built into the PPA, contains no reference to the debt assumed by IPTL apart from stipulating that the ratio of senior debt to equity was to be 70/30. Thus, there is nothing in the May 31, 1995 letter that would suggest that the assumptions for repayment of the senior debt set out in the ICSID award model operated as a contractual obligation between IPTL and TANESCO so that deviations in the structuring of the senior debt (provided it did not change the senior debt/equity ratio) constituted a breach of the PPA.\n\n350.\n\nNor can it be argued that the debt restructuring should have been taken into account in the negotiation of the ICSID award model or the Implementation Model. As pointed out earlier, the debt restructuring took place after the cut-off date of September 1998. And, in any event, the tariff was based on the allowed senior debt as approved by the ICSID 1 tribunal, not on the actual debt that had been assumed by IPTL. As pointed out below, it was the senior debt excluding the disallowed costs that was the basis for the determination of the tariff.\n\n351.\n\nIt is true that the repayment of the new debt taken on by IPTL as a result of the restructuring has resulted in a slowing down of the repayment of the senior debt, but the Tribunal fails to see how this causes any loss to TANESCO. Once TANESCO has completed the tariff payments it is obliged to make under the terms of the PPA, then its obligations to make payments come to an end regardless of whether the senior debt is extinguished or not. As the Claimant pointed out in its PHB, failure to pay down the senior debt results in a loss to IPTL\u2019s shareholders, not to TANESCO.341\n\nCl. PHB, para. 342.\n\n352.\n\nThe Respondent argued that failure to pay down the senior debt created a potential loss for the GoT which in the event of expropriation would be faced with a greater compensation amount. Again, the Tribunal fails to see how this could be a loss to TANESCO. The GoT is not a party to these proceedings and it is only loss to TANESCO that is relevant.\n\n353.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent\u2019s argument that IPTL\u2019s restructuring of its loans constituted a breach of the PPA.\n\n**(ii) Payment of Disallowed Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that the payment by IPTL of costs incurred by Wartsila and Mechmar that had been disallowed by the ICSID 1 tribunal also constituted a breach of the PPA and results in TANESCO having to pay what the ICSID 1 tribunal had said that it did not have to pay. In effect, the Respondent argued, it is having to pay twice.342\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 181, lines 17-18.\n\n355.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal disallowed certain costs incurred by IPTL in the construction of the Tegeta plant, which it concluded had not been prudently incurred.343 This had the effect of reducing the amount of senior debt recoverable from TANESCO from US$89 million to US$85.3 million. The new figure was then used in calculating the tariff that TANESCO had to pay under the ICSID award model.\n\n*Supra* para. 314.\n\n356.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal, then, was concerned with the obligations of TANESCO towards IPTL and vice versa. It was not concerned with, and had no jurisdiction over, the relationship between IPTL and its lenders. As the Claimant pointed out, regardless of the finding of the ICSID 1 tribunal, its obligations to its lenders remained. How it fulfilled those obligations was not a matter regulated by the PPA. If the senior debt expanded, then IPTL\u2019s obligations to its lenders increased, but this was not a matter addressed by the PPA.\n\n357.\n\nNor could an increase in the senior debt have any impact on TANESCO. The obligation of TANESCO was to pay the tariff as set out in the ICSID award model. Any change or increase in the senior debt had no effect on that tariff. The tariff had been set on the basis of the senior debt as allowed by the ICSID 1 tribunal and TANESCO\u2019s obligation was no greater than to pay that tariff. As pointed out earlier, once TANESCO had completed the tariff payments provided for in the ICSID award model, its obligation to make payments would have come to an end. And this was so regardless of whether IPTL had paid off its senior debt. TANESCO only had to pay once; it was not paying twice.\n\n358.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the payments made by IPTL under the restructured debt arrangements, including those payments of costs \"disallowed\" by the ICSID 1 tribunal did not constitute a breach of the PPA and caused no loss to TANESCO.\n\n**b) Exchange rate losses**\n---------------------------\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the loss resulting from IPTL being unable to convert the tariff payments it should have received from TANESCO into US dollars within a short time of receiving those payments was a \"foreseeable\" loss and thus recoverable. The Respondent argues that TANESCO never assumed the risk of such exchange rate losses and in any event such losses are barred by virtue of Article 17.1 of the PPA, which prohibits recovery of \"indirect\" or \"consequential\" losses.\n\n360.\n\nThe PPA itself makes no reference to \"exchange rate losses\", nor is there any provision in the PPA concerning the conversion of tariff payments into US dollars. The Claimant relies on its obligation under the Calculations and Forecasting Agreement with its lenders to transfer such funds into US dollars within two days of their receipt. The provisions of this agreement, the Claimant argues, were known to the Respondent, as was the fact that the ICSID award model makes its calculations in US dollars.\n\n361.\n\nIn the absence of any express agreement to pay for exchange rate losses, the question is whether such losses are foreseeable within the meaning of the English law of remoteness of loss as set out initially in the classic case of *Hadley v. Baxendale.344* In this regard, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s argument that the losses could not be recovered because it was a risk that TANESCO had not assumed.345 Whether a risk has been assumed does not depend on whether it has been expressly assumed by a party. Moreover, exchange rate losses were not expressly excluded in Article 17.1 of the PPA. It is, as the Tribunal has said, a question of remoteness.\n\n(1854) 9 Ex. 341.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent relies on the House of Lords decision in *Transfield Shipping Inc. of Panama v. Mercator Shipping Inc. of Monrovia* [2008] UKHL 48.\n\n362.\n\nAs the Claimant pointed out,346 the test for remoteness has two parts. Under the first limb of the test in *Hadley v. Baxendale* losses *\"arising naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things from [the] breach of contract itself\u2019* can be recovered. Under the second limb losses that *\"may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both**parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it*\"347 can also be recovered.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 554.\n\n(1854) 9 Ex. 341, at 354.\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the exchange rate losses were losses that fell under the first limb - losses that arose naturally from the breach. The first limb, the Claimant says, includes imputed knowledge and each party is \"*taken to understand the ordinary practices and exigencies of the other\u2019s trade or business''348* In the present case, the Claimant argues, where the senior debt had been contributed to by foreign lenders, \"a *reasonable businessman would understand that IPTL would repatriate some or all of the tariff payments in a currency other than Tanzanian shillings''349*\n\nCl. PHB, paras. 554 and 566.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 567.\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that the exchange rate losses here fall under the first limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale.* It cannot agree that the exchange rate losses are losses that would occur in the ordinary course of events or would be \"the natural and probable result\" if the contract were to be breached. Moreover, the Claimant is claiming specifically losses that would result from the inability of IPTL to exchange Tanzanian shillings into US dollars within two business days of the date of receipt of the tariff payments.350 It is unclear how in the absence of specific knowledge a reasonable businessman could contemplate when such a conversion would take place.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 541.\n\n365.\n\nRather, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the claim for foreign exchange losses falls under the second limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale.* Indeed, much of the Claimant\u2019s argument itself reinforces this. The fact that IPTL was to convert Tanzanian shillings into US dollars within two business days of receipt was provided for in the Calculations and Forecasting Agreement between IPTL and its lenders, which TANESCO allegedly was aware of. And the fact that the ICSID award model included repayments in US dollars was also cited as evidence of knowledge of TANESCO that conversion to US dollars would take place. In other words, it is not that exchange rate loss would flow in the ordinary course of events that is the basic argument of the Claimant; it is because of the exigencies of this particular case, which had been brought to the attention of TANESCO. That, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, falls within the second limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale* which encompasses actual knowledge, or knowledge that in the circumstances of the case would be *\"reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it\"351*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 554.\n\n366.\n\nHowever, if exchange rate losses fall within the second limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale,* then by the Claimant\u2019s own admission, they are not recoverable. Article 17.1 of the PPA provides a barrier to recovery. Article 17.1 of the PPA provides that neither party shall be liable for *\"any indirect, consequential, incidental punitive or exemplary damages.\"* In its PHB, the Claimant argues that under English law indirect or consequential damages are *\"losses that are recoverable only under the second limb of the rule in Hadley v Baxendale.\"352*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 565, citing to *Watford Electronics Ltd. v. Sanderson CFL Ltd.* [2001] EWCA Civ 317, para. 43.\n\n367.\n\nSince the Tribunal has concluded that the exchange rate losses are losses that fall under the second limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale,* then Article 17.1 of the PPA prevents their recovery.\n\n**c) Bonus, supplementary and interest payments**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe only issue in contention between the Parties under this heading is the question of bonus payments. As the Respondent clarified at the March 2013 hearing, it limits its disagreement on the question of bonus payments to the time when the plant was in \"nondispatch\" mode.353\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 262, lines 5-11.\n\n369.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the plant was put in \"non-dispatch\" mode because of TANESCO\u2019s failure to make tariff payments.354 Although the Respondent points out that the placing of the plant in \"non-dispatch\" mode resulted from the agreement of IPTL and Wartsila through an amendment to the Suspension Agreement,355 it makes no argument to contradict the Claimant\u2019s contention that the reason for doing this was that TANESCO had ceased to make tariff payments. In short, the claim that the plant was placed in \"non-dispatch\" mode because TANESCO had breached the contract by failing to make tariff payments appears unanswered.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 299.\n\nExh. R-91 (First Amendment to the Suspension Agreement).\n\n370.\n\nIn these circumstances, the question for the Tribunal is whether the loss of bonus payments was a loss that was foreseeable. In the view of the Tribunal, it was. Bonus payments were an entitlement under the PPA provided that certain conditions were met. A breach of contract through a failure to make tariff payments deprived IPTL of the opportunity to receive what it was entitled to receive under the contract, that is the opportunity to receive bonus payments. It is, therefore, a loss that flowed in the ordinary course of things from the breach of the contract, and thus a loss that falls under the first limb of *Hadley v. Baxendale.* And, since it is loss under the first limb, it does not constitute \"indirect\" or \"consequential\" loss and thus does not fall within the scope of Article 17.1 of the PPA.\n\n371.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal is of the view that bonus payments during the period the plant was in \"non-dispatch\" mode are in principle payable, what is less clear is the amount that should be recoverable under this head. The Claimant has asserted an amount based on the assumption that if the plant had been operating then IPTL would have been entitled to the payment of full bonus payments.356 The Respondent has not contradicted the specific amounts claimed. Rather, by focusing on its position that bonus payments are not recoverable, the Respondent has simply not addressed the question of quantum if in fact such payments were to be recoverable.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 595, Invoice No. 02/209 IPTL, 04/2010 IPTL.\n\n372.\n\n**In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the parties should be afforded the opportunity to determine the correct amount of the bonus payments.** They are in the position to determine whether bonus payments were made each time in the past when the plant was operating, or whether the operation of the plant resulted in bonus payments for only a certain percentage of the time. With this information they would be in a position to determine the likelihood that bonus payments would have been made if the plant had not been in \"non-dispatch\" mode and then use that as a basis for calculating the amount that is recoverable.\n\n373.\n\nAccordingly, during the time set aside for the Parties to agree on the recalculation of the tariff, the Parties are also directed to attempt to agree on the amount recoverable for bonus payments that would have been payable if the plant had not been in non-dispatch mode. As in the case of tariff recalculation, if the Parties are unable to agree within the stipulated time they are to report to the Tribunal either jointly or separately on their final positions in the discussions and the reasons underlying those positions.\n\n**d) Enforcement costs**\n------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe claims for enforcement costs are claims made under the Facility Agreement. TANESCO is not a party to that agreement, and this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over it. The claims would be relevant only if the Tribunal were prepared to consider the claim that SCB HK has in respect of IPTL. However, as pointed out earlier,357 the Tribunal is not in a position to consider amounts claimed in relation to an entity that is not a party to these proceedings and in respect of amounts that the Tribunal is unable to verify. Thus, the Tribunal will not include enforcement costs in any declaration it makes about the amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA.\n\n*Supra* paras. 244-245.\n\n**e) Payments made to the Provisional Liquidator**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimant argues that TANESCO cannot deduct from what it is owing to SCB HK monies paid to the PL under the Interim PPA. In the Claimant\u2019s view, these were monies paid under a separate contract to which SCB HK was not a party and this could not affect the rights that SCB HK has to the tariff payments. The Respondent, by contrast, took the view that it could not be required to pay twice for the operation of the plant when it was in the hands of the PL.\n\n376.\n\nThe Parties were never entirely clear on how much was in fact paid to the PL and what it was intended to cover.358 It is clear that a substantial amount of those payments went to the operation and maintenance of the plant. In any event, in the view of the Tribunal, the issues of principle are clear. SCB HK, as the assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights, is entitled to a declaration of the loss IPTL has suffered as a result of TANESCO\u2019s failure to make tariff payments, but that declaration cannot include expenses that IPTL did not incur. Those fall into the category of expenditure saved rather than loss suffered.\n\nTr. March 14, 2013, page 211, lines 7-14, page 245, lines 2-16, and page 266, lines 11-23.\n\n377.\n\nIn the present case, SCB HK is entitled to recover the tariff payments due during the period when the plant was being operated by the PL, which will include capacity charges and bonus payments, less the amount that covered the operation and maintenance of the plant, which were expenses that were not incurred by IPTL in whose shoes SCB HK stands. The Tribunal does not have before it an accurate figure for this amount and thus it is an additional matter for the Parties to attempt to resolve themselves before the Tribunal issues its Award.\n\n**IX. Costs**\n-------------\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal will determine the question of costs at a later stage.\n\n**X. Disposition**\n------------------\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute but its jurisdiction is limited to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO under the PPA.\n\n**B. Merits**\n-------------\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the tariff must be recalculated to reflect the fact that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was by way of shareholder loan and not by way of paid up share capital.\n\n381.\n\nThe Tribunal orders the Parties to attempt to agree on the recalculation of the tariff taking into account the considerations set out by the Tribunal in paras. 337-343 *supra* as well as all other conclusions reached in this Decision. If within three (3) months of the date of this Decision the Parties have been unable to reach agreement on the tariff they are to report to the Tribunal either jointly or separately on their final positions in the discussions and the reasons underlying those positions.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that restructuring of IPTL\u2019s loans did not constitute a breach of the PPA and TANESCO has no claim in this regard.\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the exchange rate losses claimed by the Claimant are not recoverable by virtue of Article 17.1 of the PPA.\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that bonus payments for the period the plant was placed in \"nondispatch\" mode are recoverable.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal orders the Parties to attempt to agree on the amount recoverable for bonus payments that would have been payable if the plant had not been in non-dispatch mode taking into account the considerations set out by the Tribunal in paras. 368-372 *supra* as well as all other conclusions reached in this Decision. If within three (3) months of the date of this Decision the Parties have been unable to reach agreement on the amount recoverable for bonus payments they are to report to the Tribunal either jointly or separately on their final positions in the discussions and the reasons underlying those positions.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant\u2019s \"enforcement costs\" are not recoverable.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that tariff payments payable during the period of the operation of the plant by the Provisional Liquidator are recoverable, less any monies paid for operation and maintenance costs.\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal orders the Parties to determine in accordance with paras. 375-377 *supra,* the amount recoverable for payments made to the Provisional Liquidator. If with three (3) months of the date of this Decision the Parties have been unable to reach agreement on the amount recoverable representing payments made to the Provisional Liquidator they are to report to the Tribunal either jointly or separately on their final positions in the discussions and the reasons underlying those positions.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal reserves its decision as to the costs of the arbitration to a later stage."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-09-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms** |\n| Addendum No. 1 | Addendum No. 1 to the PPA dated June 9, 1995 (Exhs.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case originates from a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated March 18, 1965 (the \"ICSID Convention\"), arising out of a Power Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 1995 (the \"PPA\"), entered into by Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited, the Respondent in this proceeding, and Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (\"SCB HK\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong with its principal place of business in 32nd Floor, Standard Chartered Bank Building, 4-4a Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong. It is a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank (\"SCB\"), which is incorporated in the United Kingdom.\n\n3.\n\nThe claim is brought on the basis of the arbitration clause contained in the PPA which refers to ICSID arbitration. The Claimant brought its claim in its capacity of Security Agent as assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights, further to the occurrence of an event of default under IPTL\u2019s loan. SCB HK originally requested, *inter alia,* from the Tribunal a declaration that TANESCO owed it outstanding payments under the PPA in the sum of US$ 258.7 million or alternatively a declaration that it owed it a sum sufficient to discharge SCB HK\u2019s loan to IPTL in full, and an order to pay US$ 138 million to discharge its loan or alternatively to pay the amount under the PPA.1\n\nSCB HK\u2019s request for relief, Cl. PHB, para. 611, and *see* the Tribunal\u2019s position on the various requests put forward by the Claimant (Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability dated February 12, 2014, paras. 195-199).\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent, the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (\"TANESCO\" or the \"Respondent\"), is an entity wholly owned by the United Republic of Tanzania (\"Tanzania\" or the \"GoT\") and designated as an agency of Tanzania pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. TANESCO\u2019s address is P.O. Box 9024, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Oversight of TANESCO is exercised through the Ministry of Energy and Minerals.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above.\n\n6.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability of February 12, 2014 (the \"Decision\"), the Tribunal decided that IPTL\u2019s rights had been validly assigned to SCB HK under the PPA and that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the Parties and the dispute.2 It specified that it lacked jurisdiction over the relationship between SCB HK and IPTL which arises under the Facility Agreement.3 The Tribunal considered that Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed between IPTL and Sime Bank (the then Security Agent) created a charge over future book debts and thus had to be registered pursuant to Section 79 of Tanzania\u2019s Companies Ordinance, but that the arbitration agreement in Article 18.3 of the PPA was severable from the charge on future book debts, and therefore did not need to be registered. Therefore, the issue of registration of the assignment under Tanzanian law was irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.4 The Tribunal limited its decision to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to IPTL under the PPA.5\n\nDecision, para. 191.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 244.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 244.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 241.\n\n7.\n\nAs to issues of liability, the Tribunal found that:6\n\n\u2022 The tariff should be recalculated to reflect the fact that IPTL\u2019s 30% equity contribution was not in the form of paid-up share capital but by way of shareholder loan. The Tribunal gave some guidance to the Parties in this respect;\n\n\u2022 The restructuring of IPTL\u2019s loans did not constitute a breach of the PPA and TANESCO has no claim in this regard;\n\n\u2022 The exchange rate losses claimed by the Claimant were not recoverable by virtue of Article 17.1 of the PPA;\n\n\u2022 The bonus payments for the period the plant was placed in \"non-dispatch\" mode were recoverable;\n\n\u2022 The Claimant\u2019s \"enforcement costs\" were not recoverable;\n\n\u2022 The tariff payments payable during the period of the operation of the plant by the Provisional Liquidator were recoverable, less any monies paid for operation and maintenance costs.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 381-388.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal directed the Parties to attempt to agree on the tariff recalculation, the amount recoverable for bonus and the amount recoverable for payments made to IPTL\u2019s Provisional Liquidator. The Parties had three months to report to the Tribunal. As it will be explained below, the Parties could not reach an agreement.\n\n**II. Procedural History**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe procedural history of this case has already been described in detail in the Decision.7 For the sake of convenience, the Tribunal will recall below the key steps in these proceedings that are relevant to this Award and will describe the procedural steps that took place after the Decision.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 5-20.\n\n10.\n\nOn August 24, 2012, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction and the merits (\"Resp. CM.\"). On November 7, 2012, the Claimant filed a Reply on jurisdiction and the merits dated October 26, 2012 (amended on November 7, 2012), which was subsequently re-amended on November 22, 2012 (\"Cl. Rep.\"). On November 21, 2012, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on jurisdiction and the merits (\"Resp. Rej.\").\n\n11.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits took place at the IDRC in London from December 3 to 6, 2012, and from December 10 to 11, 2012 (the \"December Hearing\").\n\n12.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs on February 19, 2013 (\"PHB\").\n\n13.\n\nAt the close of the December Hearing, the Parties agreed to hold a further hearing, and such a hearing on the issue of bifurcation, jurisdiction and the merits took place at the IDRC in London, on March 14 and 15, 2013 (the \"March Hearing\").\n\n14.\n\nOn November 27, 2013, the Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal urging it to render the Decision at its earliest convenience and updating the Tribunal on the latest developments in the Tanzanian courts.8 Subsequently, Claimant and Respondent exchanged numerous communications on the same subject during December 2013, including a letter from counsel for Respondent dated December 13, 2013 (the \"December 13, 2013 Letter\"),9 on which the Claimant relies in this phase of the arbitration.\n\nExh. C-311 (Letter from Claimant\u2019s counsel to the Tribunal dated November 27, 2013).\n\nExh. C-313 (The \"December 13, 2013 Letter\").\n\n15.\n\nOn February 12, 2014, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. The Decision forms an integral part of this Award and is incorporated herewith save in respect of certain matters that the Tribunal will revisit in this Award. A copy of the Decision is attached herewith.\n\n16.\n\nIn its Decision, the Tribunal directed the Parties to attempt to agree on various items. In the absence of an agreement after three months from the issuance of the Decision, the Parties were instructed to report by May 12, 2014, to the Tribunal either jointly or separately on their final positions.\n\n17.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, the Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal providing further updates on the developments in Tanzania and the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to engage in negotiations to recalculate the tariff.\n\n18.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, Hunton & Williams, counsel for the Respondent since November 2007, informed the Tribunal that they were no longer in a position to represent the Respondent in these proceedings. Thereafter, correspondence for the Respondent was received from TANESCO.\n\n19.\n\nOn April 28, 2004, the Respondent\u2019s Managing Director submitted a copy of an interim injunction issued by the Tanzanian High Court, i.e. Miscellaneous Application No. 174 on April 23, 2014 against the Parties. The injunction was issued in the context of an application dated April 4, 2014, submitted by IPTL and Pan Africa Power Solutions (T) Limited (\"PAP\") before the High Court of Tanzania seeking, *inter alia,* a restraining order against TANESCO, Ms. Martha Renju in her capacity as the administrative receiver (the \"Administrative Receiver\") of IPTL, and SCB HK from \"doing anything towards enforcing/complying with ICSID preliminary award,\" which was allegedly obtained by fraud.10 The application was granted on an *ex parte* basis on April 23, 2014, by Judge Hon. Twaib in order to maintain the *status quo.* The Judge enjoined the parties from \"doing anything towards enforcing, complying with or operationalizing the preliminary award, pending hearing and final determination of the application.\"11 The injunction was continued by a decision of September 30, 2014.12 According to the Claimant, that injunction remains in force and is not subject to any right of appeal, or revision.13\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 74. Exh. C-350 (Plaint of IPTL and PAP dated April 4, 2014).\n\nExh. C-351 (Injunction dated April 23, 2014).\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 79. Exh.

Tariff Sub., para. 82.\n\n20.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, TANESCO\u2019s Secretary submitted a letter to the Tribunal informing it that the engagement agreement with their previous legal team had expired and seeking an extension to the Tribunal\u2019s proposed timeline pending final determination of the local judge further to the injunction.14\n\nExh. R-159 (Respondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated May 7, 2014).\n\n21.\n\nOn May 12, 2014, TANESCO\u2019s Managing Director informed the Tribunal that Crax Law Partners in association with R. K. Rweyongeza & Co. Advocates and Kellerhals Anwalte Attorneys at Law had been retained as its new counsel in these proceedings.\n\n22.\n\nOn May 19, 2014, counsel for the Claimant indicated by email that its client was \"considering\" the injunctions mentioned above and \"will respond further once it has done so.\"\n\n23.\n\nOn November 11, 2014, the Claimant filed a submission on tariff and accompanying expert report of Lord Hoffmann as well as a second expert report by Colin Johnson with exhibits C-311 through C-362 (\"Cl. Tariff Sub.\"). On November 12, 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its observations on Claimant\u2019s submission by December 15, 2014.\n\n24.\n\nOn December 10, 2014, the new counsel for the Respondent submitted \"Procedural Motions\" requesting, *inter alia,* a copy of the file and an extension of the time limit for the submission of its observations on the Claimant\u2019s Tariff Submission. Counsel indicated that the Respondent had concluded that it was in its best interests to participate in the proceedings despite the Tanzania court injunctions.15\n\nProcedural Motions on behalf of Respondent dated December 10, 2014, page 4.\n\n25.\n\nAfter reviewing the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal decided to grant the extension until February 13, 2015.\n\n26.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, the Respondent submitted its submission on tariff and first accompanying expert report from James Nicholson with exhibits R-159 through R-174 (\"Resp. Tariff Sub.\").\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated February 19, 2015, the Tribunal set a schedule for the second round of submissions, which was extended upon the Parties\u2019 respective requests. Accordingly, on March 26, 2015, the Claimant filed its Reply on tariff and accompanying third expert report of Colin Johnson with exhibits C-363 through C-405 (\"Cl. Tariff Rep.\").\n\n28.\n\nOn May 21, 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on tariff and second expert report of James Nicholson with exhibits R-175 through R-192 (\"Resp. Tariff Rej.\"). In its submission, the Respondent introduced a request for a preliminary ruling on the issue of reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.16\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., paras. 133-134.\n\n29.\n\nOn February 11, 2015, ICSID received an unsolicited letter from VIP Engineering and Marketing Ltd\u2019s (\"VIP\") Dutch counsel. In accordance with the Parties\u2019 past agreement,17 the letter was first transmitted to the Parties and to the Tribunal on March 2, 2015, following the Respondent\u2019s request of February 27, 2015. VIP\u2019s counsel raised SCB HK\u2019s alleged misrepresentations in this case, including its IPTL creditor status, and mentioned various legal proceedings in Tanzania, New York and England. SCB HK replied to those allegations in its Reply on tariff.\n\n*See* Decision, para. 14: *\"The Parties informed the Centre and the Tribunal on September 13, 2012, that they had agreed that unsolicited communications from third parties were to be first sent to the Parties for consultation as to whether such communications should be forwarded to the Tribunal and that either Party could, at any time, request the Secretariat to forward the document to the Tribunal. \"*\n\n30.\n\nIn April 2015, in consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal decided to set aside three days for a hearing in London during August 19-21, 2015.\n\n31.\n\nOn June 29, 2015, the Claimant submitted to the Tribunal a motion to compel the production of certain documents and exhibits from the Respondent, and further submitted exhibits C-406 through C-408.\n\n32.\n\nOn June 30, 2015, the Claimant submitted a copy of an English High Court judgment of Justice Flaux dated June 9, 2015, in a case initiated under the Facility Agreement by SCB HK (as Security Agent) and SCB Malaysia Berhad (as Facility Agent) against IPTL, PAP and VIP in light of numerous references in the Parties\u2019 submissions to this case.18\n\nExh. C-409 (English High Court Judgment dated June 9, 2015).\n\n33.\n\nOn July 2, 2015, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone conference with the Parties. The Respondent reiterated its request made in its submission of May 21, 2015, that the Tribunal make a preliminary ruling on the issue of reconsideration of its decision referring to its lack of jurisdiction to make an award for payment in favour of the Claimant.\n\n34.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 13 dated July 3, 2015, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s request to make a preliminary ruling on the issue of reconsideration and indicated that this issue would be addressed at the hearing scheduled in August 2015. The Tribunal further decided on the schedule to brief the Claimant\u2019s motion to compel documents dated June 29, 2015.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter dated July 13, 2015, the Respondent submitted its observations objecting to the production of the documents. On July 16, 2015, the Claimant submitted further observations in response to the Respondent\u2019s letter to which the Respondent replied on the same date.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter dated July 20, 2015, the Claimant provided the Parties\u2019 agreed proposal regarding the hearing bundle.\n\n37.\n\nBy email dated July 31, 2015, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal was agreeable to the Parties\u2019 agreed proposal regarding the hearing bundle.\n\n38.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, the Centre acknowledged receipt of one USB device containing an electronic copy of the Parties\u2019 hearing bundles, including the Claimant\u2019s exhibits C-409 through C-413 relating to the proceedings brought by SCB HK in the English High Court against IPTL, PAP and VIP.\n\n39.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 14 dated July 20, 2015, the Tribunal granted the Claimant\u2019s motion to compel. The Tribunal directed the Respondent to produce the requested documents pertaining to the tariffs by August 3, 2015. In turn, the Claimant was directed to submit any document that it wanted produced to the Tribunal by August 10, 2015.\n\n40.\n\nOn August 10, 2015, the Claimant submitted documents which it intended to rely on at the hearing further to the Respondent\u2019s document production, namely exhibits C-414 through C-416.\n\n41.\n\nA hearing on tariff recalculation took place at IDRC in London from August 19, 2015, to August 21, 2015 (the \"August Hearing\").

In the same letter, the Claimant also reiterated its request for the Tribunal to order the production of the August 2014 Letter.\n\n46.\n\nBy email dated September 29, 2015, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant\u2019s letter of September 23, 2015, by October 2, 2015.\n\n47.\n\nBy letter dated October 2, 2015, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimant\u2019s letter of September 23, 2015.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter dated October 5, 2015, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce by October 12, 2015 the documents listed in paragraph (i) of the schedule to the Claimant\u2019s letter of September 23, 2015. The Tribunal denied the Claimant\u2019s request formulated in paragraph (ii) of its aforementioned letter.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter dated October 12, 2015, the Respondent produced documents in response to the Tribunal\u2019s order of October 5, 2015, namely exhibits R-207 through R-215. The Respondent also provided legible copies of its previously produced documents (exhibits R-205 and R-206).\n\n50.\n\nBy letter dated October 14, 2015, the Claimant requested the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on its request for the production of the August 2014 letter contained in its letter of September 11, 2015.\n\n51.\n\nBy email dated October 19, 2015, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant\u2019s letter of October 14, 2015, by October 22, 2015.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter dated October 22, 2015, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimant\u2019s letter of October 14, 2015.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter dated October 26, 2015, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce the August 2014 letter.\n\n54.\n\nBy letter dated October 28, 2015, the Respondent produced to the Claimant the August 2014 letter.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter dated October 29, 2015, the Claimant proposed that the August 2014 letter be numbered as the Claimant\u2019s exhibit C-417.\n\n56.\n\nOn November 2, 2015, the Parties filed simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs (\"PHB2\"). The Claimant\u2019s PHB2 was accompanied by a fourth Supplemental Report of Colin Johnson (updating the sums due from TANESCO up to September 2015) and exhibits C-417 and C-418 and legal authority CLA-95. The Respondent\u2019s PHB2 was accompanied by legal authority RLA-86.\n\n57.\n\nOn November 16, 2015, the Claimant filed its costs submission, along with exhibits C-419 through C-430 and legal authorities CLA-96 through CLA-99 (\"Cl. Costs Sub.\"). On the same day, the Respondent filed its costs submission (\"Resp. Costs Sub.\"). On December 22, 2015, the Claimant filed its reply costs submission, along with exhibits C-431 through C-445 (\"Cl. Reply Costs Sub.\"). On the same day, the Respondent filed its reply costs submission, along with exhibits R-218 and R-219 (\"Resp.

Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30).\n\n60.\n\nBy letter dated March 24, 2016, the Tribunal stated that while it did not wish to receive additional submissions from the Parties on the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* case, it invited the Respondent to submit any observations it may have by March 31, 2016.\n\n61.\n\nBy letter dated April 7, 2016, further to time extension, the Respondent provided its observations on the Claimant\u2019s letter of March 22, 2016.\n\n62.\n\nBy letter dated June 6, 2016, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed.\n\n**III. Factual Background**\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal will recall the factual background to this dispute, as it emerged from the Parties\u2019 submissions before the Tribunal\u2019s Decision and as it has emerged since from their latest submissions.\n\n64.\n\nAs will be further elaborated upon below, the Tribunal was not aware of two important developments occurring in 2013 at the time it rendered its Decision. First, 30% of IPTL\u2019s shareholding belonging to VIP had been sold to PAP and 70% of IPTL\u2019s shareholding belonging to Mechmar had also been acquired by PAP, the result of which is that IPTL\u2019s affairs have been transferred to PAP. Second, the tariff dispute between IPTL and TANESCO had been settled and the amounts in the Escrow Account had been released to PAP.\n\n**A. The PPA and related agreements - 1995 - 1998**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nOn May 26, 1995, TANESCO and IPTL entered into the PPA, whereby IPTL agreed to design, construct, own, operate and maintain an electricity generating facility with a nominal net capacity of 100 megawatts, to be located in Tegeta, Tanzania. Pursuant to the PPA, and a related Implementation Agreement,19 which included a guarantee, executed between IPTL and the GoT, IPTL was to deliver electricity generated by the plant to TANESCO for a period of 20 years. The power plant was designed to work only at times of peak demand and has not been running on a continuous basis.20 The applicable law under the PPA is Tanzanian law.\n\nExhs. C-28/R-90 (Implementation Agreement dated June 8, 1995).\n\nRfA, para. 18.\n\n66.\n\nThe financial assumptions for the project were that the projected cost was US$ 163.5 million; the debt/equity ratio was 70% senior debt and 30% equity; the amortization for the 70% senior debt was 7 years (later changed to 8 years in 1998) and the internal rate of return on equity was 23% (later corrected to 22.31% by agreement of the parties after the ICSID 1 award).21 These assumptions, which were adopted by the ICSID 1 tribunal, were reflected in a letter from IPTL to the GoT dated May 31, 199522 The May 31, 1995 letter stated in relevant part:\n\nWe refer to our telephone conversation of yesterday and hereby wish to confirm that the following assumptions used to determine the capacity charge are contained in the MECHMAR proposal submitted to the Government in November 1994 which was the basis of negotiations and agreements reached in January, 1995.\n\n1) Project Cost US$ 163.5 million (1994)\n\n2) Senior Debt 70%\n\n3) Equity 30%\n\n4) Aggregate Interest Rate for Senior Debt 10,940%\n\n5) Amortisation 7 years\n\n6) Tax Holiday 5 years\n\n7) Capacity Factor 85%\n\n8) Levelized Discount Rate 10%\n\n9) Fixed Operating Costs/Ycar US$ 4.3 million\n\n10) Hours in the Year 8,760\n\n11) IRR 23%\n\n12) Degraded Heat Rate (BTU/kWhHHV) 8,913\n\nYou will notice that the main factor which can alter the capacity charge is the Total Project cost item of US$ 163.5 million and we have made a provision in the agreement with TANESCO that any changes in the stated assumptions will result in adjustments in the Reference Tariff proportionately.\n\nAt the moment the PPA is talking about the Reference Tariff and not the Final Tariff and we agreed with the Minister and the Principal Secretary before they left for Canada that in view of the clarifications we provided you would seek the approval of State House so that we sign the PPA immediately as directed by the Cabinet but mentioning the Reference Tariff.\n\nYou know very well that the process of negotiations with the Banks for the Debt Financing component takes between 4-6 months and we have already lost 5 months since January, 1995 when we completed negotiations waiting for the PPA to be signed. We request you to authorise TANESCO to sign the PPA now mentioning the Reference Tariff so that we can take the documents to the Banks for debt negotiations and any justifiable changes can be done by way of side memoranda or addendum to the Agreement.\n\n[...]\n\nResp. CM., para. 3.\n\nExh. C-38 (IPTL\u2019s letter dated May 31, 1995).\n\n67.\n\nThe financial models used by IPTL at the time in order to structure the financing for the project, including the 1995 Model (the \"1995 Financial Model\"),23 were not provided to TANESCO.24 It has also been argued that a model developed by IPTL in May 1998 (the \"1998 Financial Model\"),25 was not provided to TANESCO.\n\nExh. R-99 (1995 Financial Model).\n\nCl. PHB, para. 43.\n\nExh. R-98 (1998 Financial Model).\n\n68.\n\nInitially, there had been an agreement on a fixed price contract, but in Addendum No. 1 to the PPA, dated June 9, 1995 (\"Addendum No. 1\"), a new basis for calculating the Reference Tariff in the PPA was provided, as follows: \"Before commencement of commercial operations the Reference Tariff [...] will be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the effect of changes that will have taken place on any or all the underlying assumptions stated in the Power Purchase Agreement.\"26\n\nExh. C-39 (Addendum No. 1 to the PPA dated June 9, 1995).\n\n69.\n\nPayments (capacity and energy payments, supplemental charges, bonus payments, as well as interest on overdue payments) under the PPA were to be made to IPTL on a monthly basis for a term of 20 years. Capacity payments and energy payments to be made after the commencement of commercial operation, which constituted the \"Reference Tariff,\" had been computed on the basis of assumptions mentioned in the appendices of the PPA.27\n\nResp. PHB, para. 20. Exhs. C-4/R-1 (PPA), Art. 5.1 and 1.1. *See* AppendixB to the PPA.\n\n70.\n\nIPTL had been formed in 1994 by Mechmar, a Malaysian corporation, and VIP, a Tanzanian company. VIP held 30% of the shares of IPTL, and Mechmar held the remaining 70%.28 IPTL\u2019s authorized share capital was US$ 10 million and its paid up share capital was equivalent to US$ 100.29\n\nCl.

The loan contemplated a debt/equity ratio of 70/30.32\n\nBank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad (BBMB) as arranging bank and facility agent, Sime Bank Berhad as security agent and arranging bank, BBMB International Bank (L) Limited and Sime International Bank (L) Limited both as lenders, Cl.

Exh. C-43 (Exhibits SCB-1 to SCB-9 in the Interpretation Proceedings).\n\n73.\n\nOn June 28, 1997, IPTL entered into a Security Deed (the \"Security Deed\"), with Sime Bank Berhad, which provided security to the lenders, including right, title and interest to various contracts, including the PPA. The Security Deed is governed by English law.34 Under the 1997 Security Deed and the Loan Agreement, Sime Bank Berhad of Malaysia (and later its successors RHB Bank Berhad and Danaharta)35 was appointed as Security Agent.\n\nClause 20.1 of the Security Deed, Exhs. C-16/R-68. Cl. Mem., footnote 32: *\"The Security Deed was between IPTL and Sime Bank Berhad 'in its capacity as Security Agent under the Facility Agreement... which expression includes**any successor appointed as Security Agent' (C-16 at page 486). Clause 22(H) of the Facility Agreement details the procedure for the replacement of Security Agents (C-ll at page 421).\"*\n\nCl. Mem., para. 84(3): *\"The interest of the final original lender, Sime Bank, was transferred to RHB Bank Berhad (\"RHB\") through an order of the High Court of Malaysia dated 29 June 1999 (the \"Vesting Order\").

PHB, para. 34.\n\n75.\n\nOn 28 June 1997, Mechmar and VIP also pledged their shares to the Security Agent under a Charge of Shares (the \"Share Pledge Agreement\")37 as security for the loan.\n\nExh. C-18 (Share Pledge Agreement dated June 28, 1997).\n\n76.\n\nOn the same day, Mechmar and VIP together with IPTL and the Security Agent entered into a shareholder support deed (the \"Shareholder Support Deed\").38 Under the Shareholder Support Deed, the Shareholders\u2019 Funds could be subscribed by way of ordinary shares or the provision of subordinated loans to IPTL.39 The shareholders also undertook not to take any action in furtherance of the winding up, liquidation or dissolution of IPTL.40 Mechmar also undertook specific obligations under the Shareholder Support Deed such as to guarantee to the Security Agent that it would pay any sum payable under the financing agreements if IPTL did not do so.41\n\nExh.

It was disputed whether the equity contribution could be made by way of a subordinated shareholder loan, the Respondent\u2019s position being that this was not permitted. It is undisputed, however, that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was in fact made mostly by way of a shareholder loan, and not by way of subscription for shares.43 According to the Claimant, Mechmar made a loan to IPTL in an amount of US$ 27 million in December 1997, and a further loan of US$ 33 million in December 199844\n\nExh. C-38 (Letter from IPTL to the Ministry of Water, Energy and Minerals dated May 31, 1995), quoted above.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 14, *see also* paras. 63-64.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 54. Resp.

Rej., para. 6.\n\n78.\n\nOn March 12, 1998, the Security Agent, originally Sime Bank Berhad, provided notice to TANESCO that IPTL had assigned the PPA to it as security for the loan provided in the Facility Agreement.45\n\nExh. C-26 (Notice of Assignment dated March 12, 1998).\n\n**B. The earlier ICSID proceedings and the origin of the dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIn 1998, prior to commercial operation, TANESCO submitted to ICSID a request for arbitration against IPTL claiming that it was entitled to terminate the PPA or, alternatively, to obtain a material reduction of the tariff because the cost of the facility was excessive. IPTL submitted a counterclaim against TANESCO for damages. A tribunal composed of Mr. Kenneth S. Rokison, a national of the United Kingdom (President), Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States of America, and Mr. Andrew Rogers, a national of Australia (the \"ICSID 1 tribunal\"), issued an award on July 12, 2001 (the \"ICSID 1 award\").46\n\nExhs. C-10/R-8 *(Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited v. Independent Power Tanzania Limited* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/8), Award dated July 12, 2001 (\"ICSID 1 award\")), also available on the ICSID website.\n\n80.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal decided that TANESCO had no right to terminate the PPA, which was and remained valid, and took note of the Reference Tariff agreed upon by the parties. Based on the tribunal\u2019s initial rulings, the parties had adjusted the financial model that would be used to calculate the capacity and energy tariffs after commercial operation started. That adjusted financial model was submitted to the tribunal pursuant to a \"Stipulation and Agreement\" between TANESCO and IPTL and incorporated into the ICSID 1 award as Appendix F. The ICSID 1 award reduced the cost of the project from US$ 163.5 million to US$ 127.2 million,47 with a senior debt of US$ 89 million (further reduced to US$ 85.3 million)48 and the remainder (approximately US$ 38 million) in equity. The costs that the ICSID 1 tribunal deemed not to have been prudently incurred and that should be disregarded when calculating the tariff, are referred to as the \"Disallowed Costs.\" These costs were to be the sole responsibility of IPTL.\n\nFurther reduced to US$ 121.5 million by agreement of the Parties, Cl. Mem., para. 74. *See* Resp. CM., para. 69.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 86.\n\n81.\n\nAlthough the plant had been completed in 1998, the commercial operation of the facility did not start until January 2002, after the ICSID 1 proceeding. According to the Claimant, the plant had been called upon to generate some electricity during each month from January 2002 to April 2007, as well as in June 2007, in March 2008 and from November 2009 to October 2011.49\n\nCl. Mem., para. 76 indicating that TANESCO did not produce information after October 2011.\n\n82.\n\nHowever, according to the Claimant, TANESCO failed to make the required capacity payments, alleging that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution had been made by way of shareholder loan rather than subscription for shares. It also stopped making the other payments to IPTL due under the PPA as of April 2007.50 An invoice dispute was formally raised on June 17, 2004, by TANESCO.51 It then started making monthly payments into an escrow account (the \"Escrow Account\") established with the Bank of Tanzania.52 Counsel for the Respondent indicated at the March 2013 Hearing that the amount then in that account was about US$ 90 million.53\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 173.\n\nResp. PHB, paras. 76 and *seq.*\n\nResp. CM., para. 124.\n\nMr. Range, Tr. March 15, 2013, page 124, line 13. Exh. C-106 (Bank of Tanzania Statement of account dated November 23, 2011, Tegeta Escrow Account).\n\n83.\n\nIn June 2008, IPTL filed with ICSID an application for interpretation of the ICSID 1 award.54 The ICSID 1 tribunal was recomposed for an interpretation proceeding and reconstituted following the resignation of Judge Charles Brower. The Members of the tribunal were Messrs. Rokison, Rogers and Mr. Makhdoom Ali-Khan, a national of Pakistan.\n\nExh. C-12 (Request for interpretation dated June 19, 2008 filed by Nixon Peabody). Both Parties seem to agree that it was at the time the short lived administrator of IPTL who authorized the proceeding, and not the Provisional Liquidator, *see* Tr. March 15, 2013, page 88.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it was Mechmar who had made the application for interpretation on behalf of IPTL, without securing first VIP\u2019s authorization or the authorization of IPTL\u2019s Provisional Liquidator.55 SCB HK sought to intervene in that proceeding as assignee under the PPA but its intervention was not accepted.56\n\nResp. PHB, para. 96. *See* Section E below for the details on IPTL\u2019s liquidation.\n\nCl. Mem., para. 116. Mr. Weiniger, Tr. March 15, 2013, page 128, lines 7-10: *\"The simplest explanation is that under the ICSID rules, only a party can bring interpretation proceedings, and the Bank was not a party. \"* Mr. Range, Tr. March 15, 2013, pages 133, lines 24-25, page 134, lines 1-4: *\"The reason why that ended the way it did is that they decided [...] to give up their application to intervene in the interpretation proceedings because they were informed, accurately, that IPTL had decided to discontinue the interpretation proceeding.\"*\n\n85.\n\nThe ICSID 1 tribunal issued an order for discontinuance of the case on August 19, 2010, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 44.57 The Respondent contends that Mechmar requested the discontinuance, while the Claimant argues that it was the Provisional Liquidator who made the request.58\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 44 \"Discontinuance at Request of a Party\" reads as follow: *\"If a party requests the discontinuance of the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall in an order fix a time limit within which the other party may state whether it opposes the discontinuance.

The IPTL\u2019s debt restructurings - 2001 - 2003**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Parties do not agree on the consequences of the ICSID 1 award in respect of the amounts due to IPTL\u2019s lenders. It is not disputed, however, that in 2001 and 2003, a refinancing of the 1997 Loan Agreement took place.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in 2001, Mechmar, purporting to act in IPTL\u2019s name, and Danaharta Managers (L) Ltd. (\"Danaharta\")62 - a Malaysian governmental institution created to remove non-performing loans from the Malaysian financial system - replaced the 1997 Loan Agreement with two new loans (\"Term Loans 1 and 2\") and extended the amortization period from 8 years to 10 years.63 The Respondent maintains that TANESCO had no knowledge of this restructuring. The new loans amounted to over US$ 120 million, which was more than the senior debt authorized by the ICSID 1 award, and allegedly included penalty interest that had accrued on the original Loan Agreement prior to the commencement of commercial operations.64\n\nDanaharta was previously Sime International Bank (L) Limited, one of the original lenders. It changed its name in January 2009. *See* Cl. Mem., para. 84.\n\nResp. CM., paras. 94 and *seq.,* para. 118. Resp. PHB, paras. 65 and *seq.*\n\nResp. CM., para. 92.\n\n89.\n\nIn addition, according to the Respondent, in May 2001, Mechmar obtained a short-term loan from Danaharta in the amount of US$ 5.2 million, which was repaid by October 2002, as it had been ranked in priority to other loans extended to IPTL, including the senior debt.65\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 93.\n\n90.\n\nFurthermore, the operations and management contractor responsible for constructing the facility, Wartsila, obtained through an alleged \"secret side-deal\" a loan from Danaharta for US$ 32 million, which also had higher priority than the other loans extended to IPTL, including the senior debt.66\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 95 and *seq.* Resp. PHB, paras. 70 and *seq.*\n\n91.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, all of this altered the waterfall of payments with the final result that IPTL paid down the senior debt more slowly than agreed, with 13.3% paid down in the first three years instead of 60%.67 The Claimant does not dispute the restructuring or the new loans but claims that the changed waterfall of payments resulted in the senior lender being paid off more quickly.68\n\nResp. CM., para. 103.\n\nCl. Rep., para. 184.\n\n**D. The SCB HK\u2019s involvement - 2005 onwards**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nIt is not disputed by the Parties that, by 2005, Danaharta was the sole lender under the Facility Agreement.69 Further to an auction of distressed debt, in August 2005, SCB HK acquired from Danaharta, for US$ 76.1 million,70 Term Loans 1 and 2, which had a face value of US$ 101.7 million, and became the sole lender to IPTL.71 Under that transaction, SCB HK was assigned a number of contracts, including the 1997 Security Deed, the Implementation Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement concluded between IPTL and the GoT.72\n\n*See* Cl. Mem., para. 84. Sime International Bank (L) Limited changed its name to Danaharta; BBMB International Bank (L) Limited novated its rights to Danaharta as did RHB.\n\nResp. CM., para. 122.\n\nExhs.

C-56/R-114 (Deed of Assignment dated August 17, 2005).\n\n93.\n\nSCB HK also became the Security Agent under the Share Pledge Agreement and the Shareholder Support Deed.73 According to the Claimant, \"[a]s Security Agent, SCB HK holds all of IPTL\u2019s \u2018right, title and interest in and to the Assigned Contracts, including all monies which may at any time be or become payable to the Borrower.\u2019\"74\n\nCl. Mem., para. 87.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 87.\n\n94.\n\nSCB HK became the Security Agent on November 4, 2009.75\n\n*Ibid.,* footnote 79: *\"The original Security Agent, Sime Bank, was succeeded by RHB in 1999. By letter dated 29 October 2009 from SCB HK, RHB was removed as Security Agent (see C-57). SCB HK was appointed as Security Agent on 4 November 2009 and duly accepted such appointment (see C-58). This took place after SCB Malaysia had earlier declined the appointment (see letter to SCB Malaysia dated 29 October 2009 at C-59 and letter from SCB Malaysia to SCB HK at C-60).\" See* Cl. Mem., para. 120 and paras. 210-211.\n\n95.\n\nWhether the assignment was valid has been highly disputed by the Parties and still is. The Tribunal found in its Decision that IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA were validly assigned to SCB HK under the Security Deed.76 Whether the security interest needed to be registered under Tanzania\u2019s Companies Ordinance to be perfected so as to make it effective against third parties was further disputed.\n\nDecision, para. 151.\n\n96.\n\nFrom 2006 onwards, IPTL failed to pay the amounts due towards its interest and principal repayments due under the Loan Agreement. This led to the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement.\n\n97.\n\nUnder Clause 8 of the Security Deed, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement, IPTL is no longer authorized to exercise and enforce the rights, discretions and remedies conferred on it under the PPA. Those rights, discretions and remedies are instead exercisable by the Security Agent acting as agent for and on behalf of the lenders. Subsequent to the occurrence of the event of default, SCK HK exercised the step-in rights conferred on it. It considered IPTL\u2019s contractual rights under the PPA to have been vested in SCB HK.\n\n98.\n\nIn December 2009, IPTL and TANESCO were notified of the occurrence of an event of default by the Facility Agent under the Financing Documents.77 Subsequently, steps were taken to enforce the security interests created by IPTL in favour of the Security Agent, SCB HK.78\n\nExh.

C-25 (Letter from Standard Chartered Bank Malaysia to SCB HK dated December 15, 2009).\n\n99.\n\nIn addition, SCB HK\u2019s charge over the shares pledged by VIP and Mechmar also became enforceable.\n\n**E. The IPTL\u2019s shareholders/creditors and IPTL\u2019s status - 2001 onwards**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Original dispute between the shareholders**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nOn or around 2001, certain disputes arose between the Malaysian majority shareholder of IPTL, Mechmar, and the Tanzanian minority shareholder, VIP.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to the Claimant:\n\nVIP argued that the costs that the ICSID 1 Tribunal had disallowed for the purpose of tariff calculations should not be included in IPTL\u2019s accounts when calculating VIP\u2019s profits to be earned as a shareholder in IPTL. Instead, VIP contended those costs should be counted only against the other shareholder of IPTL, Mechmar. Similarly, VIP contended that the costs associated with the delay in the operation of the Power Plant should be for Mechmar\u2019s account alone, and not counted when calculating the value of VIP\u2019s shares.79\n\nVIP argued that if those costs were removed from the accounts of IPTL and put on the books of Mechmar, then the value of its shares at that point in time would have been US$31,273,783. It asked that Mechmar pay it this amount. Mechmar did not agree. VIP then demanded that Mechmar represent in writing to third parties that VIP\u2019s shares were valued at US$31 million. When Mechmar refused to do so, VIP began a series of actions to *\"strongarm\"* Mechmar into acceding to its wishes.80\n\nCl. Mem., para. 78.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 79.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to the Respondent:\n\nMechmar argued that IPTL should bear all of the disapproved costs, while VIP maintained that only the costs approved by the ICSID 1 Tribunal should be borne by IPTL, and that Mechmar alone should bear the disapproved costs. Mr. Rugemalira believed that Mechmar deliberately inflated project costs, and that therefore all disallowed costs should be assigned to Mechmar and not to IPTL.81\n\nResp. PHB, para. 55. Mr. Rugemalira was the Director of IPTL and author of the May 31, 2005 letter to the GoT.\n\n103.\n\nAs a result of the shareholders\u2019 disagreements, numerous proceedings were launched, including a winding up petition regarding IPTL, and SCB HK became a party to some of those proceedings.\n\n**2. Proceedings regarding or involving IPTL and its current status**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nOn February 25, 2002, VIP petitioned the High Court of Tanzania for the winding up of IPTL.82 VIP also requested various forms of provisional relief, including that the Court appoint a provisional liquidator over IPTL.\n\nExh. R-12 (Petition for Winding up between VIP Engineering and Marketing Limited and Independent Power Tanzania Limited dated February 25, 2002, Clause No. 49 of 2002).\n\n105.\n\nOn November 21, 2008, SCB HK applied to the High Court of Tanzania seeking an order to restrain VIP from continuing with the winding up, which was dismissed by the Court for want of prosecution.\n\n106.\n\nIn December 2008 and January 2009,83 pursuant to its rights under a Charge of Shares of VIP in IPTL dated June 28, 1997, RHB Bank Berhad, acting as security agent for SCB HK, appointed Ms. M. K. Renju as Administrative Receiver over VIP and, later, over Mechmar\u2019s shares.84\n\n*See* facts as described in Exh. C-409 (English High Court Judgment dated June 9, 2015), para. 19.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 27(16). Exh.

A few days later, SCB HK informed the Provisional Liquidator that it held security over IPTL\u2019s assets under the Security Deed.85\n\nCl. Mem., para. 119.\n\n108.\n\nOn January 27, 2009, upon SCB HK\u2019s request made a few days earlier (\"SCB HK\u2019s Administration Petition\"), the High Court of Tanzania appointed *ex parte* an administrator over IPTL (the \"Administrator\"). On the ground that notice should have been issued to all of the interested parties, the appointment of the Administrator was set aside by the Tanzanian Court of Appeal on April 9, 2009.86 SCB HK withdrew its first petition and filed a second petition to appoint an Administrator on September 17, 2009 (\"SCB HK\u2019s Second Administration Petition\").\n\nExhs. C-302/R-152 (Ruling of Tanzanian Court of Appeal in the Revision Proceedings dated December 17, 2012), page 6.\n\n109.\n\nAround October 2009, according to the Claimant, the GoT took control of the power plant, and the Provisional Liquidator and TANESCO entered into an interim PPA on February 5, 2010 (the \"Interim PPA\").87 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he PL has not properly accounted for monies received pursuant to the interim operation of the Plant.

The letter was transmitted to the Parties, who provided their comments to the Tribunal. Commenting on this letter, TANESCO submitted that the Tribunal should stay the proceeding to allow SCB HK to seek a declaration of the validity of its claimed assignment in Tanzanian courts, where the Liquidator could be joined as a party.96\n\nTANESCO\u2019s Comment on Submission of the Liquidator of IPTL dated August, 15, 2012, para. 33.\n\n116.\n\nIn August 2012, ICSID received from VIP a copy of its letters dated July 31, 2012, and August 25, 2012, sent to the Liquidator claiming, *inter alia,* that SCB HK is not a creditor of IPTL. The letters were transmitted to the Parties, who provided their comments to the Tribunal.\n\n117.\n\nOn December 17, 2012, the Court of Appeal in the Civil Revision Proceeding No. 1 vacated all proceedings in the winding-up petition retroactive to July 17, 2009, including the Winding up Order of July 15, 2011, and directed that the matter be considered by the High Court.97 The Court of Appeal decided that the High Court should not have appointed a liquidator in 2011 while SCB HK\u2019s Second Administration Petition to appoint an administrator to IPTL was pending. The Court of Appeal remitted the matter to the High Court for consideration.\n\nExh. R-152 (Order of High Court dated December 17, 2012), page 27. Also Exh.

Civil Cause No. 254 of 2003).101 The Claimant contends that VIP\u2019s application before the Tanzanian High Court was made without notice to SCB HK and that it was not represented at the High Court hearing in Tanzania before Judge Utamwa, which took place on September 3, 2013, and September 5, 2013.102\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 34.

The Respondent argues that it was not a party to the proceedings resulting in the Utamwa J Order and on that basis it is not in a position to address any legal errors arising in that context.108 However, the Respondent submits that to the extent that the respective order had effects beyond the Parties to the proceeding, it could not ignore them.109\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 16.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 16.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent contends that if the Claimant believed the Utamwa J Order to have breached its rights then it should have joined the application for the revision.110 The Claimant counter-argues that it was futile in seeking a further review of the Utamwa J Order because a November Revision application initiated by the Mechmar Liquidators had remained unheard 16 months on.111 Conversely, the Claimant contends that actions brought by VIP and PAP were heard expeditiously.112\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 17.\n\nResp.

R-170 (Ruling order of the High Court (Utamwa J) dated December 6, 2013).\n\n135.\n\nSCB HK explained in its Reply on Tariff that it did so partly because, given that the Provisional Liquidator had been removed, there was no more a threat of winding up, and that SCB HK had lost confidence in the Tanzanian judicial process and did not want them to conclude that the loan was invalid.\n\n136.\n\nIn a letter to the Tribunal of November 27, 2013, SCB HK indicated that there was \"no winding-up petition or substantive administration petition in respect of IPTL pending before the Tanzanian courts, and no prospect of a liquidator or administrator being appointed.\"122 SCB HK further indicated that it had been informed that TANESCO had entered into an agreement with IPTL to settle the outstanding tariff payments under the PPA that are in issue in these proceedings, thereby facilitating release of the funds placed in escrow by the GoT as security for TANESCO\u2019s obligations under the PPA (see below for the details). SCB HK concluded that it was concerned about this deterioration in its position and requested an award as soon as possible.\n\nExh. C-311 (SCB HK\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated November 27, 2013).\n\n137.\n\nIn its Motion to Compel dated June 29, 2015, SCB HK claims that it was in November 2013, unaware of the details concerning the settlement of the outstanding tariff dispute between PAP-controlled IPTL and TANESCO.123\n\nClaimant\u2019s Motion to Compel Production of Documents dated June 29, 2015, para. 8.\n\n138.\n\nTANESCO responded on December 13, 2013,124 noting that SCB HK had not sought to block the sale of VIP\u2019s shareholding to PAP; that the agreement by PAP to sell electricity to TANESCO at reduced tariffs is not a change in practice and is not a deterioration in SCB HK\u2019s position; and that TANESCO had no control over the escrow account agreement whose parties are the GoT, IPTL and Bank of Tanzania.\n\nExh. C-313 (The December 13, 2013 Letter).\n\n139.\n\nTANESCO disagreed with SCB HK that there was no longer any prospect of a liquidator or administrator being appointed over IPTL.

An award was issued on August 26, 2003 (the \"LCIA award\")126 directing VIP to discontinue the winding up proceedings it had initiated against IPTL before the High Court of Tanzania in 2002.

VIP Engineering and Marketing Limited* (LCIA Arbitration No. 2353), Award dated August 26, 2003).\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that there were allegations of various proceedings between SCB and Mechmar in Malaysia and in the British Virgin Islands.\n\n143.\n\nAs mentioned above, on June 28, 1997, further to the occurrence of an event of default, Mechmar and VIP charged their shares in IPTL to the Security Agent, which was to become SCB HK.128 In this phase of the arbitration, the validity of such charge resurfaced in the context of the sale of Mechmar\u2019s shares in IPTL to PAP. SCB HK claims that it had control of the share certificates since 2010.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 19. Exh. C-319 (Letter from Linklaters & Paine to Sime Bank Berhad dated October 1, 1997).\n\n144.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in June 2010, it appeared that the GoT intended to purchase all of the shares in IPTL and that Mechmar was willing to sell its shares in IPTL.129 In response, the Claimant submits that SCB HK communicated to the GoT that (i) the Mechmar\u2019s shares were subject to a charge by SCB HK, (ii) SCB HK had appointed Martha Renju as the Receiver over the shares in IPTL in January 2009,130 and (iii) the GoT would need to acquire the shares through SCB HK.131\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 20.\n\n*Ibid.,* footnote 19.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 20. The Claimant submits that the PAC Report (Exh. C-367) purportedly confirmed its position regarding the enforcement of its rights over the Mechmar shares *(see* Cl. Tariff Rep., paras. 19-20).\n\n145.\n\nOn August 7, 2010, SCB HK sought interim relief from the High Court of Malaysia in response to Mechmar\u2019s plans to sell its IPTL shares.132 On October 4, 2010, the Malaysian Court granted an interlocutory injunction barring Mechmar from transferring its IPTL shares and requiring it to deliver the share certificates to SCB HK.133\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 21.

According to the Due Diligence Report prepared by Mr. Godwin Ngwilimi, TANESCO\u2019s Company Secretary, in 2010 and 2011, Mechmar had sold its shares in IPTL to Piper Link based in the BVI. In this transaction, Piper Link was allegedly represented by Harbinder Sing Sethi. This was hearsay from the Mechmar liquidators. *See* Exh.

Tariff Sub., para. 13.\n\n151.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent disputes the validity of the charge to SCB HK (see below).\n\n152.\n\nOn May 18, 2012, Mechmar went into liquidation in Malaysia and its liquidators assumed control over its assets.142\n\nParties\u2019 respective letters of November 27 and December 13, 2013. Cl.

IPTL is said to have raised a counterclaim.143\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 85(3)\n\n**4. VIP v. SCB and SCB HK**\n----------------------------\n\n154.\n\n*Proceedings in the USA:* In June 2013, in parallel to the actions before the Tanzanian courts, VIP filed an action in the New York State Supreme Court against Standard Chartered Bank (\"SCB\") in Tanzania, not SCB HK, alleging that SCB fraudulently and falsely claimed VIP\u2019s interest in IPTL. SCB removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the \"New York proceedings\") and moved to compel arbitration and to stay or dismiss the action.144\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., para. 54. Cl. Tariff Sub., para. 66.\n\n155.\n\nOn September 10, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the case on *forum non conveniens* grounds.145 On September 23, 2013, the court issued a new order holding that Tanzania represented \"an adequate alternative forum, [...] which the Court deem[ed] an expression of [SCB\u2019s] consent to the adjudication of this action in Tanzania.\"146 Following subsequent submissions by SCB and VIP, on October 4, 2013, the court issued a new order providing that \"[j]udicial estoppel prevents a party from making a contradictory statement in a later stage of litigation based on \u2018the exigencies of the moment\u2019.\"147 SCB appealed the District Court\u2019s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which dismissed SCB\u2019s appeal on December 15, 2014.148\n\nExh.

Standard Chartered Bank,* Case 13-3891-cv, Summary Order dated December 15, 2014), page 2.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, SCB HK was not a party to the New York proceedings and did not make any representation to the New York Court concerning whether the Tanzanian courts were the proper forum for the action. Moreover, the Claimant maintains that SCB did not in fact consent to the jurisdiction of the Tanzanian Court, and the proceedings were dismissed.149\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 21,124.\n\n157.\n\n*Proceedings in Tanzania:* By letter before action of October 12, 2012, counsel for VIP threatened an action against SCB HK.150 On November 13, 2013, VIP filed suit in the High Court in Tanzania against SCB, SCB HK, two Wartsila entities and the Mechmar Liquidators (Civil Case No. 229 of 2013).151 According to the Respondent,152 VIP\u2019s complaint (i) seeks damages for losses it suffered from the unlawful restructuring of IPTL\u2019s debt, (ii) challenges the legality of SCB\u2019s/SCB HK\u2019s alleged purchase of the debt in 2005 from Danaharta, and (iii) seeks a declaration that SCB/SCB HK lacks standing as a valid creditor or as a valid secured creditor of IPTL. The Claimant contends that VIP alleged \"fraud, conversion, waste and negligence\" on the part of the defendants in dealing with the interests of VIP in IPTL. The Parties agree that VIP seeks damages of almost US$ 500 million from the defendants. According to the Claimant, a pre-trial conference took place in Tanzania on March 10, 2015 with the claim allocated to an 18-month track.153\n\nExh.

C-327 (Claim).\n\n160.\n\nOn June 9, 2015, Justice Flaux rendered a judgement in which he dismissed the application by the defendants for a stay of the English proceedings on *forum non conveniens* grounds and VIP\u2019s application for a stay or strike out of the proceedings on the grounds of estoppel or abuse of process.156\n\nExh. C-409 (English High Court Judgment dated June 9, 2015).\n\n**F. PAP\u2019s involvement as of 2013**\n-----------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nPAP is a Tanzanian company controlled by Mr. Harbinder Singh Sethi and, according to the Claimant, was incorporated in October 2011.157\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 31.\n\n162.\n\nPAP is purported to have purchased, on a date that cannot be confirmed, VIP\u2019s 30% shareholding and Mechmar\u2019s 70% shareholding in IPTL - the possibility of which is disputed by SCB HK. In essence, IPTL\u2019s affairs, as well as the Plant, were transferred to PAP in 2013. In the same year, TANESCO paid PAP US$ 201 million. Part of that sum appears to have been taken from the Escrow Account used for the disputed invoices at stake in this case. These facts were unknown to the Tribunal at the time it issued its Decision.\n\n163.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the sequence of these events, relying principally on the Claimant\u2019s allegations, the Respondent having limited itself to rebutting only certain arguments.\n\n**1. The acquisition of VIP\u2019s shareholding in IPTL by PAP**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nOn August 15, 2013, VIP entered into a share purchase agreement for the sale of its 30% shareholding in IPTL to PAP for a value of US$ 75 million (the \"VIP-PAP SPA\").158\n\nExh. C-316 (VIP-PAP SPA). *See also* Exh. C-336 (VIP\u2019s Notice of Withdrawal of the winding up petition dated August 19, 2013). Cl. Tariff Sub., para. 30. The Respondent observes that, on August 11, 2014, the Claimant submitted a claim against VIP in a District Court of the Netherlands requesting the payment of US$ 75 million (Resp. Tariff Sub., para. 77). According to the Claimant, the proceedings in the Netherlands are not relevant for current purposes. It contends that the VIP-PAP SPA provided that the US$ 75 million to be paid by PAP were to be paid into a bank account in the Netherlands and that it requested for a Garnishee Order to preserve the funds. (Cl. Tariff Rep., para. 136). The proceeds for VIP\u2019s shares were purportedly not paid to the relevant banks in the Netherlands, which is why the Claimant\u2019s action was discontinued (Exh. C-397 (Witness Statement of Ewald Cornelis Netten in Claim No. 2013 Folio 697 (redacted) dated October 21, 2014)). The Respondent contends that what the Claimant is seeking to recover in the Netherlands should form part of what it is also seeking to recover from TANESCO in its proceedings before ICSID (Resp. Tariff Sub., para 59).\n\n165.\n\nThe VIP-PAP SPA was countersigned by IPTL\u2019s Provisional Liquidator, whom the Claimant contends was corrupt and has been since arrested and charged.159 The Claimant further alleges that Tanzania acted as broker in that sale.160 Conversely, the Respondent claims that the alleged legality of this transaction is irrelevant to the present dispute.161\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 2.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 33.\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 15.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the US$ 75 million came from the Escrow Account (see below). That money is also said to have been used to pay corrupt officials.162\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 34, relying on the PAC Report dated November 17, 2014 (Exh. C-367), allegedly showing payments to various officials, including Philip Saliboko, IPTL\u2019s Liquidator from July 2011 to December 2012, and Provisional Liquidator until September 2013 (pages 56-57). Also worth noting, the previous Provisional Liquidator Mr. Rugonzibwa is said to have been charged for receiving bribes from VIP in January 2015 (Cl. Tariff Rep., para. 39). The Respondent submits that the mere institution of criminal proceedings does not prove or disprove the innocence of these charged individuals (Resp. Tariff Rej., para. 47).\n\n167.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the sale of VIP\u2019s shares was done notwithstanding the fact that a receiver had been appointed by SCB HK over VIP\u2019s 30% shareholding in IPTL on December 15, 2008163 and notwithstanding SCB HK\u2019s rights as Security Agent under the Share Charge and the Shareholder Support Deed. The Claimant further contests the legality of this transaction because SCB HK has been in possession of the certificate for the IPTL shares since April 2011.164\n\nExh. R-120 (Letter from RHB Bank Berhad dated December 15, 2008).\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 33.\n\n168.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the purported legality of the IPTL\u2019s share transaction is irrelevant to the current dispute because it involved third parties to the present proceeding.165 On that basis, the Respondent contends that it cannot be called upon to answer for any issues arising from this transaction having not participated in it.166 In the alternative, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s alleged objection to the VIP-PAP SPA is premised on the fact that \"it had a valid charge of Mechmar\u2019s Shares\" in IPTL and that the foreign court orders \"were valid and effective in Tanzania,\" both of which are denied.167\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 15.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 15.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 15.\n\n169.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the VIP-PAP SPA, VIP agreed to withdraw its IPTL winding-up petition at the High Court of Tanzania, as described above, which resulted in the Order of September 5, 2013.168\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 2, 5(3), 39(1).\n\n**2. The transfer of IPTL\u2019s affairs to PAP**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Utamwa J Order ruled that (i) VIP\u2019s winding up petition was withdrawn, (ii) the Provisional Liquidator\u2019s appointment was terminated and the Provisional Liquidator was required to hand over all the affairs of IPTL to PAP, and (iii) took judicial notice of the SPA between VIP and PAP.169\n\nExh. C-312 (Ruling of Utamwa J dated September 5, 2013), page 4.\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimant considers this order to be \"a travesty of justice.\"170\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 41.\n\n**3. The registration of PAP as owner of the Mechmar shares**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe facts surrounding the events leading up to PAP\u2019s ownership of Mechmar\u2019s shares in IPTL are opaque.\n\n173.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, on September 6, 2013, PAP purported to hold a board meeting of IPTL at which it replaced the existing board of directors with its own nominees, and purported to transfer both VIP\u2019s 30% shareholding and the Mechmar shares to itself.171 The change of directors and transfer of shares were subsequently registered by the Business Registration and Licensing Authority of the United Republic of Tanzania.172\n\nExh. C-338 (IPTL Board Meeting Minutes dated September 6, 2013). Cl. Tariff Sub., paras. 46-47.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 46-47.\n\n174.\n\nIt remains unclear as to how and when Mechmar sold its shares to PAP.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, an investigation run by the newspaper \"The Citizen\" with the Tanzanian Revenue Authority shows that Mechmar sold its 70% share in IPTL to Piper Link for the small amount of US$ 3,750 in September 2013; while a few weeks later, PAP paid (i) VIP US$ 75 million for VIP\u2019s 30% shareholding and (ii) Piper Link US$ 300,000 for the Mechmar Shares.173\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 46-47. Exh C-335 (\"Fresh episode unveiled in IPTL purchase saga\", *The Citizen,* March 14, 2014).\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant also points out that, according to the recitals of the VIP-PAP SPA, PAP is said to have bought Mechmar\u2019s shares from Piper Link in October 2011 for US$ 20 million, a date on which the certificates to Mechmar shares had been delivered to IPTL\u2019s Receiver.174\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 33.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the above mentioned share transactions are premised on facts and opinions presented in local newspapers and are transactions to which it is not a party.175 The Respondent maintains that it is not in a position to comment on these facts or allegations because it is not a legal representative of PAP.176 The reality of the legal situation is that PAP was recognized as owner of the shares in IPTL in the Untamwa J Order.177 In any event, the Respondent reiterates that the orders of the Malaysian and BVI courts, including the alleged assignment of Mechmar\u2019s shares in IPTL to the Claimant, are invalid and have no legal effect in Tanzania (see below).178\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., paras. 18, 20.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 18.\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., para. 18.\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 19.\n\n**4. The Attorney General\u2019s letter dated October 3, 2013**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nOn October 2, 2013, the Attorney General of Tanzania issued a letter discussing the implementation of the Utamwa J Order.179 According to the Attorney General, a decision to release the funds from the Escrow Account (the \"Escrow Funds\") was \"safeguarded, protected and cushioned by the decision of the High Court (Utamwa J).\"180 In addition, the Attorney General noted that a decision to transfer the Escrow Account to IPTL will not be influenced by SCB HK because IPTL is a separate legal entity and this will provide a \"golden opportunity to disentangle\" the Government from \"unwarranted litigation.\"181\n\nExh. C-343 (Letter from MoEM to BoT dated October 21, 2013), Exh. C-344 (Memo from the Tanzanian Attorney General dated October 2, 2013).\n\nExh. C-344 (Memo from the Tanzanian Attorney General dated October 2, 2013).\n\nExh. C-344 (Memo from the Tanzanian Attorney General dated October 2, 2013).\n\n179.\n\nThe contents of the letter, especially in respect of the Escrow Account, are disputed by the Parties.\n\n180.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Utamwa J Order did not authorise the release of the Escrow Account, and the Attorney General exercised, to some extent, control over the decision to release the Escrow Funds.182\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para 53.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, denies that the Attorney General\u2019s letter would have authorized the release of the funds in the Escrow Account.183 However, the Respondent agrees that the Attorney General exercised control in some respect over the decision to release the funds in the Escrow Account by virtue of the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and as the custodian of the agreement in question,184 acting within his mandate.185 Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the funds in the Escrow Account were released because the conditions for release had been met and the Claimant\u2019s alleged interests in the shares were invalid in Tanzania given their lack of registration.186\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 21.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 22.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 22.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 23. Resp. Tariff Rej., paras. 86-98.\n\n182.\n\nLastly, the Respondent argues that SCB HK did not possess any legitimate entitlement to the funds in the Escrow Account on the ground that the account was governed by the Escrow Agreement between the GoT and IPTL, on the one hand, and the Bank of Tanzania, on the other.187 Numerous provisions of the Escrow Agreement barred any party other than the GoT and IPTL from having any interest in the account.188 In the same vein, the Respondent also contends that the Claimant had admitted by email to the Tribunal dated December 6, 2013, that it had no interest in the Escrow Account.189\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 24.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 24-25.\n\nExh. R-163 (Email from the Claimant\u2019s counsel to the Tribunal dated December 6, 2013).\n\n**5. The settlement of the tariff dispute between TANESCO and IPTL**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nOn October 3, 2013, TANESCO and IPTL entered into a settlement agreement (\"2013 Settlement Agreement\") covering their tariff dispute whereby two options were agreed upon.190 Pursuant to the first option, where interest payments on capacity charges would be waived, the parties agreed that the outstanding balance was US$ 167,885,719.97. Pursuant to the second option, where interest payments would not be waived, the outstanding balance was US$ 201,449,724.50.\n\nExh. C-314 (Minutes of October 3, 2013 meeting between TANESCO and IPTL).\n\n184.\n\nA joint recommendation by TANESCO and IPTL was that \"monies in the Escrow Account were to be released to IPTL as soon as possible.\"191\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 59.\n\n185.\n\nThe Parties have different views on the reasons leading to the 2013 Settlement Agreement between the respective parties as well as the substance of the agreement.\n\n186.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, TANESCO agreed to pay the outstanding capacity charges (US$ 165.4 million) in full and a top up of US$ 110 million, already deposited in the Escrow Account, as calculated pursuant to the Implementation Model agreed between TANESCO and IPTL in 2002 pursuant to ICSID award 1. TANESCO and IPTL agreed that, absent a waiver of interest and a discretionary discount, the total amount outstanding including bonus payments and interest was US$ 201 million.192 For the Claimant, as a consequence, IPTL was in a stronger financial position and the risk of the appointment of a liquidator was largely reduced.193\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 8(1).\n\nCl. PHB2, para. 5.\n\n187.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, a letter of August 19, 2014, from TANESCO to the Controller and Auditor General (\"CAG\")194 shows that TANESCO\u2019s case in this arbitration is inconsistent and groundless and that there was no dispute regarding capacity charges, and that TANESCO believed those amounts to be due and payable to IPTL.\n\nLetter produced by the Respondent on October 28, 2015 and filed by the Claimant with its PHB2 as Exh. C-417 (Letter from TANESCO dated August 19, 2014).\n\n188.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, TANESCO\u2019s position during the August Hearing that it paid invoices to PAP-controlled IPTL (produced on August 3, 2015) between 2013 and 2015 \"under protest\" is unsupported.195 On the contrary, the invoices produced show that capacity and energy charges have been paid in full since October 2013.196\n\nCl. PHB2, para. 9.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 42.\n\n189.\n\nFor the Claimant, the 2013 Settlement Agreement clearly related to the tariff dispute,197 a point disputed by the Respondent.\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., paras. 169-176.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that TANESCO\u2019s actions have been inconsistent: it asserted claims against IPTL before the Provisional Liquidator in April 2012.198 Notwithstanding that claim, it agreed that it owed over US$ 200 million to IPTL in 2013.199 The Claimant also argues that the Respondent\u2019s new quantum expert relies on the same erroneous assertions as its previous expert David Ehrhardt of Castalia LLC to allege that a payment is due from IPTL to TANESCO.200\n\nExh.

Tariff Rep., para. 26.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 29.\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimant believes that TANESCO was right to concede that it owed IPTL US$ 201 million but wrong in the way it was disbursed.201 The Claimant also considers that TANESCO\u2019s admission in the 2013 Settlement Agreement contradicts its position on the tariff calculation in this arbitration.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 29.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimant considers that it never misrepresented its knowledge of events in Tanzania to the Tribunal. In particular, the Claimant submits that it was aware of the Utamwa J Order and the rumours about TANESCO having entered into an agreement to settle the outstanding tariff payments, but it was unaware of the terms of that agreement and what was payable by TANESCO to IPTL.202\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 71, 74.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant is wrong in suggesting that the 2013 Settlement Agreement concerned tariffs.203 Instead, the Respondent submits that the meeting between TANESCO and IPTL leading up to the settlement addressed outstanding payments due to IPTL but not the tariff dispute,204 leading to no inconsistency.205 In the view of the Respondent, this is evidenced by the fact that the agenda of the minutes of meeting did not include anything on the tariff dispute,206 a point disputed by the Claimant.\n\nResp.

C-314 (Minutes of October 3, 2013 meeting between TANESCO and IPTL).\n\n194.\n\nFor the Respondent, the 2013 Settlement Agreement represented a compromise in which TANESCO was requested to stop resisting the payment of tariff invoices and the withdrawal of monies from the Escrow Account.207 In particular, the Respondent claims that the agreement was not reached because TANESCO accepted that the disputed invoices and/or the applicable tariff were correct.208 Instead, in return for a commitment by PAP, the Respondent maintains that reciprocal incentives were provided by IPTL, including by converting the Tegeta generators from a heavy oils to a gas firing plant and a massive reduction in the rate of energy charges within the shortest time frame.209\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., para. 30.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 30.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 30. Exh. R-170 (Ruling order of the High Court (Utamwa J) dated December 6, 2013.\n\n195.\n\nIn specific terms, the Respondent claims that the settlement addressed the following issues:\n\nIn relation to capacity charges, the issue that prompted the meeting was, as can be gathered from the letter from the Chairman of the Board of Directors of TANESCO to the permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Minerals dated 9 October 2013, was [sic] whether, in light of the Utamwa J Order and the advice of the Attorney General, IPTL was entitled to be paid the moneys in the Escrow Account at the time of the Order, or whether it was also entitled to the amount that was not deposited after TANESCO had stopped payments in 2010. Previously, TANESCO had advised the Ministry that IPTL was entitled only to the money in the Escrow Account. Following the negotiations, TANESCO agreed that IPTL was entitled also to the amount that was not deposited. It is in this context that the letter of the Chairman concludes by saying that \"TANESCO vacates from its previous position to the effect that IPTL is not entitled to any sum than what was deposited into escrow account.\" Thus, the issue that had been settled was, whether as a result of the Utamwa J Order and the advice of the Attorney General, IPTL was entitled to receivables in the Escrow Account at the time of the Order or whether it was also entitled, by reason of the Court Order, to the amount that was not deposited as from 2010.\n\nThe other related issues that were discussed between TANESCO and IPTL were (i) whether the payments made to IPTL during the Interim Power Purchase Agreement (IPPA) should be deducted, whether capacity charges were payable for the period when IPTL was under liquidation, the need for indemnity in light of the ongoing proceedings before ICSID, interests and penalties on outstanding capacity charges and whether VAT was chargeable on capacity charges. The issue of tariff was not discussed at all. Indeed, the word \"tariff\u2019 does not appear anywhere in the Minutes.210\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., paras, 33-34. Footnote omitted.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects assertions regarding its purported attempt to disown its proof of debt and its expert David Ehrhardt of Castalia LLC.211 According to the Respondent, at one point TANESCO and the GoT were concerned by the endless litigation involving IPTL and were worried that some persons within or acting on behalf of TANESCO in the litigation were pursuing interests at the expense of the institution212 In any event, the Respondent submits that these issues are irrelevant for current purposes.213\n\nResp.

TANESCO has no choice but to do so, otherwise the production would be shut off.216\n\nLetter produced by the Respondent on October 28, 2015 and filed by the Claimant with its PHB2 as Exh.

TANESCO allegedly misled the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent misled the Tribunal by concealing the above facts from the Tribunal and from SCB HK. According to the Claimant, the Respondent conspired with other Tanzanian parties to have the funds in the Escrow Account (which was established to hold disputed payments) released, and paid to a third party to enable that third party to purchase shares in IPTL in breach of SCB HK\u2019s security over those shares.228\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 4 and 66.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant submits that TANESCO\u2019s letter dated December 13, 2013 contained a \"fraudulent misrepresentation\" of TANESCO\u2019s position and of the current state of affairs.\n\n209.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in this letter, TANESCO:\n\n(1) Took the position that the Utamwa J Order did not materially alter SCB HK\u2019s circumstances and that there was no need for urgent action by this Tribunal;\n\n(2) Reiterated its position that \"SCB HK\u2019s argument starts from the false premise that the PPA requires Tanesco to pay the tariff as calculated by IPTL, whereas Tanesco contends IPTL has miscalculated the equity portion of the tariff\u2019;\n\n(3) Continued to argue that \"TANESCO alleges the tariff charged by IPTL under the PPA is excessive. There is no reason why TANESCO would agree to pay, under the relevant provisions of the PPA, the excessive tariff charged by IPTL. That is why TANESCO issued invoice dispute notices, discontinued payments to IPTL, and paid money into the escrow account, commencing in 2007 (emphasis added).\" Such statements imply that the tariff dispute was still on-going at the date of writing;\n\n(4) Stated that \"Tanesco is not a party to the Escrow Agreement between GoT, IPTL and the Bank of Tanzania; Tanesco has no control over that account.\" Whilst strictly speaking this was true, the reality was that Tanesco had already requested and approved the release of the funds in the Escrow Account; and\n\n(5) Alleged that \"there has been no material change in SCB HK\u2019s \u2018position on the ground\u2019 in Tanzania as a result of Tanzanian court rulings. SCB HK is not justified in asserting there is an \u2018urgent\u2019 need for this Tribunal to issue its award to avoid a further \u2018deterioration\u2019 of its position.\" It is difficult to conceive how the complete release of the Escrow Account to IPTL (PAP) would not amount to a material change in SCB HK\u2019s position on the ground in Tanzania.229\n\nCl.

Tariff Sub., para. 74. *See also* para. 85(1).\n\n213.\n\nOn April 23, 2014, the High Court of Tanzania issued interim orders on the basis of the *ex parte* application made by IPTL and PAP in order to maintain the *status quo238* In essence, the order prevented the parties from \"doing anything towards enforcing, complying with or operationalizing [the Tribunal\u2019s Decision].\"239\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 74. Exh. C-351 *(Ex parte* Injunction Order in Civil Case No. 60 dated April 23, 2014).\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 74.\n\n214.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, hearings on the interim orders that were scheduled on May 21, 2014, and on June 2, 2014, respectively, were adjourned.240\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 76-78.\n\n215.\n\nOn September 30, 2014, Judge Twaib ruled on the continuance of the interim orders by holding that SCB HK, the Administrative Receiver and TANESCO were precluded from executing the Tribunal\u2019s Decision pending the final determination of the applicant\u2019s suit.241 The Claimant has indicated that the injunction is still in force and not subject to any right of appeal or revision.242\n\nExh. C-352 (Injunction Order in Civil Case No. 60 dated September 30, 2014), page 16, para. 5.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 82.\n\n216.\n\nFor the Claimant, IPTL\u2019s and PAP\u2019s claims are without merit. First, they appear to claim that the assignment of the loan and security package from the original consortium of Malaysian banks to SCB HK was void based on Section 172 of the Tanzania Companies Ordinance, because it was concluded whilst a winding-up petition remained outstanding in respect of IPTL. This is said to be incorrect as Section 172 applies only to the disposition of a company's property, not its debts: \"IPTL\u2019s debts, such as that owed to the lenders under the Facility Agreement, are not property of IPTL and cannot therefore be subject to Section 172 \"243\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 81.\n\n217.\n\nSecond, IPTL and PAP claim that SCB HK has inflated the amount it is claiming under the Facility Agreement, which cannot exceed US$ 26 million since SCB HK is not entitled to charge interest on the debt or to recover other costs and charges. According to IPTL and PAP, the amount drawn down under the Facility Agreement was US$ 84 million, of which US$ 58 million has already been repaid. According to SCB HK, this is without merit and at odds with the terms of the Facility Agreement.244\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 81.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimant contends that \"[w]hilst Tanesco was a respondent to that application, it supported the application for the injunction and submitted that IPTL and PAP should be given more time to prove the allegations of fraud despite the fact that these arbitration proceedings are on-going. TANESCO\u2019s actions show its contempt for this arbitration, and this Tribunal.\"245\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 12.\n\n219.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, considers that it has no reason to comment on the issuance of the interim orders because it is not an applicant in these proceedings.246\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 47.\n\n**2. Investigations relating to the Escrow Account in Tanzania**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the dissipation of the funds from the Escrow Account has caused a scandal and attracted significant attention in Tanzania as a result of which various investigations have been initiated.247 The Public Accounts Committee (\"PAC\") requested a thorough investigation and audit of the accounts by the CAG.248 A parallel criminal investigation has been ordered to be conducted by the Prevention and Combatting of Corruption Bureau.249\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 83-84.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 83.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 83.\n\n221.\n\nA report was submitted by the Tanzanian Auditor General to the Speaker\u2019s Office of the Tanzanian Parliament on November 14, 2014 (\"CAG Report\")250 and a report was issued by the Public Accounts Committee on November 17, 2014 (\"PAC Report\").251\n\nExh.

Tariff Rep., paras. 6, 34.\n\n222.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, these reports reveal corruption and inappropriate conduct at all levels in the GoT with respect to IPTL and the Project.252 It submits that the reports show that PAP\u2019s claims to ownership of the Mechmar shares were false.\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 7.\n\n223.\n\nThe Parliament passed Resolutions following the PAC Report on November 29, 2014. The Claimant submits that PAP and IPTL tried to prevent the Parliamentary Resolutions from being implemented. On December 16, 2014, the Attorney General resigned; on December 22, 2014, the President \"sacked the Land and Housing Minister, who had received US$ 1 million from VIP\"; on December 24, 2014, the President suspended the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Minerals; on January 24, 2015, the Minister of Energy and Minerals resigned.253\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 38.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the relevance of the above events to the present proceeding254 and characterised it as \"baseless propaganda.\"255 It denies any relation between the facts alleged here and the resignations or sackings mentioned by the Claimant.256 For the Respondent, the Parliament expressly rejected several of the PAC\u2019s findings and did not adopt the proposed resolutions but formed a Recommendations Committee, which proposed a different set of resolutions which called for more investigation. Accordingly, the PAC\u2019s \"revelations\" have no evidentiary value, nor legal standing,257 and have to been read with caution as they reflect the \"abyss of Tanzanian politics.\"258 In particular, the Respondent argues that the matters cited in the above investigations and reports do not constitute proof of a corruption case.259 According to Respondent, even if proven, the allegations would not support the conclusion that the Claimant\u2019s rights were not respected in Tanzania.260\n\nFor an overview of the Respondent\u2019s position on this issue, *see* Resp.

The failure of the negotiations on the tariff recalculation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, TANESCO has failed to engage or even respond substantively to SCB HK\u2019s attempts to initiate a process to negotiate recalculation of the tariff as directed by the Tribunal in its Decision.261\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 72.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent denies criticisms about not having engaged in the recalculation exercise. Specifically, the Respondent contends that it informed the Tribunal and the Claimant about its procurement process for obtaining new legal representation and about a restraining order issued by a local judge at the behest of IPTL and PAP, which prevented TANESCO from engaging in the tariff recalculation exercise within the prescribed time period.262 In particular, the Respondent points out that its request for extension of time was neither answered by the Claimant nor addressed by the Tribunal.263\n\nResp.

The Claimant\u2019s request for reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and other relief264**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Tribunal has not set out below the arguments of the Parties which were a re-pleading of issues dealt with in its Decision and which played no part in the Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s position**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) The situation as it stands today**\n---------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s concern in its Decision was that an administrator or liquidator could be appointed, and could have claimed from TANESCO the outstanding sums under the PPA for the benefits of IPTL\u2019s unsecured creditors. An order from this Tribunal requiring TANESCO to pay SCB HK would have potentially interfered with the administrator or liquidator\u2019s rights.265\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 112(5).\n\n228.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent\u2019s former counsel, Hunton & Williams, explained in its letter dated December 13, 2013, that TANESCO did not have control over the funds held in the Escrow Account.266 TANESCO failed to inform the Tribunal that in October 2013 it had already participated in a financial arrangement whereby the Escrow Funds were to be released to PAP, and whereby VIP was to be paid US$ 75 million267 VIP, the minority shareholder, should have received payment only if IPTL had been solvent and if other creditors had been paid.268\n\nExh.

Tariff Sub., para. 113.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 113.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant points out the legal and practical difficulties with the current situation.\n\n230.\n\nIn so far as there is no liquidator or administrator, the non-registration of the assignment in Tanzania is irrelevant.269 Until a liquidator or administrator is appointed, the assignment is fully valid and effective, and any rights under the PPA belong to SCB HK and not to IPTL.270 The Claimant describes this as a \"black hole\" as TANESCO can ignore its payment obligations under the PPA and SCB HK would be unable to enforce them.271 That \"black hole\" could only be resolved if a liquidator or administrator were to be appointed over IPTL, which is \"in the gift of the Tanzania Courts.\"272 Even if a liquidator or administrator were to be appointed there is no assurance that s/he would enforce TANESCO\u2019s obligations under the PPA.273\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 112(4)(a).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 114.\n\nCl.

They knowingly permitted payment to a party other than the statutory assignee.276 SCB HK alone had the authority to give TANESCO a good discharge of its debt.277 SCB HK requests a declaration that TANESCO has not been discharged of its indebtedness under the PPA.278 This declaration is within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and is independent of whether the Tribunal reconsiders its Decision or not.279\n\nCl.

Tariff Rep., paras. 148-150.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 142.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant further requests the Tribunal to reconsider its Decision not to order payment under the PPA to SCB HK because that decision was (i) affected by TANESCO\u2019s misrepresentation about the likelihood of having a liquidator or administrator appointed in the future280 and (ii) an error of law.281\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 126-127.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 128.\n\n234.\n\nAs already explained, the Claimant considers that counsel for the Respondent misled the Tribunal in its Letter of December 13, 2013. By releasing the Escrow Funds to IPTL, TANESCO dramatically reduced the prospect of a liquidator or administrator being appointed.282\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 286.\n\n235.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant alleges that the Tribunal erroneously concluded that it lacked the power to order payment to SCB HK whereas, under Tanzanian law, it would have the power since no liquidator or administrator had been appointed to IPTL.283\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 290.\n\n236.\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s expert, Lord Hoffmann, the Tribunal has the power, under Tanzanian law, to order payment to SCB HK in circumstances where no liquidator or administrator has been appointed by IPTL.284 The Claimant argues that the possibility of a liquidator or administrator being appointed in the future does not deprive the Tribunal of the power to order TANESCO to pay outstanding sums under the PPA to SCB HK.285\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 290.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 291.\n\n237.\n\nAccording to Lord Hoffmann, the award would not have interfered with the question of priority among creditors.286\n\nOpinion of Lord Hoffmann, para. 12.\n\n238.\n\nIn so far as the Tribunal was misled or made its Decision on the basis of an error of law, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal is entitled to reconsider its Decision.287\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 129.\n\n239.\n\nIn support of its request for reconsideration, the Claimant submits that an ICSID tribunal has the power to reconsider a decision as opposed to an award.288 This interpretation is endorsed by the dissenting opinion of Professor Georges Abi-Saab in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,289*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 130.\n\nExh. CLA-92 *(ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v.

For the majority\u2019s decision, *see* Exh. CLA-91 *(ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014).\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimant submits that:\n\n241.\n\nFirst, a decision does not become final unless and until it is incorporated into an award, which settles every issue that has been submitted to the Tribunal in accordance with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention.290 Until that point, a decision would not fall within the scope of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, which stipulates that an award is binding upon the Parties.291 The ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules contain no provision that precludes a Tribunal from revisiting its own decisions.292\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 131(1). Exh. CLA-92 *(ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014, Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Georges Abi-Saab), paras. 33-50.\n\nCl.

Tariff Rep., para. 278.\n\n242.\n\nSecond, a decision as opposed to an award does not fall within the purview of post-award remedies under Articles 50-52 of the ICSID Convention.293 This distinction supports the understanding that a decision is not considered final and remains open to reconsideration by the Tribunal.294\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 131(2).\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 131(2). Exh. CLA-92 *(ConocoPhillips v.

Tariff Sub., para. 131(3)-(7).\n\n244.\n\nFourth, the reconsideration of a decision in exceptional circumstances guarantees the possibility of remedying any inefficiency or uncertainty that may arise.296 A decision procured by fraud enters into such a category.297 The Claimant submits that the decision that the Tribunal lacked the power to order payment in this case was indeed procured by fraud. IPTL was in a strong financial situation contrary to TANESCO\u2019s assertions, and would have been able to pay its creditors reducing the prospect of a liquidator or administrator being appointed.298\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 131(8).\n\nCl. PHB2, paras. 68-69.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 72-76.\n\n245.\n\nIn light of the above, the Claimant submits that the present case warrants the reconsideration of the Decision, given TANESCO\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations and the error of law.\n\n246.\n\nIn the alternative to its reconsideration case, the Claimant argues that by analogy with Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal can revise its Decision on the basis of a new fact of such a nature that would have decisively affected its Decision - such fact being in this case \"the materially reduced likelihood of a liquidator being appointed.\"299\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 65, 70-71.\n\n**c) The Claimant seeks an order for the full amount due under the PPA**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal accepts to reconsider its previous Decision and order payment to SCB HK, the Claimant has now changed its approach from seeking payment of only the amount it calculates as necessary to discharge its loan to IPTL to seeking the full amount due from TANESCO to IPTL, even though in excess of the amount due to IPTL to SCB HK under the Facility Agreement.300\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 137.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant submits that:\n\nTo avoid any future confusion, SCB HK requests that the Tribunal confirms that this is not intended as a determination that SCB HK\u2019s enforcement costs are not recoverable from IPTL under the Facility Agreement (a question over which the Tribunal had already confirmed it had no jurisdiction) but only a finding that SCB HK could not seek to recover these sums as a separate claim from Tanesco under the PPA, distinct from its claim for the tariff due under the PPA.\n\nSCB HK now requests that the Tribunal order Tanesco to pay SCB HK the full amount outstanding under the PPA. SCB HK will then account to IPTL for any balance in excess of the amount outstanding under the senior debt to IPTL. Pursuant to the dispute resolution clauses in the Facility Agreement and related security documents, SCB HK has commenced proceedings in the English High Court against IPTL for relief including a declaration as to the amount outstanding under the Facility Agreement.301\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 142.\n\n249.\n\nIn its second Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant requests that the tariff dispute be settled according to the October 2013 Settlement Agreement. Although SCB HK does not agree to the adjustments conceded by IPTL in that agreement, it is prepared to adopt that agreement nonetheless.302\n\nCl. PHB2, paras. 83-84.\n\n250.\n\nSCB HK therefore requests \"that the Tribunal determine that the outstanding sum under the PPA is US$ 201.4 million from the October 2013 Agreement plus interest at the contractual rate in the PPA from October 2013 until the date of payment. As at September 2015, the sum outstanding on this basis was US$ 214.6 million.\"303\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 86.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**a) TANESCO did not commit any fraud on the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nAs already indicated above, the Respondent denies any misleading of the Tribunal and maintains that there was no fraudulent non-disclosure because there had been no new developments or a change in the *status quo.* In addition, the Claimant\u2019s situation had not deteriorated.304 Both the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the release of the Escrow Funds were known to the Claimant and to the Tribunal at the time of the Decision.\n\nResp. PHB2, paras. 7-8.\n\n**b) On the question of reconsideration or revision**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision being reopened because it is final regarding the issues decided therein and thus *res judicata305* Even if it were possible, the Respondent argues that the reasons asserted by the Claimant would not trigger a reconsideration of the Decision.306 Lastly, should the Tribunal decide to reconsider its Decision, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to reopen the Decision to have the ability to challenge conclusions that are adverse to the Respondent\u2019s position.307\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 81.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 81.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 82.\n\n253.\n\nNotwithstanding that the Decision is called a preliminary decision on jurisdiction, the Respondent contends that it is by nature final because it terminates the interim proceedings on jurisdiction.308 The final character of a preliminary decision is confirmed by Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention requiring its incorporation into the final award.309\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 93.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 94.\n\n254.\n\nThe final character of the Decision was recognized when the Tribunal declined its jurisdiction over part of the dispute. If a Tribunal decides that it lacks jurisdiction, then the Decision will be final and under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(6) it must be issued as an award.\n\n255.\n\nThe Respondent argues that to the extent that the Decision denies jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s request for an order to pay, then it would represent an award that is *res judicata310* In terms of substance, the Decision is an award within the meaning of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention and only subject to the remedies under Articles 49-52 of the ICSID Convention.311 The Decision follows also the form and content foreseen by an award under Article 48 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47.312\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 96.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 96.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 98.\n\n256.\n\nSince the Tribunal\u2019s Decision is *res judicata,* the Respondent argues that the Tribunal is prevented from reconsidering its jurisdiction in the course of the arbitral proceedings.313 The Respondent relies on the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* and *Perenco v. Ecuador* decisions to support its position on the following nine grounds.314\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 99.\n\nExh. CLA-91 *(ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014). Exh. RLA-84 *(Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Ecuador\u2019s Reconsideration Motion dated April 10, 2015).\n\n257.\n\nFirst, regardless of their labelling as \"interim\" or \"preliminary\", decisions are final with respect to the matter decided therein and thus are not intended to be reconsidered.315\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 101. Exh. CLA-91 (*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014), para. 20.\n\n258.\n\nSecond, the structure and provisions of the ICSID Convention were created with the intent that a review of a decision would only take place after an award is rendered.316 Section 5 of Part IV of the ICSID Convention provides the only means to seek redress about a decision.317 The power of reconsideration of a decision is excluded by Section 5 and the structure of the ICSID Convention.318\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 102.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 102.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 102.\n\n259.\n\nThree, the majority decision in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* should be followed because it is consistent with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.319\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 103.\n\n260.\n\nFour, there is no reason why the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab should be followed because his views have never been adopted by an ICSID tribunal and accepting his approach would interfere with established ICSID principles and practice.320\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 103.\n\n261.\n\nFive, the Respondent argues that ICSID tribunals do not possess a \"general\" power to reconsider their decisions.321\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 107.\n\n262.\n\nSix, granting the right of reconsideration would create an imbalance in the ICSID procedure. According to the Respondent:\n\n[...] Granting a right of \"reconsideration\" with respect to matters that have been decided by way of a Decision rather than in the Award would create an imbalance in the system in that such matters on which the proceedings have been bifurcated (e.g. jurisdiction, liability) would be subject to the possibility of a repeated review by the Tribunal -thereby defeating the very purpose of bifurcation - whereas in the absence of a bifurcation the Tribunal could only decide once thereon, namely in the Award. Furthermore, depending on whether a particular matter was decided in a Decision or in an Award, the disgruntled party would either benefit from a broader and potentially endless possibility of review or be restricted to the limited remedies provided for in Articles 49 to 52 of the ICSID Convention. [...]322\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 109.\n\n263.\n\nSeven, it would be procedurally inefficient to permit issues to be continuously re-litigated and reviewed until the party dissatisfied with the outcome finally obtains a satisfactory remedy.323 Even if a tribunal were to assume jurisdiction on an erroneous basis and accumulate wasted costs with the merits phase of the arbitration, it would be irrelevant if as here the Tribunal had assumed jurisdiction over some of the Claimant\u2019s claims.324\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 110.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 110.\n\n264.\n\nEight, there is no \"specific\" power of reconsideration that would be available to an ICSID tribunal in case it becomes aware of an error of law or fact, or in case new evidence changed circumstances.325 No precedent exists for such a power of reconsideration.326\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., paras. 112-113.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 113.\n\n265.\n\nNinth and lastly, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision is not based on an error of law.327 Also, the Respondent reiterates that it has not made any misrepresentations or fraudulently misled the Tribunal about the appointment of a liquidator or administrator to IPTL.328\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 115.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 42-45, 116-117.\n\n266.\n\nBased on the above, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision is final because it is *res judicata* and thus not subject to reconsideration by the Tribunal.\n\n267.\n\nRegarding the issue of whether by analogy with Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, a new fact would justify reconsideration (a point raised by Professor Stern at the August Hearing), the Respondent denies that such Article could apply to preliminary decisions, and submits that the requirements of such an Article are not met. The new fact, which must be established by the Claimant, is simply missing. The Tribunal made no determinations about the likelihood of a liquidator or administrator being appointed in its Decision. The 2013 Settlement Agreement and the release of the Escrow Account have no bearing on this issue. Both facts were known to the Claimant and the Tribunal. The Claimant mentioned them in a letter to the Tribunal of November 27, 2013. The Tribunal referred to this letter in its Decision at paragraph 85. If anything, the Claimant\u2019s ignorance was due to its own negligence and its failure to make any request for disclosure.329\n\nResp. PHB2, paras. 31-59.\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the idea that a tribunal could informally revise a decision, as it is *res judicata330*\n\n*Ibid.,* page 19.\n\n269.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent introduced a request for a preliminary ruling on the issue of reconsideration.331 As decided in Procedural Order No. 13, this issue was reserved for the August Hearing.332\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., paras. 133-134.\n\nFor the Tribunal\u2019s discussion on the reconsideration issue, *see* paras. 307-360 below.\n\n**c) On the Claimant\u2019s requests for further declaratory relief**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent asks for the dismissal of all the Claimant\u2019s requests for further declaratory relief.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s request for further declaratory relief regarding the non-discharge of TANESCO\u2019s indebtedness under the PPA on the same grounds as the reconsideration.333 Payments into the Escrow Account in November 2006 and December 2012 validly discharged TANESCO\u2019s obligation under the PPA.334 The Claimant itself stated in an email of December 6, 2013, that the monies in the Escrow Account were irrelevant to the issues to be discussed by the Tribunal.335\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., paras. 122-123. *See* Resp. Tariff Rej., para. 136.\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., paras. 138-141, 153.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 143.\n\n272.\n\nIt further objects to the request for the full amount under the PPA, an inadmissible request which the Tribunal has already rejected in its Decision.336\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 124. Resp. Tariff Rej., paras. 145-148.\n\n**C. The Parties\u2019 positions on the recalculation of the tariff/amount to be paid**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s position**\n------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nAlthough not agreeing with every element of the calculation used,337 the Claimant argues that the tariff recalculation is unnecessary because it is willing to adopt the amounts recorded in the 2013 Settlement Agreement in the interest of an expedited resolution of the dispute.338\n\nIn particular, the Claimant disagrees with IPTL\u2019s waiver of 70% of the bonus payment due.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 92.\n\n274.\n\nThus, the Claimant considers that under this approach, the outstanding sum from TANESCO is US$ 201.4 million plus interest at the contractual rate of LIBOR + 4% since October 2013, i.e. a total of US$ 214.6 million as of September 20 1 5.339 The Claimant\u2019s position is conditional upon the Tribunal\u2019s confirmation that payments made by TANESCO to IPTL under the 2013 Settlement Agreement would not discharge the outstanding sums from TANESCO under the PPA.340 SCB HK requests that the Tribunal declare that the sum due from TANESCO is in US$, and not in TSH, with interest from October 2013 to the date of payment.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 91-92. Second Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated November 10, 2014, para. 3.13, 9.2. Third Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated March 26, 2015, para. 2.24. Updated in Cl. PHB2, para. 86.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 94, 122-124.\n\n275.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal determine the full amount actually owed under the PPA.341 In that case, the Claimant argues that the settlement sum agreed by TANESCO, the GoT and IPTL should be the lowest figure to be considered by the Tribunal.342\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 94.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 95.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s expert submits six possible scenarios, which are set out in the table below:343\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Options for resolution of outstanding tariff |\n| IRR and assumed form of equity investment | 17.19% (shareholder loan) | 21.25% (shareholder loan) | 22.31% (shareholder loan) | October 2013 Agreement with interest to February 2015 | 26.08% (shareholder loan) | 22.31% (share capital) | 30.71% (shareholder loan) |\n| Implications | Would permit the project to remain cash positive and pay sums due under the loan. Would not comply with the banking covenants in the Facility Agreement, either as modelled in the Implementation Model or at all. | Would permit project to comply with Senior Debt Cover Ratio, but not other covenants such as Debt Service Reserve Account or Maintenance Reserve Fund | Retains the IRR agreed between IPTL and Tanesco as per Mr Rugamalira's letter of 31 May 1995, as adopted by the ICSID 1 Tribunal as the assumptions on which the tariff was based, but recalculates the tariff to achieve that ERR on the assumption the equity is invested by way of a shareholder loan rather than paid in share capital, resulting in a reduction in tariff Would permit project to comply with Senior Debt Cover Ratio, but not other covenants such as Debt Service Reserve Account or Maintenance Reser.-e Fund | Agreed by all of PAP-controlled IPTL, Tanesco, GoT, and (now) SCB HK. Includes a number of concessions, including a 70% discount on outstanding bonus payments. SCB HK. is prepared to accept these concessions as part of this option in interests of global agreement, without prejudice to its right to argue for the full amounts due under any other scenario. | Equivalent banking covenant compliance to that modelled by IPTL and Tanesco in the Implementation Model in 2003. | No change to the tariff | Full compliance with Facility Agreement requirements for Senior **Debt** Cover Ratio.

The outstanding tariff under a shareholder equity model would be US$ 186.1 million as of September 20 1 5.345\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 105. Updated in Cl. PHB2.\n\n278.\n\nThe minimum IRR calculated on a shareholder loan should be in any event no lower than 17.19% in order to be sufficient to enable the project to fulfil its payment obligations and to remain solvent.346 This would result in an outstanding tariff of US$ 103.8 million as of September 20 1 5.347 The Claimant disputes the IRR of 13.08% used by the Respondent.348\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 102-103.\n\nThird Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated March 26, 2015, para. 2.25. Updated in Cl. PHB2.\n\nCl. PHB2, paras. 105-145.\n\n279.\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s expert, a shareholder loan with an IRR below 17.19% leaves the company with insufficient cash to meet all of its cash requirements without additional shareholder funds and hence an IRR of at least 21.25% is required for it to meet the Debt Service Cover Ratio (\"DSCR\") requirement and 26.08% and 30.71% IRR for a shareholder loan are required respectively to achieve full compliance with the Debt Service Reserve Account (\"DSRA\") and the Maintenance Reserve Account (\"MRA\") obligations as well as the DSCR obligation.349\n\nSecond Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated November 10, 2014, para. 5.38.\n\n280.\n\nOn the assumption that the shareholders\u2019 equity is invested by way of shareholder loans rather than paid up share capital, the IRR should not be lower than 22.31%.350 Otherwise it would generate a reduction greater than the one agreed between the GoT, TANESCO and IPTL (US$ 81.6 million).351 The Claimant maintains that 22.31% remains a reasonable return based upon the risk of investing in a power plant in Tanzania. It was also what was agreed by the Parties in 1995, making the one modification that the Tribunal requested to reflect a shareholder loan rather than equity.352 This results in significant savings to TANESCO, and even results in a lower tariff than TANESCO agreed with PAP-controlled IPTL in October 2013. Under a shareholder loan option, the outstanding tariff would be US$ 148.4 million as of September 20 1 5.353 This is the alternative position of SCB HK.354\n\nCl.

The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nIn so far as the Claimant is not the legal owner of the PPA and the alleged assignment of the PPA was invalid under Tanzanian law,360 the Respondent does not have any legal obligations towards the Claimant under the PPA and it does not owe any money to the Claimant.361\n\nResp.

Reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The claims relating to reopening**\n---------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimant challenges the conclusion of the Tribunal in its Decision that while it could make a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK under the PPA, it could not make an order for payment of that amount.396\n\nDecision, paras. 182, 183 and 379.\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal has the power to reconsider its Decision, invoking the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela.397* In the Claimant\u2019s view, a decision does not become final and *res judicata* until it is incorporated into the final award; there is no prohibition on reopening a decision in the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules; and there are pragmatic reasons for recognizing a power to reopen.398\n\nExh. CLA-91 *(ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014).\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., paras. 130-133.\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there is no power under the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules to reopen a decision of an ICSID tribunal which is final and *res judicata.399* The Respondent rejects the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab and relies instead on the majority decision in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela,* which concluded that a decision was *res judicata* and could not be reopened,400 and the award of the tribunal in *Perenco v. Ecuador,*401 where a similar conclusion was reached.402 The Respondent argues that there is no general power in a tribunal to reopen decisions, nor a specific power in the event of error of law or the discovery of some new evidence.\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 99\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 100-105.\n\nExh. RLA-84 *(Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Ecuador\u2019s Reconsideration Motion dated April 10, 2015).\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., para. 104.\n\n306.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues, even if there were a power to reopen, the facts in this case do not support reopening. There was no error of law or any failure to disclose any material fact or misrepresentation by the Respondent in its December 13, 2013 Letter, and hence no fraudulent misrepresentation.403\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., paras 42-45.\n\n**2. Does the Tribunal have the power to reconsider its Decision?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by observing that there is nothing in either the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules dealing explicitly with the question of reconsideration of a decision. The power to reconsider an award is dealt with in Articles 51 and 52. The former relates to the revision of an award in the light of \"the discovery of some fact of such a nature as to decisively affect the award\" and the latter to an application for the annulment of an award. There are no equivalent provisions relating to decisions.\n\n308.\n\nThere is little arbitral jurisprudence on this question. The two cases directly on point and referred to by the parties are *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela404* and *Perenco v. Ecuador,405* both of which concluded that there is no power to reopen a decision of an ICSID tribunal. Since the conclusion of the written and oral arguments in this case, the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal has issued a ruling on a further request for reopening.406 The majority reiterated its earlier decision. The third arbitrator, Professor Andreas Bucher, who had replaced Professor Abi-Saab, dissented from the majority taking essentially the same view as Professor Abi-Saab that there is a power to reopen, and incorporating Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s dissent into his own.407 No case has directly concluded that there is such a power although there are cases that appear to acknowledge the possibility of, or the existence of, such a power without applying it to reopen a decision.408\n\nExh. CLA-91 *(ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014).\n\nExh. RLA-84 *(Perenco Ecuador Limited v.

Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of March 10, 2014 dated February 9, 2016.\n\n*Ibid,* Dissenting opinion of Prof. Andreas Bucher, para. 34.\n\nExh. CLA-95 *(Antoine Biloune (Syria) and Marine Drive Complex Ltd. (Ghana) v. Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana* (UNCITRAL), Award on Jurisdiction and Liability dated October 27, 1989 (the *\"Biloune* award\")); *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals SA. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2), Award dated September 16, 2015.\n\n309.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal is the relationship under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules between a decision of a tribunal and an award of a tribunal and whether a decision partakes of at least one characteristic of an award - that it is *res judicata.* Clearly a decision is not an award. In accordance with Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, since it deals with a question submitted to the Tribunal, a decision must be incorporated into the award. Once incorporated, then as part of the award, a decision comes within the ambit of the remedies of Article 50 (interpretation), Article 51 (remedies), and Article 52 (annulment). Equally, the provisions of Article 53 dealing with finality and binding nature are applicable to awards and not directly applicable to decisions.409\n\nExh. CLA-91 (*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014), para. 19.\n\n310.\n\nThe question is whether, notwithstanding the lack of any provision in the Convention relating to the finality of decisions, a decision of a tribunal is nevertheless final and *res judicata.* The majority in *ConocoPhillips* concluded that decisions were *res judicata,* and not just when they are incorporated into the final award. After identifying the decisions that it had made, the tribunal said: \"It is established as a matter of principle and practice that such decisions that resolve points in dispute between the Parties have *res judicata* effect.\"410\n\n*Ibid,* para. 21.\n\n311.\n\nIn the view of the present Tribunal, to the extent that the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal was stating that all decisions of ICSID tribunals are *res judicata,* the statement is, at the very least, too broad. Tribunals make decisions on procedural matters, on provisional measures, all of which are subject to being reviewed, reconsidered and revised, notwithstanding the absence of anything in the Convention authorizing this. Thus, the mere fact that something is characterized as a decision of a tribunal cannot automatically make it *res judicata.*\n\n312.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that a decision is binding on the parties does not mean the same thing as saying that it is *res judicata.* A leading text on *res judicata* in English law explains it this way: \"Where a final judicial decision has been pronounced on the merits by an English or (with certain exceptions) a foreign judicial tribunal with jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter, any party to such litigation, as against any other party (and in the case of a decision *in rem,* any person whatsoever, as against any other person) is estopped in any subsequent litigation from disputing such decision on the merits....\"411 The Tribunal has difficulty seeing how decisions of tribunals could have the character of *res judicata* as defined here when, under the Convention, they only attain that status under Article 53(1) when they are incorporated into the final award.\n\nSpencer Bower, Turner & Handley, *The Doctrine of Res Judicata,* 3rd ed., Butterworths, London (1996), page 4.\n\n313.\n\nDecisions of tribunals are of course binding within the scope of the proceedings, but this does not make them *res judicata.* That is so with procedural orders and provisional measures as pointed out earlier. An essential feature of *res judicata* is that the judgment in question produces effects on the parties outside the proceedings in which it is granted. But decisions of tribunals only have effect within the proceedings until they have been incorporated into the final award.\n\n314.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the structure and architecture of the ICSID Convention itself. Contracting States have an obligation to recognize only an award as binding (Art. 54(1)); recognition and enforcement is contemplated only in respect of an award (Art. 54(2)); only awards can be challenged through annulment proceedings (Art. 52). The proper inference to be drawn from these provisions is that only the Contracting State that is a party to the proceedings is under an obligation to recognize decisions of a tribunal as binding. Thus, decisions cannot have legal consequences outside the ICSID proceedings in which they are issued (i.e. they cannot be recognized and enforced and they cannot be challenged through annulment). Indeed, if decisions were *res judicata* before incorporation in the final award, then the requirement of incorporation into the final award under Article 48(3) would be redundant.\n\n315.\n\nIn the absence of any prohibition in the Convention or the Arbitration Rules on the question of reopening decisions, in the view of the Tribunal, it is not possible to draw any conclusions *a priori* about the question of reopening. There is nothing preventing a tribunal from making it clear that it considers that its decisions are final and not subject to reopening. This appears to be what the tribunal in *Electrabel* v. *Hungary* had in mind when it said, \"several decisions and reasons contained in this Decision are intended by the Tribunal to be final and not to be re-visited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitration proceedings.\"412 But a tribunal cannot confer a status on its decisions that they do not have under the *lex arbitri.*\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19), Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability dated November 30, 2012, para. 10.1\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the decision of the majority in *Perenco* v. *Ecuador* which endorsed the conclusion of the majority in *ConocoPhdlips* that decisions are *res judicata.* The *Perenco* tribunal states that the *ConocoPhillips* conclusion on the legal effect of decisions \"fits within a well-established view as to the effect to be given to decisions made during the course of a phased arbitration such as the present one,\" but it offers no additional reasoning on which that conclusion can be based.413\n\nThe *Perenco* tribunal also cites to other decisions of investment tribunals, including *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3) (Decision on Mexico\u2019s Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings dated lune 26, 2002), and *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19 (Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability dated November 30, 2012), but none of those cases dealt with a power to reopen.\n\n317.\n\nMoreover, the *Perenco* tribunal goes out of its way to say that it is not dealing with facts similar to those in *ConocoPhillips,* where there was an allegation of recently discovered evidence that would justify reopening an award under Article 51.414 While expressing some sympathy415 with the approach taken by Professor Abi-Saab in his dissent in *ConocoPhillips,* who had concluded that there was a specific power in the tribunal to reopen in the circumstances of that case, the *Perenco* tribunal stated \"the facts in the *ConocoPhillips* case, in the view of this Tribunal, are so far removed as to deprive Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s views of any relevance to the instant case.\"416 In short, while rejecting the idea of a general power to reopen, the *Perenco* tribunal appears to avoid expressing a view on whether there would be a specific power to reopen in the light of particular facts.\n\nExh. RLA-84 (*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Ecuador\u2019s Reconsideration Motion dated April 10, 2015), para. 50.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 82.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 87.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that it is incorrect to characterize the decisions of ICSID tribunals, as opposed to their awards, as *res judicata.* They are binding within the scope of the proceedings but do not impose obligations upon the parties or other Contracting States outside the proceedings as is the case with awards that are *res judicata.* However, even if the conclusion were that decisions have *res judicata* status this would not provide a sufficient answer to the question whether a tribunal has a power to reopen its decisions. If the decision that the Claimant wishes to have reopened were *res judicata,* then by analogy with Article 51, it might be reopened in defined circumstances. If it were not *res judicata,* then *a fortiori* it could be reopened without the constraints of the requirements of Article 51.\n\n319.\n\nSince there is nothing in the ICSID Convention that prohibits the reopening of decisions, the starting point is the general power of the Tribunal under Article 41(1) of the Convention to determine its own competence. Article 44 of the Convention also grants a power to a tribunal to decide \"any question of procedure\" that is not covered in the Convention or the Arbitration Rules or agreed by the parties. The *ConocoPhillips* tribunal did not see this as a basis for admitting a reconsideration request, stating that Article 44 \"cannot be seen as conferring a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision.\"417\n\nExh. CLA-91 (*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration dated March 10, 2014), para. 22. In its second reconsideration decision, the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal elaborated on the substance/procedure distinction without changing its view, paras. 22-23. The dissenting arbitrator discusses this matter at paras. 44-45.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find this reasoning compelling. It is of the view that a power to reopen a decision has both procedural and substantive aspects, involving a procedural right to bring a request for reconsideration and the substantive question of what is to be done with such a request. Nor does it see that the specific reference in Article 44 to \"any question of procedure\" trammels the broader power of a tribunal under Article 41 to determine its own competence. The question for the Tribunal is not whether there is a specific power to reconsider under the Convention - clearly there is not - but whether in the absence of a specific power the right of a tribunal to determine its own competence has been limited. The Tribunal also takes the view that exercising a power to reopen in certain limited circumstances has practical advantages. It avoids having the Tribunal decide issues on the merits on the basis of a decision which has been seriously called into question, and then have the parties wait until the whole matter has been included in its final award before having its decision reopened or subject to annulment, thus potentially wasting the time and expense that has been incurred since the Tribunal became aware that its decision could be called into question. Efficiency grounds alone suggest that there may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has made.\n\n321.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal is only concerned with whether in light of the specific circumstances of this case it should exercise a power to reopen. The two grounds specifically raised by the Claimant are an alleged error of law in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision and the subsequent coming to light of a fact existing prior to the Decision within the knowledge of the Respondent, which the Respondent had wilfully withheld from the Tribunal.\n\n322.\n\nIn exercising a power to reopen a decision, a tribunal should be guided by, although not bound by, the limitations on reopening that apply to awards. Whatever the power the tribunal has to reconsider a decision that power must at least extend to the grounds for reopening an award in Article 51. But such a power should not be seen as unlimited. As stated earlier, the decisions made by ICSID tribunals in the course of a case are binding, and it would lead to considerable uncertainty if tribunals were to assert an unconstrained power to reopen any decisions made. A decision of an ICSID tribunal cannot be considered to be merely a draft that can be reopened at will.\n\n323.\n\nIn *Quiborax,* an allegation of illegality at the time of making the investment that was unknown by the respondent at the jurisdictional phase was seen to have the potential for reopening the jurisdictional decision.418 Subsequent knowledge of facts that undermine the basis for the decision was in part the basis of Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s dissent in *ConocoPhillips.* And it was this particular ground that the *Perenco* tribunal said made Professor Abi-Saab\u2019s dissent not relevant to the facts of *Perenco.*\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v. Plurinational State of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2), Award dated September 16, 2015, paras. 129-130.\n\n324.\n\nIn the present case, the allegation is that the Tribunal reached its decision without knowledge of material facts which had been deliberately withheld by one of the Parties, and that with the knowledge of those facts the Tribunal might have reached a different decision. In the view of the Tribunal, such an allegation if proved would justify reopening its decision not to order payment of any amount owing to SCB HK by TANESCO.\n\n**3. Should the Tribunal reopen its Decision in the present case?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Claimant argues that in the December 13, 2013 Letter to the Tribunal, the Respondent misled the Tribunal in two important ways: first, while stating that there had been no deterioration in SCB HK\u2019s position as a result of further developments in Tanzania, it had failed to disclose that it had engaged in discussions for the release of the monies in the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP and; secondly, it failed to disclose that it had agreed with IPTL to make payments to IPTL based on the full tariff under the PPA in contradiction of the position taken in this arbitration that the tariff had been incorrectly calculated.\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal was not misled by the December 13, 2013 Letter, and that the alleged new facts would have had no impact on the Tribunal\u2019s Decision and furthermore that the Claimant was aware of these facts and did not itself disclose them to the Tribunal.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider first what was disclosed in the Respondent\u2019s Letter of December 13, 2013, what was in fact known by the Respondent at that time, and what impact this might have had on the Tribunal\u2019s Decision. It will then consider the state of knowledge of the Claimant at the relevant time.\n\n328.\n\nOn November 27, 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, as follows:\n\nSCB HK has been informed that Tanesco has now entered into an agreement with IPTL (through PAP) which purports to settle the outstanding tariff payments under the PPA which are in issue in these proceedings thereby facilitating the release of the funds placed in escrow by the GOT as security for Tanesco\u2019s obligations under the PPA [...]. The agreement between PAP/IPTL and Tanesco has not been disclosed to SCB HK.\n\n329.\n\nIn its December 13, 2013 Letter, written in response to the Claimant\u2019s letter of November 27, 2013, the Respondent said:\n\nSCB HK alleges an agreement by PAP to sell electricity to TANESCO at a reduced tariff compared to the PPA. But that is not a new development or a change in the status quo. SCB has objected since 2009 that the Provisional liquidator was selling electricity to TANESCO at a reduced tariff compared to the PPA. SCB HK has neither demonstrated a change in existing practice nor that the continuing sale of electricity results in a \"deterioration\" in SCB HK\u2019s position.\n\nLater in the December 13, 2013 Letter, the Respondent said:\n\nSCB HK next claims that a continuation of an agreement respecting payment of a reduced tariff will facilitate the release of the funds held in the escrow account. SCB HK provides no evidence in support of this claim. In any event, TANESCO is not a party to Escrow Agreement between GOT, IPTL and the Bank of Tanzania; TANESCO has no control over that account [... ]\n\nThe essence of these exchanges was recorded in paragraphs 85 through 89 of the Decision.\n\n330.\n\nThe December 13, 2013 Letter neither admits nor denies that there was an agreement between TANESCO and IPTL/PAP to settle the outstanding tariff payments under the PPA, but by responding to the allegation of such an agreement by referring to the arrangement that the Tribunal was aware of, under which IPTL sold electricity to PAP at reduced rates, the letter leaves the clear impression that no such new agreement existed. Furthermore, TANESCO\u2019s response to the allegation that there was an agreement facilitating the release of the funds held in escrow by saying that since SCB HK had produced no proof of any such arrangement there was nothing to respond to, and that the Escrow Account was beyond its control, equally gave the impression that there was no new agreement and that it knew nothing about the Escrow Account.\n\n331.\n\nYet, on October 3, 2013, some two months before it wrote this letter, the Respondent had concluded an agreement to settle the tariff dispute and not on the basis of the reduced tariff referred to by the Respondent, but on the basis of the full tariff (the Respondent\u2019s obligation to pay the full tariff has been contested by the Respondent throughout these proceedings). Furthermore, the minutes of the meeting of October 3, 2013, between TANESCO and IPTL/PAP, at which the 2013 Settlement Agreement was reached, show that TANESCO participated with IPTL in a joint recommendation that \"[m]onies in the escrow account be released to IPTL as soon as possible.\"419\n\nExh. C-314 (Minutes of October 3, 2013 meeting between TANESCO and IPTL).\n\n332.\n\nIn short, while in its December 13, 2013 Letter the Respondent had given the impression that there was no agreement in existence relating to the sale of electricity (other than the agreement of which the Tribunal was already aware under which IPTL/PAP provided electricity to TANESCO at reduced rates), it failed to disclose that there was in fact a new Settlement Agreement entered into by TANESCO on October 3, 2013, under which IPTL/PAP would provide electricity to TANESCO with TANESCO paying the full tariff. And while TANESCO claimed in its December 13, 2013 Letter that it had no control over the Escrow Account, it failed to disclose that it had already recommended jointly with IPTL/PAP that the funds in the Escrow Account be released to IPTL/PAP and that some 8 days before the letter was written all of the funds in the Escrow Account had been released.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal has no difficulty in concluding that the failure of the Respondent to disclose these facts was anything other than deliberate. The Respondent knew of the 2013 Settlement Agreement: it had entered into it. Where in the course of proceedings a party that disputes its liability under an agreement goes ahead and settles the same claim with a third party on precisely the terms it is disputing under that agreement, then the party has an obligation to disclose that settlement to the tribunal.420 It is no answer to fall back on some notion of burden of proof and say that the other party has an obligation to prove the existence of such an agreement. Silence here was not an option. The Respondent had an obligation to disclose these matters to the Tribunal.\n\nIn most judicial systems rules of professional conduct would place counsel under an obligation to the court to make such disclosure.\n\n334.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal can only conclude that the response of the Respondent on the question of a new agreement with IPTL/PAP and the status of the Escrow Account was misleading.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the state of knowledge of the Claimant at the relevant times. The Respondent argues that the Claimant was in fact aware of the matters now claimed to be new material facts and deliberately refrained from disclosing them itself to the Tribunal. This is denied by the Claimant.\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the actual factual situation as set out by the Parties is unclear and even at times self-contradictory. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that there is proof that SCB HK was aware of the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL/PAP. In its letter of November 27, 2013, the Claimant indicates that it had been informed of the existence of an agreement settling the tariff dispute and facilitating the release of the Escrow Funds and states that the agreement had not been disclosed to it. It could be inferred from the fact that the Administrative Receiver, Martha Renju, had a copy of the agreement when she filed a request for an injunction to prevent the monies in the Escrow Account from being dispersed, some ten days before the Claimant wrote its November 27 letter421 that the Claimant must have had some knowledge of the 2013 Settlement Agreement. But there is no evidence that the Claimant knew that the Escrow Account had in fact been emptied.\n\nExh. R-164 (Plaint of Martha Renju vs. PAP and VIP in Commercial Case No. 123 of 2013 dated September 6, 2013).\n\n337.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to negotiations between Mr. Casson of SCB HK and Mr. Sethi of PAP on November 13, 2013, as related by Mr. Casson in his witness statement in proceedings before the Commercial Court in London where he stated that during such negotiations:\n\n[I]t was made clear [to him] by Mr Sethi that \"there was no cash available to SCB HK because USD$75,000,000 was being paid to settle PAP\u2019s purchase of VIP\u2019s 30% shareholding in IPTL\" and that \"SCB HK [would have] received no cash now because (Mr Sethi said) none of the USD$100,000,000 sitting in the escrow account would be left after paying VIP, the Tanzania Revenue Authority and \u2018other creditors\u2019.\"422\n\nResp. PHB2, para. 51.\n\n338.\n\nThe full import of what was being said by Mr. Casson is not entirely clear and he was never called as a witness before this Tribunal. What he appeared to be saying is that he learned from Mr. Sethi that there was an intention to pay US$ 75 million to settle PAP\u2019s purchase of VIP\u2019s shareholding and that after that was done nothing would be left of the US$ 100 million that was in the escrow account. That information may well have prompted the letter of the Claimant to the Tribunal on November 27, 2013.\n\n339.\n\nWhat the statement by Mr. Casson does not show is that the Escrow Account had been emptied at that time; indeed Mr. Sethi stated that there was US$ 100 million sitting in the Escrow Account. And it certainly does not show that TANESCO had been involved in approving the release of the Escrow Funds, something that was quite contrary to TANESCO\u2019s assertion in the December 13, 2013 Letter that it had no control over the Escrow Account. Moreover, Mr. Sethi\u2019s alleged statement says nothing about the terms of any settlement of the tariff dispute.423 As a result, the Tribunal cannot agree that Mr. Casson\u2019s witness statement supports a claim of knowledge by SCB HK either in respect of the emptying of the Escrow Account or the settlement of the tariff dispute.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 51.\n\n340.\n\nFinally, it is relevant to note that it would have been illogical for the Claimant not to have brought the terms of the 2013 Settlement Agreement and the fact the Escrow Account had been emptied to the attention of the Tribunal immediately, had it been informed of these facts prior to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision. The Respondent\u2019s primary position throughout this long arbitration was that it was not obliged to pay the full tariff to SCB HK (who stepped into the shoes of IPTL). In the months leading up to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision, it resolved to pay the full tariff to IPTL. It is inconceivable that the Claimant would not have sought to capitalise on that reversal of position by the Respondent in its submissions to this Tribunal had it known about it.\n\n341.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to prove that SCB HK had knowledge of the facts which the Respondent had withheld from the Tribunal in its December 13, 2013 Letter.\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that SCB HK was negligent in failing to make further enquiries about the new agreement and puts weight on the statement of counsel for SCB HK at the August Hearing that it may have been a tactical mistake not to have requested more documents and other information.424 If SCB HK had known of the facts that have now come to light, then failure to bring them to the attention of the Tribunal would no doubt have been negligent. However, given the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that there is no evidence of such knowledge by SCB HK, it is difficult to characterize SCB HK\u2019s conduct as negligent. SCB HK informed the Tribunal on November 27, 2013 of the possibility of a settlement of the tariff dispute and the potential for the release of the funds in the Escrow Account. But what it received in response by way of the Respondent\u2019s December 13, 2013 Letter was an implicit denial of any new agreement and a statement that suggested that TANESCO had no involvement with the Escrow Account. While with hindsight SCB HK might have wished that it had pushed further, the Tribunal considers that, in light of the Respondent\u2019s December 13, 2013 Letter, it had no obligation to do so and thus its actions cannot be characterized as negligent.\n\nTr., August 19, 2015, page 167, lines 24-25.\n\n343.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that SCB HK was negligent in respect of its lack of knowledge of the fact that TANESCO had settled the tariff dispute with IPTL on the basis of the full tariff or that the funds had been released from the Escrow Account.\n\n344.\n\nNevertheless, the question arises whether the existence of the 2013 Settlement Agreement between TANESCO and IPTL to settle the tariff dispute and the status of the Escrow Account were material to the conclusion that the Tribunal would not make an order for payment of the amounts owing to SCB HK under the PPA.\n\n345.\n\nWhat the Tribunal knew or believed at the time of its Decision was: first, that the Respondent contested any obligation to pay the full tariff under the PPA and would not pay that or a reduced amount in the absence of a decision by this Tribunal; second, that although the winding up petition and the administration petition for IPTL had been withdrawn, the situation in the courts of Tanzania was unclear and that the prospect of the appointment of a liquidator was at least regarded by TANESCO as a real possibility; and third, that some protection for the interests of SCB HK in collecting any judgment remained because of the existence of funds within the Escrow Account.\n\n346.\n\nWhat the Tribunal was not able to do was to assess the impact of the Respondent having agreed to pay the full tariff in its 2013 Settlement Agreement with IPTL/PAP, the impact of the fact that IPTL/PAP had now received substantial funds under the 2013 Settlement Agreement which reduced even further the likelihood of the appointment of a liquidator, and that the Escrow Account had been emptied. In short, the context in which the Decision of the Tribunal was made was substantially different from that which the Tribunal had been led to believe.\n\n347.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal considers that the facts that the Respondent failed to disclose in its December 13, 2013 Letter were material and would have had an impact on its decision not to make an order for payment. That decision was based to a significant extent on the likelihood that priorities of claims would have to be determined in the courts of Tanzania in the context of the appointment of a liquidator. The facts that the Respondent had kept from the Tribunal change that assumption.\n\n348.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, grounds for reopening its decision not to make an order for payment of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK under the PPA have been established. The fact that TANESCO had agreed to settle the invoice dispute with IPTL on the basis of the full tariff, the fact that IPTL was now in receipt of sufficient funds to pay its creditors and the fact that the Escrow Account had been emptied, were all material to the decision taken by the Tribunal, and all of these facts had been withheld by the Respondent from the Tribunal.\n\n349.\n\nIn light of this conclusion that grounds for reopening have been established, the Tribunal has no need to consider whether it should reopen its Decision on the basis of an alleged error of law.\n\n**4. The consequences of reopening the Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal must now consider the consequences of reopening its Decision of February 12, 2014. The decision that the Tribunal would only make a declaration of the amount owing to SCB HK and not make an order for payment, was made in light of the circumstances known to the Tribunal at that time.\n\n351.\n\nThese circumstances were:\n\n\u2022 That SCB HK\u2019s security interest had not been registered and that the effect of non-registration on priority amongst creditors was a matter that would have to be determined by Tanzanian courts;\n\n\u2022 That although the request for the appointment of a liquidator had been withdrawn, at least on the basis of the assertions of the Respondent, the appointment of a liquidator and the resumption of proceedings to wind up IPTL remained a real likelihood;\n\n\u2022 That if a liquidator were appointed then the issue of priority among creditors would be a live one;\n\n\u2022 That the Escrow Account, which had been set up to hold monies that would be paid out to settle that tariff dispute once the right of the parties were determined, had substantial funds in it;\n\n\u2022 That TANESCO was awaiting the decision of this Tribunal in order to resolve the tariff dispute.\n\n352.\n\nThe potential for the appointment of a liquidator was a predominant concern of the Tribunal in its Decision and had an impact on what was dealt with and decided. Considering whether the Tribunal should deal with the effect of non-registration of SCB HK\u2019s security the Tribunal said:\n\n170. As matters stand today, the fact that SCB HK failed to register a charge over future book debts in relation to clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed does not have any effect on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or the relief requested by SCB HK in these proceedings. This is because there is currently no liquidator or administrator appointed in respect of IPTL.\n\n171. The Tribunal nonetheless considers that it would be prudent to rule upon the effect of non-registration in the event that a liquidator or administrator were appointed in respect of IPTL and the history of these proceedings suggests that the *status quo* is liable to change. This issue has, moreover, been the object of extensive submissions and expert evidence from both Parties.\n\n353.\n\nAnd then later the Tribunal went on to say:\n\n241. The potential appointment of a liquidator and the resumption of proceedings in Tanzania for the winding up of IPTL would have consequences for any order that might be made by this Tribunal. An order by the Tribunal that TANESCO pay a specific sum to SCB HK, which would be enforceable in domestic courts, would potentially interfere with the question of priority amongst creditors, which is a matter for a liquidator and Tanzanian courts to decide. By contrast, a declaration that TANESCO owes a specific sum under the PPA leaves to the Tanzanian courts any question of priority amongst creditors.\n\n354.\n\nThe concern of the Tribunal was that, given the likelihood that the liquidation of IPTL would be back before the courts of Tanzania, the Tribunal should not make an order for the payment of a sum of money that would be binding in Tanzania and thus potentially interfere with the jurisdiction of a liquidator and the Tanzanian courts to determine priority amongst creditors.\n\n355.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether that concern remains valid in light of the actual circumstances that have been now brought to its attention. Given that TANESCO has agreed to pay the equivalent of the full amount owing under the tariff dispute to IPTL/PAP, the possibility of IPTL being placed in liquidation seems much more remote. The Respondent\u2019s assertion in the December 13, 2013 Letter that \"nothing would stop the disgruntled creditors of IPTL from filing their own winding up or administrative petitions\" loses credibility once it is known, as the Respondent did, that there had been an agreement to pay IPTL the equivalent of the full amount that SCB HK claims in the tariff dispute. With IPTL receiving such an amount, it is unclear who the \"disgruntled creditors\" would be. Certainly in its submissions to the Tribunal on recalculation, the Respondent has not identified any potential \"disgruntled creditors.\"\n\n356.\n\nAs a result, the assumption that if the Tribunal were to make an order for payment of the amount owing to SCB HK by TANESCO it would be interfering with the rights of a liquidator and the Tanzanian courts to determine priorities as between creditors was based on information that was incorrect. The potential for IPTL to be placed into liquidation that led to concerns about the determination of priorities among creditors was not as it had been portrayed to be. In making its decision, the Tribunal had proceeded on the basis of an assumption that, if it had been in possession of the correction information, it would not have made.\n\n357.\n\nFurthermore, the protection of the Claimant\u2019s interests merely through a declaration of an amount owing has less credibility now that the fund that had been held against the settlement of the tariff dispute has been emptied, and TANESCO has apparently agreed to pay the equivalent of the amount that SCB HK was claiming in these proceedings to IPTL/PAP. On both counts, the Claimant\u2019s position on the ground is much less secure than it was believed to be by the Tribunal when it made its Decision. The Respondent\u2019s assertion in its December 13, 2013 Letter that, \"there has been no material change in SCB HK\u2019s \u2018position on the ground\u2019 in Tanzania as a result of Tanzanian court rulings\" would have been viewed much differently by the Tribunal if the Respondent had disclosed that it had agreed with IPTL/PAP to pay it the equivalent of the full amount claimed by SCB HK in the tariff dispute and that the Escrow Account had been emptied.\n\n358.\n\nIn short, in concluding in its Decision that it could not make an order for payment in favour of SCB HK, the Tribunal was relying on what it believed to be facts, which were not true, and assumptions based on submissions made to it that omitted relevant information and were not correct. As a result of the undisclosed 2013 Settlement Agreement, IPTL/PAP was in a much more secure financial position than it had been in the past and thus the possibility of it being placed in liquidation was not as it was represented to the Tribunal.\n\n359.\n\nThus, the concern of the Tribunal about interfering with the issue of priority amongst creditors that was a matter for a liquidator and the Tanzanian courts was essentially unfounded. And the security that the Escrow Account provided SCB HK that there were funds to meet in whole or in part any amount that was determined to be owing to it had dissipated. If the Tribunal had known the true facts, it would not have reached the conclusion that a declaration without any order for payment would be sufficient. Accordingly, the Tribunal reverses that conclusion.\n\n360.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal decides that in addition to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK, it can also make an order for payment of that amount.\n\n**B. Recalculation of the tariff**\n----------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nIn its Decision, the Tribunal decided that, \"the tariff must be recalculated to reflect the fact that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution was by way of shareholder loan and not by way of paid up share capital\"425 and ordered the Parties to attempt to agree on a recalculated tariff taking into account this consideration and any other relevant conclusions set out in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision. No such discussions took place between the Parties and thus there was no agreement on a recalculated tariff.\n\nDecision, para. 324.\n\n362.\n\nIn its submissions on the recalculation of the tariff, the Claimant proposed three alternative approaches:\n\n\u2022 First, the Claimant argued that in view of TANESCO having agreed to pay IPTL/PAP a tariff equivalent to the amount claimed by SCB HK without any recalculation, there was no need to recalculate the tariff. This would result in an amount owing of US$ 201.4 million, which with interest would be US$ 214.6 million.426\n\n\u2022 Second, the Claimant argued that, as an alternative, the tariff could still be based on an IRR of 22.31%, but calculated on the basis of a shareholder loan and not paid up share capital. This would result in a reduction in the tariff paid over the life of the project of US$ 81.6 million and an amount owing of US$ 148.4 million427\n\n\u2022 Third, the Claimant argued,428 on the basis of the Expert Report of Colin Johnson, that the correct calculation for an IRR based on a shareholder loan and not paid up share capital, taking account of the greater risk involved in a shareholder loan, would be 26.08%. This would result in a reduction of the capacity charge for the period 2007-2014 of US$ 1.4 million.\n\nAs adjusted in Cl. PHB2, para. 13.\n\nCl. PHB2, para. 13. Fourth Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated October 30, 2015, page 7.\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 91(5).\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent argued as an initial matter that it owed no obligation to SCB HK because the statutory assignment to SCB HK was ineffective as a matter of Tanzanian law. On the specific question of recalculation, the Respondent argued that, on the basis of the Expert Report of James Nicholson, taking account of the different risks entailed with a shareholder loan rather than paid up share capital, the tariff should be calculated on the basis of an IRR of 13.18% (subsequently adjusted to 13.69%).429 The Respondent then concluded that, applying that tariff and taking into account amounts already paid, SCB HK owes TANESCO US$ 48.1 million.\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., para. 178.\n\n364.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal rejects the argument of the Claimant that there should be no recalculation of the tariff because of the 2013 Settlement Agreement under which TANESCO agreed to pay to IPTL in purported settlement of the tariff dispute an amount equivalent to the full amount claimed by SCB HK in this dispute.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal need not go into the reasons for this settlement or any justification of the amount, all of which was disputed by the Parties. The Tribunal had already decided in its Decision that the tariff had been incorrectly calculated on the basis of paid up share capital when it should have been calculated on the basis of a shareholder loan. No arguments were made to the Tribunal to reopen that decision, nor does the Tribunal see any justification for doing so. Accordingly, the amount paid under the 2013 Settlement Agreement, which provides for payment based on a tariff calculated on the basis of a rate of return on paid up capital and not a shareholder loan, cannot be in conformity with the decision that the Tribunal has already reached.\n\n366.\n\nAt the same, the Tribunal rejects the argument of the Respondent that there is no need to recalculate the tariff because the assignment under which SCB HK acquired its rights to the claim currently before the Tribunal was ineffective under Tanzanian law. The Tribunal has already concluded in its Decision that there had been a valid statutory assignment to SCB HK even though that assignment had not been registered.430 Again, no argument was made to the Tribunal as to why that decision should be reopened and the Tribunal sees no justification for doing so.\n\n*\"The Tribunal concludes that Clause 3.2.1 of the Security Deed is a valid statutory assignment of IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA to SCB HK. This was finally accepted by the Respondent in oral submissions at the hearing on March**14, 2013\"* (footnote omitted). Decision, para. 151.\n\n367.\n\nIn light of this, the task for the Tribunal is to determine which should be adopted - one of the two approaches to recalculation put forward by the Claimant or the approach to recalculation put forward by the Respondent, or some other approach.\n\n368.\n\nIn considering these alternatives, the Tribunal recalls the reasons it gave in its Decision for deciding that the tariff must be recalculated. At paragraph 271 of that Decision, the Tribunal said:\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that a shareholder\u2019s loan would cost a substantial amount less than true equity over the life of the project, even if both earned exactly the same rate of return. This means that in replacing equity by a shareholder loan, IPTL was incurring less costs than the costs used for the calculation of the Capacity Payment.\n\n369.\n\nAnd later in the same paragraph, the Tribunal said:\n\nThe difference in the global cost - on which the Capacity Payment\u2019s calculation was based - is the economy realized in tax payments, which has not been taken into account in the calculation of the Capacity Payment [...]. Whilst the Tribunal has not made its own calculation of the amount in taxes, it is clear that in principle TANESCO was effectively reimbursing IPTL for taxes that would only have been incurred if the project sponsors had contributed paid-up capital instead of shareholders\u2019 loans.\n\n370.\n\nIn short, it was clear to the Tribunal that with a tariff based on paid-up equity the Claimant was being compensated for costs it had not incurred. Thus, the negotiation exercise mandated by the Tribunal was to determine a tariff based on a shareholder loan that eliminated those effects of a tariff based on paid-up capital.\n\n371.\n\nIn ordering the Parties to negotiate a new tariff, the Tribunal set out the parameters for that negotiation:\n\nFirst, a 22.31% IRR would not be appropriate because it had been calculated on the basis of paid-up equity and not a shareholder loan.\n\nSecond, a 0% IRR would not be appropriate.\n\nThird, the calculation of the tariff could not be based on any new assumptions, such as the provision of further capital or further shareholder loans by IPTL.\n\nFourth, the rate of return for a shareholder loan had to be higher than the return on senior debt.431\n\nDecision, paras. 339-343.\n\n372.\n\nMeasured against these criteria, the Tribunal finds problems with the IRR of 26.08% proposed by the Claimant and the IRR of 13.69% proposed by the Respondent. In the case of the former, the approach taken by Mr. Johnson was not limited to the difference between the amount that TANESCO would have to pay if the tariff had been calculated on the basis of a shareholder loan and what it would pay when the tariff was based on paid-up share capital. His option of 26.08% was based on what the parties would have negotiated if they had abandoned 22.31%.\n\n373.\n\nIn short, to get to 26.08%, the Claimant, on the basis of Mr. Johnson\u2019s report, has to make assumptions about the risk profile of building a power plant in Tanzania at that time, the risk profile of a shareholder loan compared with the risk profile of paid-up capital, and the capacity payment required to make the project viable.432 All of these involve assumptions about what the parties would have decided if they had negotiated on the basis of a shareholder loan instead of paid-up share capital.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated November 10, 2014, para. 3.15.\n\n374.\n\nThere is a similar problem with the approach of the Respondent\u2019s expert, James Nicholson. He indicated in his report of February 13, 2015, that he had asked himself the following question: \"What rate of return would IPTL and TANESCO have agreed upon as of September 1998 (i.e. the cut-off date in the Decision) had the structuring of the equity investment as a shareholder loan been known by both TANESCO and IPTL, all else equal.\"433 This, too, involves making assumptions about what the parties would have decided.\n\nSecond Expert Report of James Nicholson dated May 21, 2015, para. 1.11\n\n375.\n\nNeither of these approaches, then, focus on what the Tribunal had identified in its Decision as the principal problem with the tariff: it had been calculated on the basis of paid up equity and not on the basis of a shareholder loan with the result that \"in replacing equity by a shareholder loan, IPTL was incurring less costs than the costs used for the calculation of the Capacity Payment.\" And, as the Tribunal went on to say, \"in principle TANESCO was effectively reimbursing IPTL for taxes that would only have been incurred if the project sponsors had contributed paid-up capital instead of shareholders\u2019 loans.\"434\n\nDecision, para. 271.\n\n376.\n\nIn the parameters set for the recalculation, the Tribunal had said that \"the calculation of the tariff could not be based on any new assumptions\" yet both the 26.08% calculation of Mr. Johnson and the 13.69% calculation of Mr. Nicholson were based on assumptions of what the parties would have decided if they had abandoned the 22.31% IRR. Neither of these calculations focus on permitting TANESCO to recapture what it was paying in excess of the actual costs that IPTL was incurring.\n\n377.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s proposal of an IRR of 26.08% and an IRR of 13.69% proposed by the Respondent.\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the proposal of the Claimant for an unchanged IRR of 22.31% but based on a shareholder loan and not paid up share capital. As pointed out earlier, this would result in a reduction of US$ 81.6 million over the life of the project. The Claimant justifies this approach on the ground that the parties had agreed to an IRR of 22.31% in 1995 and thus the only change would be calculating it on the basis of a shareholder loan rather than paid up capital.435 The result would be a transfer of the tax savings from the use of a shareholder\u2019s loan to TANESCO.\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 197.\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimant nonetheless points out that using an IRR of 22.31% based on a shareholder loan does not achieve the same result as an IRR of 22.31% based on paid up share capital, in particular it would not permit IPTL to comply with all of its banking covenants, in particular the obligations with respect to the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).436 It was to rectify this shortfall that the IRR of 26.08% was proposed. But the Tribunal has already rejected that IRR on the ground that it involves making assumptions about what the parties would have decided if they had renegotiated the tariff.\n\n*Ibid,* paras. 205-208.\n\n380.\n\nRelying on the expert report of Colin Johnson, the Claimant indicates alternative IRRs of 17.19% and 21.25% and considers their ability to \"comply with the other requirements of the Facility Agreement and other financing documents.\"437 What the Claimant shows is that anything below 17.19% would require additional funding to be provided, and that only an IRR of 21.25% would be equivalent to an IRR of 22.31% in its compliance with banking covenants - that is, it would preserve the Senior Debt Coverage Ratio (DSCR), but not fulfill the obligations under the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).438\n\nCl. Tariff Sub., para. 103.\n\n*Ibid, see* table at page 38.\n\n381.\n\nIf an IRR of 22.31% is effective in returning the tax savings resulting from basing the IRR on paid-up share capital, on what basis can a claim to change the IRR to 21.5% be justified? The Claimant argues that the figure of 22.31% goes back to 1995 and was a key point in the Rugamelira letter of May 31, 1995, which was adopted by the ICSID 1 tribunal. While this Tribunal does not find that to be a conclusive consideration, it has difficulty seeing how a choice can be made of the 21.25% figure that is not arbitrary or making assumptions about what the parties would have done if they were renegotiating the tariff, something that was contrary to the parameters set out by the Tribunal in its Decision.\n\n382.\n\nHowever, the Respondent argues that an IRR of 22.31% is not permitted by the terms of the Decision. It focuses on the statement that \"the Tribunal does not believe that a tariff of 22.31% would be appropriate.\" But the Respondent takes this out of context ignoring the following sentence, which provides that such tariff \"was based on an assumption that IPTL\u2019s equity contribution could be made by way of shareholder loan, which the Tribunal has rejected.\" And the Respondent\u2019s argument also ignores the whole objective of the recalculation which the Respondent itself had advocated before the Tribunal.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert, David Ehrhardt, identified the issue as the \"trapped cash factor\" described as follows:\n\nThe model would have provided an entirely different payment schedule if IPTL were permitted to substitute a shareholder loan for the required 30 percent equity contribution. If a shareholder loan had been permitted in lieu of an equity contribution, the payments to shareholders would not have been subject to the dividend payment constraints, which would have eliminated or reduced the \"trapped cash\" and would have required a much smaller Capacity Payment to provide the agreed 22.31 percent, after-tax return on equity. Therefore, this model confirms that the required 30 percent equity contribution was required to consist of true equity, and not a shareholder loan.439\n\nIn its Decision, the Tribunal agreed with Mr. Ehrhardt and adopted his conclusion.440\n\nWitness statement of Mr. David Ehrhardt dated August 10, 2012,para. 111.\n\nDecision, para. 269.\n\n384.\n\nThus, the Respondent itself was saying that the IRR could remain the same, but the tariff should have been lower because payments to shareholders under a shareholder loan would not have been subject to dividend payment constraints.441 The fundamental point is that the tax savings that IPTL gained from the actual use of shareholder loans rather than equity should have been transferred to TANESCO. The objective of the recalculation was to transfer those tax savings to TANESCO and that was what the negotiations between the Parties were to be directed to.\n\nThe Tribunal had recognized in its Decision that the same rate of return could result in different outcomes when applied on the basis of a shareholder loan or paid up equity: *\"the Tribunal is persuaded that a shareholder\u2019s loan would cost a substantial amount less than true equity over the life of the project,* *even if both earned exactly the same rate of return*\" (emphasis added), Decision, para. 271.\n\n385.\n\nIn light of the fact that the tax savings are transferred to TANESCO on the basis of an IRR of 22.31% - the whole point of the recalculation - the Tribunal cannot see on what basis there is any justification for deviating from that IRR without speculating on what the Parties might have done under a theoretical negotiation at the time the PPA was entered into, had the Parties been on notice that shareholder loans rather than equity would be used. Both Parties have tried to do that in their arguments before the Tribunal but ultimately their approach is inconsistent with the parameters set out in the Decision. There is no basis in the Decision for permitting the Respondent to get both the benefit of the transfer of taxes as well as a further benefit from a reduction of the IRR.\n\n386.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concludes that the tariff should be determined on the basis of an IRR of 22.31% applied to a shareholder loan and accepts in this regard the Claimant\u2019s calculation of the amount owing to IPTL under the PPA, and hence to SCB HK, of US$ 148.4 million.442 That amount is the amount owing as of 30 September 2015, the latest information provided to the Tribunal, and that is the amount that will be ordered.\n\nCl. PHB2, para. 13. Fourth Expert Report of Colin Johnson dated October 30, 2015, page. 7.\n\n**C. Interest**\n---------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Parties dispute the interest rate to be applied to any amount owing under the Award. The Claimant takes the view that it should be three month LIBOR plus 4%, which it argues is the rate provided for in the PPA. Relying on the expert report of Mr. Nicholson, the Respondent argues that the rate should be one month LIBOR plus 2%. According to Mr. Nicholson, under the PPA, LIBOR plus 4% applied only to undisputed amounts and the Base Lending Rate of one month LIBOR plus 2% is more appropriate when as here the amounts in dispute relate to \"structural changes in the tariffs.\"443\n\nFirst Expert Report of James Nicholson dated February 13, 2015, para. 1.64. Second Expert Report of James Nicholson dated May 21, 2015, para. 6.4.\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s argument. The PPA makes clear that not only is it undisputed amounts that attract interest of LIBOR plus 4%,444 but disputed amounts once resolved also attract interest at that rate.445 No distinction is made between different kinds of disputes that would justify treating disputes relating to \"structural changes in the tariff\u2019 differently.\n\nExhs. C-4/R-1 (PPA), Clause 6.7(b) *\"calculated at the rate of 2% above Base Lending Bate.\"*\n\nExhs. C-4/R-1 (PPA), Clause 6.8(c) *\"calculated at the rate of 2% above Base Lending Rate.\"*\n\n389.\n\nWith respect to whether the rate should be one month or three month LIBOR, the Tribunal accepts that three month LIBOR, as used in the ICSID award model, is appropriate. The Tribunal has already noted446 that the ICSID 1 tribunal had endorsed the agreement of the parties that where there is an inconsistency between the PPA and the ICSID award model, the award model prevails.447\n\nDecision, para. 263.\n\nExhs. C-10/R-8 (ICSID 1 award), Appendix F \u2018Stipulation and Agreement\u2019, para. 2.: *\"The parties recognize that there are instances where the formulae, mechanisms, notes, or comments contained in the Financial Model differ from or supplement the terms of the PPA. Where such differences exist, the parties agree that the Financial Model shall govern and supersede the terms of the PPA. \"*\n\n390.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the interest rate on the amount owing under the PPA shall be three month LIBOR plus 4%. This interest rate shall not be compounded and thus is simple.\n\n**D. Shareholder loan as a percentage of equity contribution**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe Parties disagree over the proportion of the \"equity\" contribution of IPTL that was to be by way of shareholder loan. The Respondent had argued that it was 99.9%.448 Although it disagreed with this figure, arguing that it had been understood that IPTL\u2019s contribution would be made up of US$ 10 million by way of paid-up share capital and the balance by shareholder loan,449 the Claimant was prepared not to dispute the issue if the IRR was 22.31% on the basis of a shareholder loan.450 Since the Tribunal has decided that the IRR is 22.31%, the Claimant\u2019s concession applies and there is no need for any determination on this issue by the Tribunal.\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., paras. 252-255.\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 199 and 266.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 201.\n\n**E. Payments made by TANESCO into the Escrow Account**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that payments made into the Escrow Account operate to discharge its obligations under the PPA.451 The Claimant contests this by arguing that:452\n\n[O]n the proper construction of the PPA, payment into the Escrow Account pursuant to the above provisions does not discharge Tanesco\u2019s indebtedness under the PPA. Instead, the sums deposited in escrow merely provide security for Tanesco\u2019s payment obligations.\n\nThe Claimant seeks a declaration from the Tribunal confirming that payments into the Escrow Account do not discharge the obligation of TANESCO to SCB HK.453\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., paras. 153-154.\n\nCl. Tariff Rep., para. 150.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 392.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent\u2019s view. The Escrow Account was made up largely of monies deposited by TANESCO when there was a dispute.454 Paying into the Escrow Account when there was a dispute is referred to in the PPA as the payments being \"withheld.\"455 After the dispute was resolved, the amounts, now undisputed, were to be promptly paid. Thus, the discharge of TANESCO\u2019s obligations under the PPA would occur when the disputed amounts were paid, not when deposits were made to the Escrow Account.\n\nExhs. C-4/R-1 (PPA), Clause 6.8(b).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n394.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that amounts paid by TANESCO into the Escrow Account did not discharge TANESCO\u2019s obligations under the PPA and thus cannot be taken into account in assessing what TANESCO owes SCB HK. The Tribunal will thus make a declaration accordingly.\n\n**F. Payments to IPTL/PAP out of the Escrow Account**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nThe Claimant seeks a declaration that payments out of the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP did not discharge the debt payable by TANESCO under the PPA. This was in response to the Respondent\u2019s claim that since SCB HK had never objected to TANESCO discharging its obligations under the PPA by making payments into the Escrow Account, \"it follows... that the release of the funds in the Escrow to IPTL validly discharge Respondent\u2019s obligation under the PPA... \"456\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 123.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent\u2019s submission on this point. In its Decision, the Tribunal concluded that SCB HK was the statutory assignee of IPTL\u2019s rights under the PPA.457 In that capacity, SCB HK became \"the legal owner of the rights arising under the PPA\"458 and thus was able to take action to enforce those rights.\n\nDecision, para. 151.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 152.\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument that the statutory assignment was not valid is of no avail. Indeed, the Respondent itself recognizes that this argument is precluded by the Tribunal\u2019s Decision and it makes no claim to the reopening of the Decision.459 Since TANESCO\u2019s obligation under the PPA was to make payments to the holder of the legal rights under the PPA, it can only discharge its obligations by making payments to SCB HK as the legitimate holder of those rights by virtue of the assignment that the Tribunal has held to be valid. As a consequence, TANESCO cannot discharge its obligations to SCB HK by making payments to a third party.\n\nResp. Tariff Sub., para. 128.\n\n398.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Tariff, the Respondent appeared to back away from its position that monies paid out of the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP discharged its obligation to SCB HK.460 Nonetheless, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal will make the declaration requested by the Claimant that payment out of the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP did not discharge TANESCO\u2019s obligation to SCB HK under the PPA.\n\nResp. Tariff Rej., para.138.\n\n399.\n\nThe Claimant has also requested a declaration that payments made by TANESCO directly to IPTL/PAP since August 2013, other than payments made from the Escrow Account, do not discharge TANESCO\u2019s debt under the PPA. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that in its Decision, it concluded that TANESCO could not deduct from what it owed to SCB HK payments made to the Provisional Liquidator including capacity payments and bonus payments, but that SCB HK was not entitled to claim for amounts that covered the operation and maintenance of the plant because those represented expenses that SCB HK had not incurred.461 In short, TANESCO was not permitted to treat payments made to the Provisional Liquidator as discharging its debt under the PPA.\n\nDecision, paras. 375-377.\n\n400.\n\nThe same principle applies here. TANESCO cannot treat payments made to IPTL/PAP since August 2013 as discharging its obligations under the PPA. Accordingly, the Tribunal will make the requested declaration.\n\n**VI. Costs**\n-------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal will now deal with the issues of costs.\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n402.\n\nIn its costs submission, the Claimant submits that the Respondent should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by the Claimant, including the Claimant\u2019s legal fees and expenses, totalling \u00a3 2,416,244.72 (up to February 2014) and \u00a3 1,128,057.55 (between February 2014 and November 2015).462 The Claimant makes its claim based on the principle of \"costs follow the event\" and the Respondent\u2019s conduct in these proceedings.463\n\nCl. Costs Sub., paras. 63-65.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 5-62.\n\n403.\n\nIn its Tariff Rejoinder and Costs Submissions, the Respondent argues that the Claimant should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including the Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses, which have been broken down as follows:464\n\nFirst phase of the proceedings (September 2010 to February 2014):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal Fees (Mkono & Co.): | USD 4,720,000.00 |\n| Legal Fees (Hunton & Williams) | USD 5,316,535.00 |\n| Expenses (Hunton & Williams) | USD 355,620.32 |\n| Expenses (TANESCO) | USD 892,317.50 and GBP 53,000 |\n\nSecond phase of the proceedings (May 2014 to October 2015):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal Fees (Crax Law Partners/R.K. Rweyongeza & Co.) | USD 3,540,000.00 |\n| Legal Fees (Kellerhals Carrard) | CHF 955,081.00 |\n| Expenses (Crax Law Partners/R.K.

Tariff Rej., para. 261(6). Resp. Reply Costs Sub., Schedule A: Legal fees.\n\nResp. Reply Costs Sub., revised Schedule of Costs, Schedule B: Legal expenses. The Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s correction in its revised Schedule of Costs (Schedule B: Legal expenses) to the total expense of Crax Law Partners/R.K. Rweyongeza & Co. in USD.\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Tribunal should award costs \"according to the Parties\u2019 relative success\" and in light of the Parties\u2019 conduct.466 Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal should take into account the substantial costs of defending itself against the Claimant\u2019s request for reconsideration.467\n\nResp. Reply Costs Sub., paras. 9-18.\n\nResp. Costs Sub., paras. 10-12.\n\n405.\n\nIn its Reply Costs Submission, the Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the appropriate allocation of costs, and contends that the Respondent\u2019s costs are \"exorbitant and egregious in nature.\"468\n\nCl. Reply Costs Sub., paras. 1-2.\n\n406.\n\nBy letter dated February 5, 2016, the Respondent submits additional observations on the Claimant\u2019s Reply Costs Submission and requests that the Tribunal rule on the costs of the arbitration \"based on the information before it.\"469\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated February 5, 2016, page 5.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n408.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n409.\n\nIn making its determination on costs, the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the normal rule is that costs follow the event. However, seeking to apply that principle in the circumstances of this case creates some difficulty as both Parties won on important issues and also lost on other issues. In respect of allegations of misconduct the Tribunal does not see this as a matter warranting an award and notes that the Claimant was successful on the issue of reopening.\n\n410.\n\nIn the result, the Tribunal has decided that both Parties should bear their own costs and so orders.\n\n411.\n\nFor the reasons set out in the paragraph above, regarding claims for costs, the Tribunal has also concluded that the costs of the arbitration should also be shared by the Parties equally.\n\n412.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses are the following (in US$):\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses\n\nProf. McRae 254,775.02\n\nProf. Douglas 171,278.36\n\nProf. Stem 370,126.79\n\nOther direct expenses (estimated)470 157,336.26\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees 180,000.00\n\nTotal 1,133,516.43\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Award.\n\n413.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the Parties in equal parts. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed final financial statement, and the remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the advances they made.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n414.\n\nFor the reasons indicated here above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n**A. Jurisdiction to Reopen**\n\n1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to reopen its Decision of February 12, 2014, that it would not make an order for payment of any amount owed by TANESCO to SCB HK.\n\n2. The Tribunal decides that in addition to making a declaration of the amount owing by TANESCO to SCB HK, it will also make an order for payment of that amount.\n\n**B. Recalculation of the Tariff**\n\n3. The Tribunal decides that the tariff should be determined on the basis of an IRR of 22.31% applied to a shareholder loan. Therefore, the amount owed by TANESCO under the PPA as of September 30, 2015 is US$ 148.4 million.\n\n4. The Tribunal decides that the interest rate on the amount owing under the PPA shall be simple three month LIBOR plus 4%.\n\n**C. Other Declarations**\n\n5. The Tribunal declares that amounts paid by TANESCO into the Escrow Account did not discharge TANESCO\u2019s obligations under the PPA and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount that TANESCO owes SCB HK.\n\n6. The Tribunal declares that payment out of the Escrow Account to IPTL/PAP did not discharge TANESCO\u2019s obligation to SCB HK under the PPA and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount that TANESCO owes SCB HK.\n\n7. The Tribunal declares that payments made to IPTL/PAP since August 2013 do not discharge TANESCO\u2019s obligation to SCB HK under the PPA and thus cannot be used to reduce the amount that TANESCO owes SCB HK.\n\n**D. Other Claims**\n\n8. All the other claims are dismissed.\n\n**E. Order for Payment**\n\n9. The Tribunal orders that TANESCO pay to SCB HK the amount of US$ 148.4 million with simple interest at three month LIBOR plus 4% from September 30, 2015 until the date of this Award. Interest shall continue at the same rate until full payment is received.\n\n**F. Costs**\n\n10. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses and the Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares."}, {"Title": "Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay on Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2017-04-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay on Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.** Procedural Background\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 January 2017, Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (the \"**Applicant,**\" **\"Respondent\"** or **\"TANESCO\")** filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\")** an application for annulment (the **\"Application\")** of the award rendered on 12 September 2016 in *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v.

The annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on such date. The Parties were also informed that Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, Senior Legal Adviser, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn 25 February 2017, the Committee asked the Parties to indicate whether they would agree to a procedure whereby: (i) the 30-day deadline (set for 13 March 2017) under Rule 54(2) be extended for an additional period of 30 days in order for the Committee to rule on the continuance of the stay; (ii) the stay would remain in effect within that extended period; (iii) the Parties would file one round of submissions conferring among themselves to determine the dates for them; and (iv) the First Session would be held in London on 29 March 2017 to discuss both procedural aspects and the continuation of the stay.\n\n6.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted to the Committee the communications whereby the Parties reached an agreement on the timetable for the proceeding, as follows: on 10 March 2017, TANESCO to file its submission in support of the continuation of the stay; on 21 March 2017, SCB HK to file its response; and on 29 March 2017 an in-person Hearing to take place in London. The Parties further agreed that the 30-day deadline be extended for an additional period of 30 days in order for the Committee to rule on the continuance of the stay, the stay remaining in effect within this period.\n\n7.\n\nOn 3 March 2017, upon the Committee s proposal and with the agreement of the Parties, an in-person Hearing (the **\"First Session\")** was rescheduled for 30 March 2017.\n\n8.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, the Applicant filed its Submission in Support of a continuation of the provisional stay **(\"Stay Submission\")** and Annexes 27-42.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 March 2017, SCB HK filed its Reply to the Applicant's Stay Submission **(\"Stay Reply\"),** including exhibits LE-1 to LE-12 and Exhibits-001 to 060.\n\n10.\n\nThe First Session took place on 30 March 2017.

TANESCO claims that *\"continuation of the provisional stay on enforcement has become standard practice in ICSID annulment proceedings.\"2*\n\nStay Application, para 11.\n\n14.\n\nThe Applicant brings forward the following arguments: (i) the balance of both Parties' interests supports the maintenance of the stay; (ii) a lift of a stay would expose TANESCO to an irreparable harm deriving from double payment; (iii) a lift of the stay could also entail unjustified multiple recovery for SCB HK; and (iv) the existence of serious grounds for annulment also clearly supports the maintenance of the stay. The Committee will briefly address each of these arguments below.\n\n15.\n\nFirst, the Applicant contends that the balance of both Parties' interests supports the maintenance of the stay. The Applicant argues that in deciding on whether to maintain or terminate the stay on enforcement of an award, an *ad hoc* committee should take into consideration adverse economic consequences on either party and the balance of both parties *'* interests.3\n\nStay Submission, para 8, FN 9: ***\"Annex-27,*** MINE v.

In addition, the Applicant argues that the fact that enforcement proceedings in Tanzania have been stayed as recently as 27 February 2017 by consent of all parties to those proceedings (including SCB HK) pending the determination of the Application before the Committee, and confirmed in an Order of Munisi J, further supports TANESCO *'* s position on the continuance of the stay on enforcement of the Award under the ICSID Convention. The Applicant argues that having agreed to the stay in the Tanzanian courts, there is no basis for SCB HK to insist that the stay on enforcement of the Award be lifted by the Committee.4\n\nStay Submission, para 10.\n\n18.\n\nThe Applicant further argues that should the Committee confirm the Award, there is no element that would suggest a default by TANESCO in its payment obligations.\n\n19.\n\nIn addition, the Applicant argues that if the stay is lifted, TANESCO would be exposed to a risk of double payment, potentially jeopardizing the supply of electricity by Independent Power Tanzania Limited (\"IPTL\") under the Power Purchase Agreement dated 26 May 1995 (the \"PPA\") with TANESCO. In fact, TANESCO states that should *\"the Capacity Payment\"* payable pursuant to clause 5.1(a) of the PPA be paid into court, as requested by SCB HK in local enforcement proceedings, the same could not be paid to IPTL, which is currently performing its obligations under the PPA. Furthermore, it argues that TANESCO could still be forced to litigate enforcement proceedings in Tanzania and elsewhere while the Application is pending and SCB HK could obtain multiple recovery.5\n\nStay Submission, para 13.\n\n20.\n\nSecond, the Applicant states that a lift of the stay would expose TANESCO to an irreparable harm. If SCB HK is allowed to enforce the Award ordering TANESCO to pay tariffs, TANESCO would be exposed to a risk of double payment, since: (i) it has already paid tariffs totaling more than US$120 million to IPTL; (ii) it has been and still is paying additional tariffs under the PPA to IPTL from October 2013 onwards to date; (iii) any additional payments diverted from IPTL would cause irreparable harm, leaving millions of Tanzanian residents without electricity; and (iv) SCB HK would recover sums exceeding from four to twelve times the amount of its original alleged investment.6\n\nStay submission, para 19.\n\n21.\n\nThird, the Applicant argues that a lift of the stay would also entail unjustified multiple recovery for SCB HK. TANESCO refers to two proceedings which currently risk SCB HK being granted undue multiple recovery.\n\n22.\n\nThe first case referred to by the Applicant is before the High Court of England and Wales, in which SCB HK claims sums under the Loan Facility Agreement (dated 28 June 1997) against IPTL and current and previous shareholders. On 16 November 2016, Mr. Justice Flaux, rendered his judgment (the **\"Flaux J Judgment\")** in favor of SCB HK, awarding US$168,800,063.87.7 The Applicant states that on 9 February 2017, Mr. Justice Sehel registered the Flaux J Judgment and ordered that IPTL pay the sum to SCB HK.8 The Applicant further argues that should this Committee allow SCB HK to pursue enforcement of the Award, SCB HK would have the opportunity to recover the amount of the Flaux Judgment plus the sum allegedly due for tariffs which were meant to repay the debt under the Loan Facility Agreement under the Award.\n\nStay Submission para 21, Annex 17.\n\nStay Submission para 21, Annex 39.\n\n23.\n\nThe second set of proceedings, referred to by the Applicant, is the ICSID arbitration initiated against the United Republic of Tanzania, as the purported assignee of IPTL under the Implementation Agreement dated 8 June 1995 signed with IPTL. The Applicant argues that the claims are ultimately linked to the tariffs under the PPA and that SCB HK is claiming an additional amount of US$616,475,658 in that proceeding.9\n\nStay Submission, para 24, Annex 38.\n\n24.\n\nFourth, the Applicant argues that the existence of serious grounds for annulment also clearly supports the maintenance of the stay and that other committees have established that a request for continuation of a stay can be denied only if it is obvious that the application is *\"without any basis under the**[ICSID] Convention\"* and is purely *\"dilatory\"* in nature, which is not the case in this proceeding.10\n\nStay Submission, para 28, FN 56.\n\n**B.** Respondent on Annulment\n------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment opposes the Stay Request, stating mainly the following arguments: (i) TANESCO has no automatic right to a continuation of the stay; (ii) termination of the stay on enforcement would not cause severe prejudice to TANESCO; (iii) SCB HK would suffer severe prejudice if the provisional stay on enforcement remains in place; (iv) if the stay is continued, it should be made conditional upon the provision of security; (v) there is no risk of multiple recovery by SCB HK and no risk of non-recoupment from SCB HK in the event that the award is annulled; and (vi) the merits of TANESCO's application for annulment are irrelevant to the question of whether a stay should be granted. In addition, SCB HK gives a brief background to the dispute to provide context to its submissions.\n\n26.\n\nFirst, the Respondent on Annulment opposes TANESCO's assertions that, absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay on enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has *\"become almost automatic,\"* arguing that such statement is inconsistent with the provisions of the ICSID Convention (Article 52(5)), Arbitration Rules (Rule 54(4)) and established ICSID jurisprudence, which confirm that there is no presumption in favor of a continuation of the provisional stay on enforcement.11 As a result, SCB HK sustains that TANESCO has no automatic right to a continuation of the provisional stay on enforcement, and must prove that circumstances exist which require the stay to be maintained until the final decision on annulment is rendered, which in its view TANESCO has failed to do.\n\nStay Reply, paras 10-17.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that SCB HK consented to the stay in the Tanzanian courts because, with enforcement of the Award stayed provisionally pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, it was not possible for SCB HK to pursue its enforcement and conservatory measures applications in the Tanzanian courts. However, if the stay is lifted by the Committee, SCB HK will seek to lift the stay in Tanzania.12\n\nStay Reply, para 17.\n\n28.\n\nSecond, the Respondent on Annulment argues that termination of the stay on enforcement would not cause severe prejudice to TANESCO for the following reasons.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that TANESCO is seeking to rely upon its own wrongs in order to persuade the Committee to continue the stay on enforcement of the Award for the following reasons: (i) TANESCO was told repeatedly by SCB HK, and ultimately by the ICISD Tribunal which rendered the Award in relation to disputes under the PPA (the **\"PPA Tribunal\"),** that payment to anyone other than SCB HK would not discharge TANESCO's obligation to pay SCB HK under the PPA and thus could not be used to reduce the amount that TANESCO owes SCB HK; and (ii) TANESCO was aware from 2013 onwards that Pan Africa Power Solutions (T) Limited **(\"PAP\")** had usurped SCB HK's interest in IPTL. Nonetheless, it procured the release of the funds in the **\"Escrow Account\"** (into which TANESCO and the Government of Tanzania **(\"GoT\")** made payments due under the PPA) and made further payments to PAP-controlled IPTL.\n\n30.\n\nSCB HK explains that TANESCO's characterization of the harm it will suffer is confused and contradictory because TANESCO's position in its Stay Submission on whether it would be able to pay the Award, and the impact that payment of the Award would have on it, is unclear. On the one hand, TANESCO states that *\"there is no evidence that TANESCO would not have the means of paying the Award, should the Committee not annul it.\"13* On the other, TANESCO states that if the stay on enforcement is lifted: *\"TANESCO would be put under considerable financial stress, which would risk undermining its ability to fulfill its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis IPTL and its other contractual counterparties with the possible consequence that IPTL would no longer be in a position to supply electricity to TANESCO under the PPA, therefore leaving millions of Tanzanian residents without electricity.\"14*\n\nStay Reply, para 105.\n\nStay Reply, para 105.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that, in any event, the inability to pay is not a circumstance justifying a stay any more than it would justify nonpayment of any award. It further argues that *\"[t]he relevant test for hardship was set out by the Committee in* Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Republic of Guinea: *whether termination of the stay (or the granting of security) would have catastrophic, immediate and irreversible consequences for the award debtor's ability to conduct its affairs.\"15* The Respondent on Annulment argues that TANESCO has provided no evidence that payment of the Award would result in the inability of TANESCO to fulfil its obligations or affect the provision of electricity to the citizens of Tanzania.16\n\nStay Reply, para 114.\n\nStay Reply, para 114.\n\n32.\n\nThird, the Respondent on Annulment argues that SCB HK would suffer severe prejudice if the provisional stay on enforcement remains in place, as it has not received any payments of the sums due to it for the last ten years, whether pursuant to the Loan Facility Agreement or the PPA.\n\n33.\n\nSCB HK argues that not only will TANESCO seek to delay payment of the Award, there is also a substantial risk that TANESCO will not comply with the Award, causing SCB HK to suffer severe prejudice. SCB HK argues that its belief is well-founded because of TANESCO's previous actions to delay and prevent resolution of the various disputes in relation to the power plant at Tegeta, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.17\n\nStay Reply, paras 121-151.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment notes that numerous committees have held that the risk of noncompliance by an applicant on annulment with the award is a relevant circumstance in deciding whether to continue the stay on enforcement, or to order security.18\n\nStay Reply, para 152, FN145.\n\n35.\n\nIt is SCB HK\u2019s case that the risk of non-compliance by TANESCO justifies the lifting of the stay, referring to the reasoning by the committee in *01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela: \"the risk of noncompliance by the Applicant with the Award is a relevant circumstance in deciding on the Applicant's request for the continuation of the stay on enforcement.\"19*\n\nStay Reply, para 153, FN 146.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that, in the present case, there is a clear and substantial risk that TANESCO will not comply with the Award in the event that it is not annulled. This party further argues that TANESCO's conduct shows it has no regard for the ICSID process, and cannot be trusted to comply with the Award voluntarily or promptly if the Annulment Application is rejected. The Respondent on Annulment argues that TANESCO has: (i) conspired with PAP and the GoT to dissipate the Escrow Account, held at the Bank of Tanzania, which should have provided security against payment of the Award; (ii) misled the PPA Tribunal; (iii) is seeking through the Application and Stay Request to avoid its obligations to SCB HK as determined in the Award; (iv) made every effort over the last seven years to delay the resolution of this dispute; and that (v) following the Award, TANESCO sought to resist recognition and enforcement in the Tanzanian Courts, before filing the Application.20\n\nStay Reply, paras 121-151.\n\n37.\n\nFourth, the Respondent on Annulment argues that if the stay is continued, it should be made conditional upon provision of security.21 SCB HK argues that annulment committees have consistently found that if there is an objective risk that the applicant on annulment will not honor its commitments, security may be appropriate to provide assurance that they will comply with the award if it is ultimately upheld. Further, this party states that the Committee should follow the approach advocated by the committee in *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* where the key test applied was: whether there is *\"sufficient doubt\"* that the applicant on annulment will comply with the award. It is SCB HK's case that the test of *\"sufficient doubt\"* has been satisfied in the present case.22\n\nStay Reply, paras 159-167.\n\nStay Reply, paras 155-169.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that *\"asset stripping\"* has already occurred through the raiding of the Escrow Account and that TANESCO was complicit in such act. This party further explains that it is unclear from the Stay Submission whether TANESCO will be able to pay the Award. The Respondent on Annulment argues that there is in fact a clear and substantial risk that TANESCO will not comply with the Award in the event that it is not annulled and that TANESCO's actions show that it cannot be trusted to respect or comply with the Award. SCB HK's position it that, given TANESCO's previous conduct, the approach taken by the committee in *Repsol CPF Ecuador, S.A. v. Petroecnador* is appropriate: *\"the practice of requiring a bond was correct in order to prevent a party front applying for an annulment for the purposes of delaying or extending the enforcement date for the arbitral award.\"23*\n\nStay Reply, para 166, FN 153.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that if the Committee decides that the provisional stay on enforcement may be continued, it should subject it to the condition that TANESCO provides security. In arguing this point, SCB HK explains that given the way in which the previous security (the Escrow Account) was dissipated with the complicity of TANESCO, GoT, and the Bank of Tanzania, any such security should be held outside Tanzania. SCB HK requests that in such circumstances: *\"the continuation of the stay should be conditional upon the provision by TANESCO of an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond for the full amount of the Award rendered against it, inclusive of all interest accrued to the date of issuance of said irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond. The unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond should be issued by a first-tier reputable international credit institution (outside of Tanzania and with no principal establishment or branch in Tanzania) and to be immediately payable to or cashable by SCB HK upon the issuance of a decision by the Committee rejecting annulment, or if the annulment proceedings are withdrawn or discontinued.\"24*\n\nStay Reply, para 199, (ii).\n\n40.\n\nSCB HK argues that the money deposited by TANESCO and GoT in the Escrow Account should have been available as security for the amounts due to SCB HK pursuant to the PPA and that the provision of security will merely restore SCB HK to the position which should still be in place had the Escrow Account not been dissipated. SCB HK argues this point by explaining that although previous annulment committees have taken differing views in relation to the issue of betterment, the preferable view is that: (i) the granting of security in the form of a guarantee does not constitute betterment if it can be considered that the award debtor will voluntarily comply with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention to abide by and comply with the terms of the award; and (ii) the posting of a guarantee is an appropriate counterbalance to the negative effect of the stay on the award creditor, in particular where there is a risk of non-compliance with the award.\n\n41.\n\nFifth, the Respondent on Annulment argues that there is no risk of multiple recovery by SCB HK and no risk of non-recoupment from SCB HK in the event that the award is annulled, because SCB HK is not seeking to recover anything more than is due to it under the loan and it has an obligation to account to IPTL for any balance recovered above the amount due under the loan.25\n\nStay Reply, paras 177-189.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that given the PPA Tribunal's findings in the Award, exchange rate movements, and the increase in the amount outstanding under the loan due to IPTL's continued default, the amount outstanding under the loan is now over US$168 million, and the Award is only for US$148 million (plus interest). As such, it argues that now the Award will not discharge the loan in full and that SCB HK will only recover the loan if: (i) the Award is paid in full by TANESCO; and (ii) further sums are recovered under other proceedings.26\n\nStay Reply, paras 177-184.\n\n43.\n\nSCB HK argues that its claim in the English High Court pursuant to the loan was brought not in an attempt to recover more than SCB HK is entitled to under the loan, but to counter the arguments made in Tanzania for a number of years concerning the validity of the assignment of the loan. Moreover, it argues that it is not clear whether SCB HK will be able to enforce the Flaux J Judgment against IPTL, as the \"PAC Report\" (a report by the Tanzanian Public Accounts Committee on 17 November 2014) confirms that once the US$120 million contained in the Escrow Account was paid to PAP, some US$75 million was paid to VIP Engineering & Marketing Limited, IPTL's minority shareholder, following which it *\"started to be distributed to private individuals\"* and that\n\n*\"[a]mong the money paid to individuals, there are the names of political leaders, religious leaders, judges and other government officials.\"27*\n\nStay Reply, para 183.\n\n44.\n\nFurther, SCB HK argues, with respect to the Implementation Agreement claim, that it is claiming damages for GoT's actions with respect to the release of the Escrow Account funds, among other things, and that if it recovers in excess of the amount of its loan, it will account for the balance as appropriate.\n\n45.\n\nFinally, the Respondent on Annulment argues that there is no risk of nonrecoupment from SCB HK in the event that the Award is annulled. It explains that SCB HK is a bank with substantial assets, and with profit in the year ended 31 December 2016 of HK$7,929 million (approx. US$1 billion). It further notes that it is also a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank, a global financial institution with offices and branches all over the world, including in Tanzania. It further argues that annulment committees have previously held that, in the case of large multinational claimant companies, the risk of non-recoupment of an award is not a relevant factor, referring to *CDC Group Pic v. Republic of the Seychelles.28*\n\nStay Reply, para 188.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent on Annulment argues that annulment committees have recognized that the *prima facie* grounds for annulment are not relevant to whether an applicant on annulment is entitled to a stay.29\n\nStay Reply, para 192: *\"As noted by the committee in* Sempra Energy International v Argentine Republic *(citing the passages relied upon by TANESCO in* MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v The Republic of Chile *and* CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic): *'Previous ad hoc committees have consistently rejected the proposition that a preliminary assessment of the prospects of the application for annulment should be a factor influencing the Committee's decision whether a stay should be granted or not.*\n\n**III.** The Committee's Analysis\n---------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn light of the Parties' positions set out above, there are three main issues to be addressed by the Committee. First, whether the stay on the enforcement of the Award should be maintained pending a decision on the Application **(Section III.l).** Second, if the Committee decides to maintain the stay on the enforcement of the Award, whether the ordering of such stay should be made subject to conditions **(Section III.2).** Third, if the Committee decides to impose conditions on the granting of the stay, what are the conditions that it should impose on the granting of the stay **(Section III.3).**\n\n**III.1** The Granting of the Stay on Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe first issue to be considered is whether the stay on enforcement of the Award should be maintained pending a decision on the Application. First, the Committee will address the legal standard for the continuation of the stay **(III.l.l)** and then comment on the factors relevant for issuing this decision of the stay on enforcement of the Award **(III.1.2).**\n\n**III.1.1** Legal Standard for the Continuation of the Stay\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nICSID Convention Article 52(5) stipulates that: *\"The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay on enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"30*\n\nICSID Convention, April 2006, Article 52(5), pp. 26-27\n\n50.\n\nThe use of the phrase: *\"if it [the committee] considers that the circumstances so require,\"* rather than the formulation *\"so permit,\"* indicates the necessity for the committee to positively establish circumstances prone to justify the requested stay on enforcement. The use of the word *\"may\"* indicates that it is a matter within the discretion of the committee whether or not to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision on an application for annulment.\n\n51.\n\nAlthough not bound by prior decisions in other ICSID cases, the Committee has taken note of, and given consideration to, the existing cases on the grant of stays under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention referred to by both sides in their submissions, as well as to the arguments and legal authorities referred to during the First Session. The Committee considers that in the present case, it is not necessary to deal extensively with the reasoning of prior decisions on requests to stay the enforcement of awards. Each decision has been based on a different set of factual circumstances from the ones at issue, and consideration of whether to grant a stay must be dependent upon the particular circumstances of the present case.\n\n52.\n\nIn consideration of the previous, it is the view of the Committee that it is empowered to exercise its discretion as to whether or not to continue the stay on the enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the Application.31\n\nSee further *01 European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25 -Annulment proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 4 April 2016, **LE-2.**\n\n53.\n\nArticle 52(5) does not indicate that one particular party bears the burden of establishing circumstances requiring a stay. It rather seems that establishing the existence of such circumstances is part of the Committee's discretionary power, and that Article 54(4) of the Arbitration Rules require the applicant to specify the circumstances requiring the stay.\n\n54.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee from an interpretation of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, it is for the award debtor to advance grounds (supported as necessary by evidence) for the stay. If the award creditor disputes these grounds, it must also advance evidence in support of any *\"positive allegations\"* that it makes. As clearly expressed in *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey. \"The exercise of the discretion of the Committee depends on the circumstances surrounding the Stay Request... and the Committee considers that its decision should be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances.\"32*\n\nStay Reply, FN 8: ***\"LE-1,*** Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v Republic of Turkey, *ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant's Request for Continued Stay on Enforcement of the Award, 7 May 2012, at [43]**, footnote referencing* Pey Casado v Republic of Chile *omitted.\"*\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the above, the Committee must establish the existence of circumstances sufficient to justify the stay, taking into consideration the allegations submitted by the Parties. The Committee's discretion is to be exercised in consideration of the circumstances of the present case - a specific, fact-driven decision.\n\n56.\n\nCommittees have taken into account several factors when assessing whether to grant a stay on enforcement depending on all relevant circumstances, including the risk of non-recovery of sums due under the award if the award is annulled, non-compliance with the award if the award is not annulled, adverse economic consequences on either party and the balance of both parties' interests, among others.33\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, up to 5 May 2016.\n\n**III.1.2.** Factors Relevant for this Decision on the Granting of a Stay on Enforcement\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe following is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of all the circumstances that may be deemed of relevance by committees to rule upon requests for stay on enforcement. Rather, in line with the facts-based approach provided in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, it aims at addressing some relevant and duly established factors raised by the Parties in the case at hand.\n\n58.\n\nIn deciding on whether to maintain or terminate the stay on enforcement, the Committee will take into consideration the adverse economic consequences on either party and the balance of the Parties' interests should the stay be granted or lifted. The Parties have pleaded the following factors:\n\na. strength of the case for or against annulment;\n\nb. risk of non-compliance with the Award and prospect of enforcement if the Award is upheld; and\n\nc. possible irreparable injury to the award debtor in the case of immediate enforcement: (i) hardship if the stay is lifted; and (ii) problems with recovering payment if the award is later annulled.\n\n**(A)** Strength of the Case for or against Annulment\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the existence of serious grounds for annulment also clearly supports the maintenance of the stay and that other committees have established that a request for continuation of a stay can be denied only if it is obvious that the application is *\"without any basis under the Convention\"* and is purely *\"dilatory\"* in nature, which is not the case in these proceedings.34\n\nStay Submission, para 28.\n\n60.\n\nThe Committee does not consider appropriate at this time to evaluate whether there is a strong case for or against annulment in deciding on the Stay Request. The Committee is guided by the reasoning expressed by annulment committees, which have recognized that the *prima facie* grounds for annulment are not relevant to whether an applicant on annulment is entitled to a stay.35\n\nStay Reply, para 190-196: *\"As noted by the committee in* Sempra Energy International v Argentine Republic *(citing the passages relied upon by TANESCO in* MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v The Republic of Chile *and* CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic): *'Previous ad hoc committees have consistently rejected the proposition that a preliminary assessment of the prospects of the**application for annulment should be a factor influencing the Committee's decision whether a stay should be granted or not.'\"*\n\n61.\n\nTANESCO has exercised its right to apply for annulment contemplated under the ICSID Convention, and as such it has a legitimate right to request that the stay is continued, until the final decision is rendered by the Committee. There is no reason to consider that in this particular case the institution of the annulment proceedings was purely dilatory in nature.\n\n**(B)** Risk of Non-Compliance with the Award and Prospect of Enforcement if the Award is Upheld\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe approach advocated by the committees in *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* and *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* and *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P v. Argentine Republic* is followed by the Committee in the present case. The key test is whether there is sufficient doubt that the applicant on annulment will comply with the award, if upheld.36\n\nStay Reply, paras 160-162.\n\n63.\n\nIt is SCB HK's case that the test of *\"sufficient doubt\"* has been satisfied in the present case. The Committee hereby will consider whether this test is met.\n\n64.\n\nFirst, the Committee gives weight to the fact that in its Stay Submission, TANESCO's position on whether it would be able to pay the Award is unclear. On the one hand, TANESCO states that *\"there is no evidence that TANESCO would not have the means of paying the Award, should the Committee not annul it.\"37* On the other, TANESCO states that if the stay on enforcement is lifted: *\"TANESCO would be put under considerable financial stress, which would risk undermining its ability to fulfill its obligations vis-\u00e0-vis IPTL and its other contractual counterparties with the possible consequence that IPTL would no longer be in a position**to supply electricity to TANESCO under the PPA, therefore leaving millions of Tanzanian residents without electricity.\"38*\n\nStay Submission, para 12.\n\nStay Submission, para 18.\n\n65.\n\nIf TANESCO's position is that payment of the Award would put it under considerable financial stress which would risk undermining its ability to pay its contractual counterparties, then there must be a risk that TANESCO will be unable to pay the Award - particularly if payment is further delayed and the amount due increases as interest continues to accrue.\n\n66.\n\nFurther, TANESCO has indicated that should *\"the Capacity Payment\"* (payable pursuant to clause 5.1(a) of the PPA) be paid into court, as requested by SCB HK in local enforcement proceedings, the same could not be paid to IPTL, which is currently performing its obligations under the PPA. The former would jeopardize the supply of electricity by IPTL.39\n\nStay Submission, para 13.\n\n67.\n\nFrom the above assertions, the Committee considers that in the present case, there is a substantial risk that TANESCO will not comply with the Award in the event that it is not annulled. Additionally, the Committee notes that in the present Application, there are serious allegations made by SCB HK that TANESCO has conspired with PAP and the GoT to dissipate the Escrow Account, held at the Bank of Tanzania, which should have provided security against payment of the Award and that TANESCO has misled the PPA Tribunal,40 which if confirmed, would raise the risk of non-enforcement of the Award.\n\nStay Reply, paras 121-151.\n\n68.\n\nAlso, the conduct of TANESCO, following the issuance of the Award, gives an indication as to its possible reluctance to comply. TANESCO sought to resist recognition and enforcement in the Tanzanian Courts before filing the Application, arguing that *\"the amount involved is colossal\"* and that complying with the Award would *\"affect the operations of the applicant while pending the determination of the intended application for stay of execution before the ICSID Tribunal and intended application for annulment are heard and determined.\"41*\n\nStay Reply, para 134, FN 135, Exhibit-051 Miscellaneous Civil Application No. 686 of 2016, Affidavit of Isdor Paul Nkrndi, para 10.\n\n**(C)** Risk of Possible Irreparable Injury to the Award Debtor in the Case of Immediate Enforcement\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Hardship if the stay is lifted*\n------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Committee is guided by the following test for hardship set out by the committee in *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Republic of Guinea:* whether termination of the stay (or the granting of security) would have catastrophic, immediate and irreversible consequences for the award debtor's ability to conduct its affairs.42\n\nStay Reply, para 114, FN 118. *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3 - Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 October 2008, Annex-28 ***(('Enron v. Argentina\").***\n\n70.\n\nIt is likely that if the stay is lifted, SCB HK will pursue the enforcement proceedings of the Award which it has already commenced before the High Court of Tanzania and possibly in other jurisdictions.43 Although enforcement proceedings in Tanzania have been stayed as recently as 27 February 2017 by consent of all parties to those proceedings (including SCB HK) pending determination of the Application before the Committee, SCB HK has expressed that it would request that such stay be lifted if there is no stay granted in the current annulment proceeding.44\n\nStay Submission, para 10.\n\nStay Reply, para 17.\n\n71.\n\nThus, TANESCO could still be forced to litigate enforcement proceedings in Tanzania while the Application is pending.45\n\nStay Submission, para 13.\n\n72.\n\nA lift of the stay would not entail unjustified multiple recovery for SCB HK. SCB HK has stated that it is not seeking to recover anything more than is due to it under the loan and that it has an obligation to account to IPTL for any balance recovered above the amount due under the loan.46\n\nStay Reply, paras 177-189.\n\n*(ii) Problems with recovering payment if the Award is later annulled*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Committee considers that in the present case, the risk of non-recoupment of the Award is not a relevant factor given that a company is involved, as noted by the committee in *CDC Group Plc v. Republic of the Seychelles.47* In the present case, SCB HK is a bank with substantial assets, and which has stated it had a profit in the year ended 31 December 2016 of HK$7,929 million (approx. US$1 billion). It is also a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Bank, a global financial institution with offices and branches all over the world, including in Tanzania. Thus, there are no elements on record to sustain the risk of non-recoupment. The press record submitted by TANESCO during the First Session does not prove otherwise.48\n\nStay Reply, para 188.\n\nTANESCO's Hearing Bundle, Tab. 14.\n\n**III.2** Imposing Conditions on the Granting of the Stay on the Enforcement of the Award\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe second issue to be considered is whether conditions should be imposed on the granting of the stay. The Parties disagree on whether the Committee has the discretionary power to condition the stay.\n\n75.\n\nAs a starting point, the Committee notes that the terms of the ICSID Convention are the source of the Committee's power to modify or grant a stay. The question whether the Committee can make a stay conditional on the provision of security is a matter of interpretation of the ICSID Convention. In conducting such interpretation, the Committee is guided by Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\").\n\n76.\n\nIn line with the interpretation carried out in *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P v. Argentine Republic,49* under Article 31.1 of the VCLT, the Committee notes that the ICSID Convention is silent on the question whether or not an *ad hoc* committee can make a stay conditional on the provision of security. The Committee does not view that silence as meaning that the power does not exist. That discretionary power to allow or deny such remedy may implicitly include a power to allow the remedy subject to conditions. This interpretation is consistent with the object and purpose of Article 52(5), which is designed to enable the *ad hoc* committee to balance the rights of the parties pending annulment proceedings.\n\n*Enron v. Argentina,* Annex-28.\n\n77.\n\nAccording to Article 31.3(b) of the VCLT, *\"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\"* shall also be considered. The Committee has not been made aware that an ICSID Contracting State has expressed concern in any forum that the decisions issued by a committee conditioning the stay exceeds the *ad hoc* committee's power under Article 52(5).\n\n78.\n\nAs for Article 32 of VCLT, the Committee also turns to supplementary means of interpretation in order to confirm the meaning of Article 52(5).\n\n79.\n\nFirst, regarding the preparatory work of the ICSID Convention, TANESCO argues that the Preliminary Draft of the ICSID Convention provided for *ad hoc* committees to have a power to recommend any provisional measures necessary for the protection of the rights of the parties in connection with a stay of enforcement, but that power did not appear in later drafts of the ICSID Convention.50 The Committee finds that it is not clear why the power to recommend provisional measures was omitted nor why the ICSID Convention differs from the New York Convention in this regard. The Committee notes that Arbitration Rule 53 appears to be broad enough to confer on an *ad hoc* committee the power to recommend provisional measures contained in Arbitration Rule 39.\n\nTranscript, 30 March 2017, pp. 140-141.\n\n80.\n\nIn view of this, Article 52(5) must be given a broader, rather than a narrower, interpretation since the *ad hoc* committee has the power to balance the rights of the parties pending the annulment proceeding.\n\n81.\n\nSecond, as regards previous ICSID decisions: *\"There have been a total of 43 requests for a stay of enforcement in the 90 registered annulments, 41 of which have led to Committee decisions. Thirty-six decisions granted the stay of enforcement. In 22 of those instances where a stay was granted it was conditioned upon the issuance of some type of security or written undertaking. In 11 of those 22 cases, the stay was terminated because the condition had not been satisfied.\"51*\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, up to 5 May 2016.\n\n82.\n\nThe Committee considers that although not bound by these decisions, weight must be given to the fact that a sizeable group of committees have ordered stays conditional on the provision of security.\n\n83.\n\nAs regards to doctrine, the Committee has not been referred to any doctrine expressing the view that there is no power under Article 52(5) to make a stay conditional on security. On the contrary, the Committee has been referred to doctrine affirming the existence of this power.52\n\nHearing Bundle, Exhibit 17, Christoph H. Schreuer *et al.,* The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Second Edition, p. 1081.\n\n84.\n\nFurther, the obligation that each State assumed on ratification of the Convention, under Article 53, to comply with awards against it is particularly important. This obligation is as important as the right to pursue annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. These two articles are linked together.\n\n85.\n\nHaving regard to all these matters, the Committee finds that, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, it may make the continuation of the stay on enforcement conditional.\n\n86.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee considers it necessary to grant the stay on enforcement of the Award, given that there is a possible risk that prior to the decision on annulment, TANESCO may suffer considerable financial stress, which could risk undermining its ability to continue fulfilling its obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* IPTL and its other contractual counterparties with the possible consequence that IPTL would no longer be in a position to supply electricity to TANESCO under the PPA, leaving millions of Tanzanian residents without electricity. Notwithstanding the former, these assertions have also led the Committee to decide to condition such a stay. Given TANESCO's own assertions that it would be in considerable financial stress should the Award be enforced, this raises a valid concern on the part of SCB HK that there is uncertainty as to TANESCO's ability and willingness to fulfill the Award. By conditioning the stay, Claimant's right of enforcement shall also be protected, in order to balance the interest of the Parties.\n\n87.\n\nThe Committee rejects the argument that security constitutes betterment.53 The lifting of the provisional stay or imposition of a guarantee are not punishments: the parties have a procedural right guaranteed by the ICSID Convention that allows them to request the annulment of an award, but this right cannot operate against the presumption of validity of awards rendered under the ICSID Convention. Therefore, the Committee is convinced that the stay on enforcement shall be conditioned as detailed below.\n\nTranscript, 30 March 2017, p.166. See further Stay Reply, para 172: \". *...in* Sempra Energy International v Argentine Republic: *'the Committee considers that the appropriate comparison is not with a scenario where the award debtor would not comply with its obligation under Article 53 (where a guarantee would obviously be ''better\"), but with one where the debtor would comply. In such case the guarantee would not place the award creditor in a better situation...Although not relevant for the comparison, if there is a risk that the award debtor -whether a State party or a foreign investor - would not comply with its obligation under Article 53, the safeguard inherent in provision of a guarantee would be filly warranted.\"\u2019*\n\n**III.3.** Conditions to be Imposed on the Granting of the Stay on the Enforcement of the Award\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn light of the facts, the Committee decides that: The provisional stay on enforcement of the Award is extended until such time as the Committee determines, on the condition that TANESCO provides, within 30 days of the decision of the Committee, an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond issued by a first-tier reputable international credit institution (outside of Tanzania and with no principal establishment branch in Tanzania) for the full amount of the Award rendered against TANESCO, inclusive of all interest accrued to the date of issuance of said irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond, and immediately payable to or cashable by SCB HK upon the issuance of a final decision of the Committee rejecting the annulment, or if the annulment proceedings are withdrawn or discontinued. In the event that TANESCO declines to issue such guarantee and informs the Secretary-General of ICSID within 30 calendar days following the notification of this Decision, the stay on enforcement shall be automatically terminated. In the case that the Committee annuls the Award, the bank guarantee or security bond granted will be released.\n\n**IV.** Decision\n----------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Committee decides to continue the stay on enforcement of the Award pending a decision on the Application and subject to the conditions set out above in numeral III. 3.\n\n90.\n\nIf the conditions set out above are not complied with, the stay on enforcement shall be automatically terminated."}]}
