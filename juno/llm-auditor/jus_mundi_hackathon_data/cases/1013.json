PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 1, 2017, Raiffeisen Bank International AG and Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d. (\"Claimants\") submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") against the Republic of Croatia (\"Croatia\" or \"Respondent\").\n\n2.\n\nOn September 15, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"ICSID Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Professor Lucy Reed, a national of the United States of America, President, appointed by the agreement of the Parties; Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of the Republic of Bulgaria, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. Lazar Tomov, a national of the Republic of Bulgaria, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n4.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). Mr. Alex B. Kaplan, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the \"Proposal\"). On that date, the Centre informed the parties that the proceeding will be suspended until the Proposal is decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n6.\n\nThe Parties were also informed that the Proposal will be decided by the other Members of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4).\n\n7.\n\nA procedural calendar was established for the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Proposal. In compliance with that procedural calendar, the Claimants submitted their Response on the Claimant\u2019s proposal to disqualify Dr. Alexandrov on March 8, 2018 (the \"Response\").\n\n8.\n\nOn March 12, 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that Dr. Alexandrov will not be submitting observations on the Parties\u2019 submissions to date related to the Respondent\u2019s Proposal and that, in accordance with the procedural calendar established for the Proposal, the Parties may file any further observations related to the Proposal.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, the Respondent filed Further Observations to the Claimants\u2019 Response of March 8, 2018 (the \"Further Observations\"), and the Claimants sent email correspondence to the Secretariat indicating that they have no further observations on the Proposal.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of April 6, 2018, Mr. Lazar Tomov informed the Centre that, for reasons explained in his letter, he could not decide the Proposal, recusing himself. A copy of Mr. Tomov\u2019s letter was transmitted to the Parties on that same date indicating that the proposal would be decided by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (the \"Chairman\"). No comments were received from the Parties on this issue.\n\n**II. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Proposal**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Relevant Legal Standard**\n-----------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention regulate the disqualification of arbitrators in ICSID proceedings. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention establishes the right of a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal on the basis of \"any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by\" Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, which states that a tribunal member must possess high moral character and have recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, has been widely interpreted as encompassing the requirement that members of tribunals need to be both independent and impartial.1\n\nProposal para. 16.\n\n12.\n\nRespondent has interpreted ICSID jurisprudence in the following way. \"Impartiality refers to the absence of bias or a predisposition towards one party\" and \"independence relates to the absence of external control, in particular of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator\u2019s decision.\" In this regard, independence and impartiality \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case.\"2\n\nProposal para. 17.\n\n13.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that the applicable legal standard for disqualification in ICSID proceedings is \"an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of evidence by a third party.\" The term \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious\" in that it \"relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of [independence and impartiality] can be perceived.\"3\n\nProposal para. 18.\n\n14.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent states that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention requires that an arbitrator be disqualified where a reasonably informed third party would conclude that there are justifiable doubts (not certainties or even likelihoods, but doubts) about the challenged tribunal member\u2019s ability to exercise independent and impartial judgment or that there is an appearance (not certainty or even likelihood but appearance) of dependency or bias arising from the circumstances of a given case.4\n\nProposal para. 19.\n\n15.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent notes that numerous ICSID tribunals have referred to the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (\"IBA Guidelines\"). The IBA Guidelines are regarded as \"instructive\" and \"useful references.\"5\n\nProposal paras. 20-22.\n\n**(2) Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s Repeat Appointments in Cases against Croatia Establish an Absence of Impartiality and Independence**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Dr. Alexandrov has served as claimant\u2019s appointee in 35 cases out of the total 38 known investment treaty arbitrations in which he has sat as an arbitrator. He was the president of the tribunal in two cases, both of which were decided in favor of the claimants, and he was appointed once by a respondent more than a decade ago.6\n\nProposal paras. 35, 48.\n\n17.\n\nOther claimants (and not the Claimants in this case) have appointed Dr. Alexandrov in four ongoing investment treaty arbitrations against Croatia in addition to this proceeding. They are:\n\n\u2022 *Georg Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/39) *(\"Gavrilovi\u0107\");*\n\n*\u2022 B3 Croatian Courier Cooperatief U.A. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/5);\n\n\u2022 *Amlyn Holding B.V. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/28); and\n\n\u2022 *Addiko Bank AG and Addiko Bank d.d. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No ARB/17/37) (\"*Addiko*\" or \"*Addiko v. Croatia*\").7\n\nProposal para. 27.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent indicated that Dr. Alexandrov declined to accept the appointment in *Addiko*. In doing so, he included a message to be transmitted to the Parties via ICSID that expressly disavowed the concerns raised by the Respondent related to multiple appointments against Croatia prior to ICSID seeking his appointment in that case. Thus, in the Respondent\u2019s view, even though Dr. Alexandrov declined the appointment, he indicated his willingness to sit as an arbitrator in future ICSID cases against Croatia.8\n\nProposal para. 28.\n\n19.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Croatia has faced ten ICSID arbitrations to date, nine of which are pending. Dr. Alexandrov has been nominated by the claimants in half of these cases, and he is presently acting as the claimant-appointed arbitrator in 45 percent of the ongoing ICSID claims. As a result, the Respondent contends that Dr. Alexandrov possesses significant and unique influence over the Respondent\u2019s financial situation and international reputation which no single arbitrator should possess. Further, the Respondent argues that where an arbitrator is repeatedly appointed by claimants in cases against the same respondent, the arbitrator is highly likely to be negatively predisposed against that respondent\u2019s arguments or incentivized to be so predisposed - even subconsciously - in order to secure further appointments by claimants.9\n\nProposal paras. 30-32.\n\n20.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s repeat appointments in cases against Croatia is concerning in light of his changed professional circumstances. Dr. Alexandrov left the partnership of Sidley Austin LLP to become an independent arbitrator in September 2017. As a result, in the Respondent\u2019s view, Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s income is dependent on his own revenue generation and the main source of that revenue is arbitral appointments by claimants in investment treaty arbitrations.10\n\nProposal para. 35.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent states that repeat appointments, such as the ones described above, \"lead to the conclusion that it is manifest that the arbitrator cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment as required by the Convention.\" The criteria for deciding whether repeat appointments pose a threat to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality and independence are qualitative rather than quantitative. In essence, the assessment of the risk underlying repeat appointments does not translate into a mere computation of how many such appointments have taken place over a specified number of years.Rather, it entails a much broader analysis of the overall circumstances of a challenged arbitrator\u2019s profile.11\n\nProposal para. 47.\n\n22.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent believes that the problem with repeat appointments rests in the fact that \"the prospect of continued and regular appointment, with the attendant financial benefits, might create a relationship of dependence or otherwise influence the arbitrator\u2019s judgment.\" The risk is particularly heightened where repeat appointments represent a major source of the arbitrator\u2019s income, thus implying financial dependence, as is the case with Dr. Alexandrov.12\n\nProposal para. 48.\n\n23.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent asserts that serial appointments of the same arbitrator by different claimants in cases against the same respondent party can be likened to multiple appointments of an arbitrator by a claimant or its counsel under Section 3.1.3 of the IBA Guidelines. Section 3.1.3 provides that an arbitrator falls within the Orange List if he or she has \"within the past three years, been appointed as arbitrator on two or more occasions by one of the parties.\"13\n\nProposal para. 49.\n\n24.\n\nThus, the Respondent concludes that Dr. Alexandrov is, put simply, already perceived as a professional anti-Croatia claimant arbitrator.14\n\nProposal para. 49.\n\n**(3) Consideration of the Same Legal Issue in Multiple Arbitrations Establish an Absence of Impartiality and Independence**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent states that one of the disputes in which Dr. Alexandrov is sitting, *Gavrilovi\u0107,* is similar to the present proceeding in that it is also based on the Austria-Croatia BIT. Although that arbitration is significantly more advanced than the present proceeding, it is likely that arguments relating to the compatibility of Austria-Croatia BIT with the law of the European Union will be central to both the present arbitration and the *Gavrilovi\u0107* proceeding.15\n\nProposal para. 51.\n\n26.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, this means that when the issue is put before the Tribunal in the present case, Dr. Alexandrov will already have been privy to third party and tribunal members\u2019 views. Further, he will already have formed his own views and taken decisions on the issue in *Gavrilovi\u0107* before having the opportunity to hear the Parties\u2019 views in the instant case.16\n\nProposal para. 34.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, participation in related or similar investment treaty arbitrations \"is an important consideration in the assessment of [an arbitrator's] perceived impartiality\" since the arbitrator will likely have \"obtained documents or information in one arbitration that are relevant to the dispute to be determined in another arbitration.\" As a result, Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s \"objectivity and open-mindedness with regard to the facts and issues to be decided in the present arbitration are tainted.\"17\n\nProposal para. 51.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that this problem is highlighted in Section 3.1.5 of the IBA Guidelines. Specifically, Section 3.1.5 provides that an arbitrator falls in the Orange list if he or she \"currently serves, or has served within the past three years, as arbitrator in an arbitration on a related issue involving one of the parties or an affiliate of the parties.\"18\n\nProposal para. 51.\n\n**(4) Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s History of Appointments with Claimants\u2019 Counsel Establish an Absence of Impartiality and Independence**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Dr. Alexandrov and the Claimants\u2019 counsel, WilmerHale, have developed a special relationship as the record of appointments between them is extensive.19 The Respondent uses the term \"cross-appointments\" to refer to appointments of Dr. Alexandrov as arbitrator by WilmerHale and appointments of Mr. Gary Born, a partner at WilmerHale, as arbitrator, by Dr. Alexandrov, as counsel.\n\nProposal para. 38.\n\n30.\n\nIn addition to WilmerHale\u2019s appointment of Dr. Alexandrov in the instant case, the crossappointments at issue are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Dr. Alexandrov is co-counsel with Sidley Austin LLP in a commercial case where Mr. Gary Born, partner at WilmerHale and counsel to the Claimants, serves as the arbitrator appointed by Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s client.\n\n\u2022 Dr. Alexandrov was appointed by WilmerHale as the claimant\u2019s co-arbitrator in *J&P-AVAX S.A. v. Lebanese Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/29).\n\n\u2022 Mr. Gary Born was appointed as an arbitrator in *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e1rl (Switzerland), Philip Morris Products S.A. (Switzerland) and Abal Hermanos S.A. (Uruguay) v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7). Though the respondent prevailed in that case, Mr. Born issued a dissenting opinion in favor of the claimants.\n\n\u2022 WilmerHale nominated Dr. Alexandrov as the claimant\u2019s arbitrator in *Addiko*.\n\n\u2022 WilmerHale appointed Dr. Alexandrov as the claimant\u2019s arbitrator in an investment treaty arbitration *GRAND EXPRESS Non-Public Joint Stock Company v. Republic of Belarus* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/18/1) (\"*Grand Express*\"). Dr. Alexandrov did not disclose the appointment in this case.20\n\nProposal paras. 39-40.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent states that these cross-appointments clearly point to an ongoing and consistent professional relationship between Dr. Alexandrov and counsel for the Claimants in this case that is inappropriate. As a result of this ongoing relationship, Dr. Alexandrov will be motivated - consciously or unconsciously - to prejudge the present case in a manner favorable to the Claimants and WilmerHale. Such doubts give rise to an appearance of dependence or bias.21\n\nProposal para. 41.\n\n**(5) Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s Relationship with The Brattle Group Establish an Absence of Impartiality and Independence**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent believes that Dr. Alexandrov also lacks impartial judgment against the Respondent because The Brattle Group, a firm of financial consultants, is involved in at least one of the current investment treaty cases against the Respondent arising out of its financial sector. The claimants in *UniCredit Bank Austria AG and Zagrebacka Banka d.d. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/31) (\"*UniCredit*\" or \"*Unicredit v. Croatia*\"), an arbitration also brought under the Austria-Croatia BIT and relating to the same facts as the present case, have retained The Brattle Group as experts according to information in the public domain.22\n\nProposal para. 42.\n\n33.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Dr. Alexandrov has a long-standing and publicly-recognized relationship with The Brattle Group, as he has retained their services to deliver expert testimony in multiple treaty arbitrations while working as a partner at Sidley Austin LLP.23\n\nProposal para. 43.\n\n34.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent argues that Dr. Alexandrov will be predisposed toward arguments and evidence put forward by the Claimants, knowing that The Brattle Group has recently given expert evidence on behalf of claimants in respect of an arbitration under the same BIT with an identical factual basis.24\n\nProposal para. 43.\n\n35.\n\nFurther, the Respondent notes it is not the first party to an investment arbitration to comment on the impropriety of Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s long-standing relationship with The Brattle Group. His independence and impartiality were also questioned in three prior cases on the basis of his relationship with The Brattle Group. They are:\n\n\u2022 *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38), in which Dr. Alexandrov resigned. According to the Respondent, this resignation is a clear indication of the legitimacy of its concerns about Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s ongoing use of The Brattle Group in two cases in which he acted as counsel and his 15-year relationship with The Brattle Group;\n\n\u2022 *Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB 12/1) in which the respondent twice proposed Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s disqualification due to the claimant\u2019s engagement of The Brattle Group; and\n\n\u2022 *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e1.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36), in which Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s failure to disclose his relationship with The Brattle Group is raised as a ground for annulment of that award.25\n\nProposal para. 44.\n\n36.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent argues that viewed together and independently, the facts set out above demonstrate that the Respondent has met the legal standard for the disqualification of Dr. Alexandrov in this case.26\n\nProposal para. 53.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Response**\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) Respondent Has Artificially Lowered the Relevant Standard**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention requires both independence and impartiality. The Claimants also agree that the standard for disqualification under Article 57 is \"an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of evidence by a third party.\" However, the Respondent has failed to properly appreciate the import of the requirement that any lack of independence or impartiality be \"manifest.\" The Respondent\u2019s own legal authorities make clear that the correct standard is significantly higher. Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s position, mere doubts or an appearance of bias are insufficient to satisfy the test under Article 57 of a \"*manifest*\" lack of independence.27\n\nResponse paras. 3-5.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the decision in *OPIC*, an authority also relied on by the Respondent, wherein the unchallenged arbitrators cautioned that there\n\n*exists a relatively high burden for those seeking to challenge ICSID arbitrators. The Convention\u2019s requirement that the lack of independence be \"manifest\" necessitates that this lack be clearly and objectively established. Accordingly, it is not sufficient to show an appearance of a lack of impartiality and independence.*28\n\nResponse para. 6 (citing *OPIC Karimum Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/14), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Professor Philippe Sands (May 5, 2011), at para. 45) (\"*OPIC*\").\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants state that respected commentators have equally underlined the heavy burden a party must satisfy to disqualify an arbitrator under Article 57. As such, to succeed on its challenge, the Respondent must establish facts that make it \"obvious and highly probable\" that Dr. Alexandrov cannot be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment in this case. Although the Claimants agree that sources such as the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration may be useful as part of this analysis, they cannot change the underlying legal standard required by the ICSID Convention.29\n\nResponse para. 8.\n\n**(2) The Multiple Appointments at Issue Do Not Establish an Absence of Impartiality or Independence**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a The Proposal\u2019s Factual Premise of an Unduly Claimant-Friendly Arbitrator Is Flawed***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent attempts to imply a lack of impartiality and independence by noting, *inter alia*, the number of cases in which Dr. Alexandrov has been appointed by Claimants. Yet the Respondent asserts elsewhere in its Proposal that \"[t]he criteria for deciding whether repeat appointments pose a threat to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality and independence are qualitative rather than quantitative.\" As such, the Respondent\u2019s reference to a number of appointments by other claimants is the sort of speculation tribunals have routinely rejected in the context of challenges.30\n\nResponse para. 12.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it is a fact of the investment arbitration system that some arbitrators accept more appointments from claimants, others from respondent States, and yet others as presiding arbitrator. This is reflected in the Respondent\u2019s own appointment practice. The Respondent has appointed Professor Brigitte Stern in several of its pending ICSID cases. According to her ICSID CV, Professor Stern has sat as a respondent\u2019s coarbitrator 55 times, presiding or sole arbitrator only three times, and as a claimant\u2019s coarbitrator just once - in a case filed in 2004. Christopher Thomas (also appointed by Croatia) has never sat in an ICSID arbitration other than as a respondent\u2019s co-arbitrator, which he has done 18 times. The Respondent had no hesitation to appoint these eminent arbitrators in several cases, which reveals its present complaint is frivolous.31\n\nResponse para. 14.\n\n42.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants assert that the Respondent seeks to infer that Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s recent decision to become a sole practitioner demonstrates an inappropriate disposition towards investors. The Respondent asserts that Dr. Alexandrov \"is now entirely and directly financially dependent on his own revenue generation and... the main source of his income derives from sitting as claimant-appointed co-arbitrator in investment treaty arbitrations.\"32\n\nResponse para. 15.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants reply that the Respondent has failed to identify any particular respect in which Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s impartiality or independence in this case would be affected by virtue of the fact that he now works solely as an arbitrator in a multitude of entirely unrelated matters. Indeed, in addition to this case, Dr. Alexandrov is currently sitting as arbitrator in 20 pending ICSID cases, having been appointed by various counsel against a variety of respondents, not including arbitrations under other arbitral rules. If anything, this compels the opposite inference: because Dr. Alexandrov has been appointed in a wide range of matters involving a multitude of parties and sectors, he is not dependent on any single case or matter. This only underscores his ability to exercise free and independent judgment.33\n\nResponse para. 16.\n\n***b. The Factual Premise of an \"Anti-Croatia\" Arbitrator Is Equally Flawed***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Dr. Alexandrov has been appointed in four arbitrations involving Croatia and asserts that \"a reasonably informed third party would conclude\" that Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s appointment in four arbitrations against Croatia would appear to be \"more than random coincidence.\"34\n\nResponse para. 17.\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants agree that Dr. Alexandrov is currently sitting in three other ongoing investment arbitrations against Croatia (in addition to the present case). But in the Claimants\u2019 view, the other three cases have nothing to do with the present arbitration, or with each other: the factual basis for each claim is different. Indeed, the claimants in all four cases are different, and they are all represented by different counsel. In reality, Dr. Alexandrov appears to have been independently appointed by different parties and their lawyers in cases that happen to involve Croatia as a respondent. This is not surprising given Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s unique background as a renowned investment law specialist with personal roots in the CEE region. Thus, Dr. Alexandrov also sits, or has recently sat, in cases involving Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Serbia.35\n\nResponse para. 18.\n\n46.\n\nIn the absence of any real factual concern, the Respondent speculates that \"[w]here an arbitrator is repeatedly appointed by claimants against the same respondent, that arbitrator is highly likely to be negatively predisposed against that respondent\u2019s arguments or incentivized to be so predisposed - even subconsciously - in order to secure further appointments by claimants.\" As discussed above, it is the Claimants\u2019 position that the speculative postulation of some likelihood of bias is insufficient to satisfy the test of a manifest lack of impartiality or independence.36\n\nResponse para. 19.\n\n47.\n\nWith all four cases still pending, the Claimants argue that there is in any event no basis to suggest that Dr. Alexandrov has a consistent history of deciding against Croatia. And the Respondent\u2019s theory that Dr. Alexandrov seeks to build an \"anti- Croatia\" \"cottage industry\" is belied by the fact that Dr. Alexandrov recently declined his nomination in the *Addiko v. Croatia* matter.37\n\nResponse para. 21.\n\n48.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s complaint about Dr. Alexandrov is also not credible in light of Croatia\u2019s own appointment practice. As mentioned above, Croatia, as respondent, appointed Professor Stern as its co-arbitrator in at least four ongoing investment arbitrations. Apparently, the Respondent is content to have the same arbitrator sit in \"45 percent of the ongoing ICSID arbitrations against the Respondent\" as long as it is an arbitrator of the Respondent\u2019s own choosing.38\n\nResponse para. 22.\n\n**(3) Consideration of the Same Legal Issue in Multiple Arbitrations Does Not Establish an Absence of Impartiality or Independence**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent complains that Dr. Alexandrov is also sitting in *Gavrilovi\u0107*, in which \"it is highly likely that... identical arguments relating to the compatibility of the intra-EU Austria-Croatia BIT with European Union (\"EU\") law will have been raised. This issue is one of those that are likely to be central to the present arbitration.\" The Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s own legal authorities, among others, undercut its position and make clear that consideration of the same legal issue in multiple arbitrations is not a sufficient basis for a challenge.39\n\nResponse para. 28.\n\n50.\n\nFirst, in *Electrabel v. Hungary*, for example, the unchallenged tribunal members were tasked with determining whether Professor Stern should be disqualified due to the factual and legal similarities that case and between *AES v. Hungary*40 (to which she had previously been appointed). They rejected the challenge, explaining that \"[i]nvestment and even commercial arbitration would become unworkable if an arbitrator were automatically disqualified on the ground only that he or she was exposed to similar legal or factual issues in concurrent or consecutive arbitrations.\"41\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erom\u00fc Kft. v. Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22) (\"*AES v. Hungary*\").\n\nResponse para. 30 (citing *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19), Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify a Member of the Tribunal (February 25, 2008) (\"*Electrabel v. Hungary*\")).\n\n51.\n\nSecond, the decision in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*, on which the Respondent relies, is unavailing. There, the claimants challenged Kazakhstan\u2019s co-arbitrator, Mr. Bruno Boesch, on the basis that he had previously served in the same role in *Ruby Roz v. Kazakhstan**42*, an UNCITRAL arbitration that was brought by a company owned by the brother-in-law of the owner of Caratube. *Caratube* and *Ruby Roz* were therefore not connected by an abstract question of law, but by a significant overlap in the underlying factual matrix, involving the same government measures vis-a-vis two entities in the same group of companies.43\n\n*Ruby Roz Agricol v. The Republic of Kazakhstan* (\"*Ruby Roz*\" or \"*Ruby Roz v. Kazakhstan*\"), UNCITRAL.\n\nResponse para. 33 (citing *Caratube*).\n\n52.\n\nThe unchallenged members of the *Caratube* tribunal upheld the challenge. In reaching their conclusion, the unchallenged tribunal members pointed to the close relation between the claimants in the two arbitrations and the fact that many of the same individuals who submitted witness statements in *Ruby Roz* were expected to submit witness statements in *Caratube*.44\n\nResponse para. 34.\n\n53.\n\nThird, the Claimants note that the Respondent had no hesitation in appointing Mr. Milos Ol\u00edk in *UniCredit v. Croatia* and *Addiko v. Croatia* - even though both cases concerned the same government measure. Presumably the same legal issue regarding the validity of intra-EU BITs will also be raised in both arbitrations, which arise under the Austria-Croatia BIT, and where Volterra Fietta acts as counsel for the Respondent. The *UniCredit* case is significantly more advanced, as the ICSID website indicates that the Respondent has already filed its objections to jurisdiction in that case.45\n\nResponse para. 39.\n\n54.\n\nImportantly, the unchallenged members of the *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* tribunal distinguished cases where any factual overlap is \"of a general and impersonal character\":\n\n*[T]here is a need immediately to stress that the situation where an arbitrator has possible prior knowledge of facts relevant to the outcome of the dispute must be carefully distinguished from the situation where an arbitrator has possible prior exposure to legal issues that would be equally relevant in that regard.*46\n\nResponse para. 35 (quoting *Caratube*).\n\n55.\n\nThe same rationale applied in I *ckale,* where a challenge was rejected because the overlapping issue between the cases was a legal issue and there was no significant overlap of facts.47\n\nResponse para. 37 (citing *Ickale \u00ednsaat Limited Sirketi v. Turkmenistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24), Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Professor Philippe Sands (July 11, 2014) (\"*Ickale*\")).\n\n56.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants argue that a challenge based on multiple appointments can be sustained only when these multiple cases suffer from a significant overlap of facts that are specific to the merits and the parties involved. It is insufficient that a similar, or even the same, legal issue arises in two cases (which involves facts only of a general and impersonal character). Here, there is no factual overlap of the kind described in *Caratube* : this arbitration and *Gavrilovi\u0107* concern different claimants; different measures; and entirely different sets of facts underlying the respective claims. That a similar legal issue may or may not arise in both cases does not establish a manifest lack of impartiality or independence.48\n\nResponse para. 38.\n\n**(4) The Purported History of Appointments Between Dr. Alexandrov and WilmerHale Does Not Establish an Absence of Impartiality or Independence**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s assertions that there is an \"extensive\" \"history of reciprocal appointments\" between Dr. Alexandrov and WilmerHale have no basis in reality. When acting as counsel, Dr. Alexandrov appointed Gary Born only twice. Two appointments, occurring over the course of eight years, hardly constitutes an extensive history of appointments. Other than the present case, Dr. Alexandrov has only been appointed twice by WilmerHale (and never before by the Claimants). None of these appointments rise to the level of requiring disclosure under the IBA Guidelines, nor do they fall afoul of the standard under Article 57.49\n\nResponse paras. 40-41.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants believe that the Respondent tries to make much of the fact that Dr. Alexandrov \"has chosen not to disclose\" his recent appointment by the claimant in *Grand Express*, for whom WilmerHale acts as co-counsel. But there was no reason for Dr. Alexandrov to do so since at no time had Dr. Alexandrov been appointed in more than three arbitrations in the last three years by WilmerHale, which is the disclosure standard in the IBA Guidelines.50\n\nResponse para. 43.\n\n59.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant emphasizes that the only authority the Respondent cites for its argument of supposedly problematic \"[c]ross-appointments\" does not support its claim here. In *SGS*, the claimant challenged Christopher Thomas, Pakistan\u2019s co-arbitrator, on the basis that his firm was acting as counsel on behalf of Mexico in an ongoing investment arbitration presided over by Jan Paulsson, Pakistan\u2019s counsel in *SGS*. The unchallenged tribunal members rejected the challenge:\n\n*Such an inference is, so far as we can see, bereft of any basis in the facts of this proceeding; what we have here is simply a supposition, a speculation merely. It is commonplace knowledge that in the universe of international commercial arbitration, the community of active arbitrators and the community of active litigators are both small and that, not infrequently, the two communities may overlap, sequentially if not simultaneously. **It is widely accepted that such overlap is not, by itself, sufficient ground for disqualifying an arbitrator**. Something more must be shown if a challenge is to succeed. In the instant case, that 'something more' has not been shown by the Claimant.*51\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, this reasoning is directly applicable here.52\n\nResponse para. 44 (citing *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator (December 19, 2002) para. 26 (emphasis added) (\"*SGS*\" or \"*SGS v. Pakistan*\")).\n\nResponse para. 45\n\n**(5) The Engagement of the Brattle Group in the** ***UniCredit*** **Arbitration Does Not Establish an Absence of Impartiality or Independence**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants argue that equally spurious are the Respondent\u2019s assertions that Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s ability to exercise independent judgment in this case is somehow impaired by UniCredit Bank Austria AG and Zagrebacka Banka d.d.\u2019s decision to instruct The Brattle Group as their experts in *UniCredit v. Croatia*.53\n\nResponse para. 46.\n\n61.\n\nRespondents in certain other investment arbitrations have challenged Dr. Alexandrov on the basis of his previous engagements of The Brattle Group when acting as counsel. To the best of the Claimants\u2019 knowledge, however, none of those challenges has been upheld. The mere existence of a challenge (much less an unsuccessful one) can hardly be used as objective evidence of Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s lack of impartiality or independence. In any event, the Claimants ague that it is non-sensical to suggest that the use of The Brattle Group by *different* claimants, represented by *different* counsel, in an arbitration in which Dr. Alexandrov is *not even serving as arbitrator* could have any impact on Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s ability to be impartial and independent in this arbitration. The Claimants can confirm, in any event, that they have no intention of instructing The Brattle Group as experts in this case.54\n\nResponse para. 47.\n\n62.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants argue that each of the Respondent\u2019s grounds for the disqualification of Dr. Alexandrov is baseless and that the cumulation of these grounds is not greater than its constituent parts. In the Claimants\u2019 view, the Respondent fares no better by combining its individually unpersuasive grounds for disqualification. The Claimants cite to *Electrabel v. Hungary* in which the unchallenged arbitrators stated, \"Two or more factors which do not satisfy the test required under Article 57, cannot by mere 'combination' meet that test.\" A multiple of zero is still nil, and the Respondent\u2019s Proposal must be dismissed, and the Respondent should be ordered to reimburse the costs the Claimants incurred on a full indemnity basis.55\n\nResponse para. 48.\n\n**C. Respondent's Further Observations**\n----------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nRespondent submitted further observations on its proposal following correspondence from ICSID communicating Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s decision not to submit observations on the proposal. In its further observations, the Respondent discussed the bases for its proposal and addressed three points which are discussed further below. They are (i) further comments on the relevant legal standard; (ii) the Claimants\u2019 supposed agreement with the facts underlying the proposal; and (iii) the Respondent\u2019s view on the effect of Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s decision not to submit observations on the proposal.\n\n**(1) Respondent Agrees that a Lack of Impartiality or Independence Must Be Manifest**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nContrary to the Claimants\u2019 assertion, the Respondent has explicitly acknowledged that the relevant legal standard requires that the alleged lack of independence or impartiality be manifest, meaning \"evident\" or \"obvious\". The Respondent submits that its proposal meets this threshold particularly in this instance where the Claimants and Dr. Alexandrov do not refute its factual basis.56\n\nFurther Observations para. 5.\n\n65.\n\nFurther, the facts put forward by the Respondent must be considered as a whole, and it would be illogical and deceptive to consider each fact supporting the Respondent\u2019s proposal in isolation.57\n\nFurther Observations para. 9.\n\n66.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants themselves rely on multiple legal authorities which support the view that all facts must be considered as a whole, when assessing whether a member of a tribunal can exercise independent and impartial judgment. By way of example, in *Tidewater* and in *Alpha Projektholding*, the unchallenged tribunal members took a holistic approach to the facts submitted in support of the Disqualification Proposal. The other tribunal members in these cases noted that a particular factual assertion should be viewed \"in combination with other factors\" and that certain factors can be \"sufficient in conjunction with [other] facts or circumstances to tip the balance\" in favor of disqualification.58\n\nFurther Observations para. 11 (citing *Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5), Decision on Claimants\u2019 Proposal to Disqualify Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrator (December 23, 2010) (\"*Tidewater*\"); *Alpha Projektholding GmbH v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator Dr. Yoram Turbowicz (March 19, 2010) (\"*Alpha Projektholding*\")).\n\n**(2) Neither the Claimants nor Dr. Alexandrov Deny the Facts Underlying Respondent\u2019s Proposal**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimants do not challenge the accuracy of the factual evidence underlying the Respondent\u2019s proposal, because they cannot.59 According to the Respondent, there is no factual dispute with the Claimants on the following:\n\nFurther Observations para. 17.\n\n68.\n\nFirst, the Claimants do not dispute that Dr. Alexandrov has been repeatedly appointed by claimants in investment treaty arbitrations. In particular, the Respondent highlighted that Dr. Alexandrov has served as claimant-appointed co-arbitrator in \"[36] cases out of the total [39] known investment treaty arbitrations in which he sat as an arbitrator.\" The Claimants do not challenge this statement.60\n\nFurther Observations para. 18 (the tally having been updated by the Respondent in its Further Observations due to a recent appointment).\n\n69.\n\nSecond, the Claimants do not dispute that Dr. Alexandrov has been repeatedly appointed in investment treaty arbitrations against the Republic of Croatia. In its Disqualification Proposal, the Respondent confirmed that Dr. Alexandrov had been nominated in five out of ten investment treaty arbitrations against the Respondent as the claimants\u2019 co-arbitrator.61\n\nFurther Observations para. 19.\n\n70.\n\nThird, the Claimants do not dispute that there have been extensive cross-appointments between WilmerHale and Dr. Alexandrov. In this regard, the Claimants acknowledge that Dr. Alexandrov has appointed Gary Born on two occasions and that WilmerHale has nominated Dr. Alexandrov on four occasions.62\n\nFurther Observations para. 20\n\n71.\n\nFourth, the Claimants do not dispute that Dr. Alexandrov has recently been nominated in a fourth case by WilmerHale in *Grand Express.* In addition, the Claimants do not deny that Dr. Alexandrov failed to disclose this new appointment to the Tribunal and the Parties despite his clear obligation to do so.63\n\nFurther Observations para. 21.\n\n72.\n\nLast, the Claimants do not dispute that Dr. Alexandrov has been repeatedly challenged in multiple investment treaty arbitrations on account of his previous engagements with The Brattle Group, nor that The Brattle Group is involved in the related proceeding *UniCredit*.64\n\nFurther Observations para. 22.\n\n**(3) It Is Significant that Dr. Alexandrov Chose Not to Submit Observations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nDr. Alexandrov has declined to submit any observations on the Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal. In the Respondent\u2019s view, this indicates that Dr. Alexandrov has chosen not to challenge any of the facts to be found or conclusions to be reached in the Respondent\u2019s Proposal. Further, the Respondent observes that Dr. Alexandrov has also chosen not to affirm his independence or impartiality.65\n\nFurther Observations paras. 48-52.\n\n**III. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n---------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Chairman has considered the Parties\u2019 submissions, summarized above, and decides as follows.\n\n**A. Timeliness**\n-----------------\n\n75.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n76.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case by case basis.66\n\nSee *BSG Resources Limited, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) SARL v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Arbitral Tribunal (December 28, 2016) para. 60 (\"*BSG*\"); *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (December 13, 2013) para. 73 (\"*Burlington*\"); *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30) Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (May 5, 2014) para. 39 (\"*Conoco*\"); *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal (February 4, 2014) para. 68 (\"*Abaclat*\").\n\n77.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent filed the Proposal 13 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, which was the Respondent\u2019s first opportunity to propose the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Chapter V of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9. The Claimants do not contest the timeliness of the proposal. In the circumstances, the Chairman considers that this disqualification proposal was promptly filed for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**B. The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\n\n79.\n\nA majority of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"67 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.68\n\nE.g., *BSG* para. 53, *Burlington* para. 68 n.83; *Abaclat* para. 71 n.25; *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Jos\u00e9 Maria Alonso (November 12, 2013) para. 61 n.43 (\"*Blue Bank*\"); *Repsol, S.A. and Repsol Butano, S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/38), Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Arbitrators Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a and Claus von Wobeser (December 13, 2013) para. 73 n.58 (\"Repsol\"); *Conoco* para. 39.\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Second Edition (2d Ed. 2009), page 1202 paras. 134-154.\n\n80.\n\nThe disqualification proposal alleges that Dr. Alexandrov manifestly lacks the qualities required by Article 14(1). Article 14(1) provides:\n\n*Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n81.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions*\" (guaranteed independence in exercising their functions), the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.69\n\nThe parties agree on this point at Application paras. 16-17; Response para. 4; see also *BSG* para. 56; *Burlington* para. 65, *Abaclat* para. 74, *Blue Bank* para. 58, *Repsol* para. 70, *Conoco* para. 50.\n\n82.\n\nImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \"protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case *.*\"70\n\n*BSG* para. 57; *Burlington* para. 66; *Abaclat* para. 75; *Blue Bank* para. 59; *Repsol* para. 71; *Conoco* para. 51.\n\n83.\n\nArticles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.71 All relevant facts shall be taken into account in establishing the appearance of dependence or bias.72\n\n*BSG* para. 57; *Burlington* para. 66; *Abaclat* para. 76; *Blue Bank* para. 59; Repsol para. 71; *Conoco* para. 52.\n\n*Tidewater* para. 40; *Alpha Projektholding GmbH* para. 64.\n\n84.\n\nThe legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\" As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.73\n\n*Burlington* para. 67; *Abaclat* para. 77; *Blue Bank* para. 60; *Repsol* para. 72; *Conoco* para. 53.\n\n85.\n\nThe Parties have referred to IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration in their arguments. While these rules or guidelines may serve as useful references, the Chairman is bound by the standard set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C. Merits**\n-------------\n\n86.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Chairman rejects the Respondent\u2019s Proposal. The grounds alleged for the disqualification of Dr. Alexandrov do not meet the required standard, either individually or taken cumulatively.\n\n**(1) Multiple Appointments by Other Claimants in ICSID Cases and in ICSID Cases Against Croatia**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe first ground of the Respondent\u2019s proposal concerns Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s multiple appointments by claimants generally and by other claimants in cases against Croatia in particular. The Chairman notes that the Parties do not dispute the tally of cases in which Dr. Alexandrov has been appointed by claimants or appointed by claimants in cases against Croatia.74 Nor do they dispute that the criteria for disqualification due to multiple appointments are \"qualitative rather than quantitative.\"75 Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the number of appointments caused \"an increased likelihood that an arbitrator will be at the very least unconsciously biased in favour of the appointing party\" on whom Dr. Alexandrov relies for professional income.76\n\nProposal paras. 27, 35; see Response para. 7.\n\nProposal para.48; see Response para. 12.\n\nProposal para.36.\n\n88.\n\nThe decisions in *Tidewater* and *Vivendi I* are instructive in this regard. In *Tidewater*, the unchallenged arbitrators stated that \"multiple appointments as arbitrator by the same party in unrelated cases are neutral, since in each case the arbitrator exercises the same independent function.\"77 The Chairman finds that the same principle applies in this case to multiple appointments by different claimants, even if they are in cases against the same respondent. In *Vivendi I*, the unchallenged arbitrators stated that a finding that a lack of impartiality or independence is manifest \"must exclude reliance on speculative assumptions or arguments\" and that \"the circumstances actually established... must negate or place in clear doubt the appearance of impartiality.\"78\n\n*Tidewater* para. 60.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*,ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee (October 3, 2001) para. 25 (\"*Vivendi I*\").\n\n89.\n\nThe Chairman finds that the Respondent has not submitted any evidence of Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s bias beyond allegations of unconscious bias nor has the Respondent submitted evidence of financial dependence. The Respondent\u2019s allegations of unconscious bias and financial dependence are the kind of speculative assumptions or arguments that would not lead a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s appointments by claimants to conclude that the alleged lack of impartiality or independence is manifest. As a result, the Chairman rejects the Respondent\u2019s Proposal based on this ground.\n\n**(2) Consideration of the Same Legal Issue in Multiple Arbitrations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nSecond, the Respondent proposes Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s disqualification because he may consider the same legal issues in this case and in *Gavrilovi\u0107,* another ICSID case against Croatia under the same BIT.\n\n91.\n\nThe Chairman agrees that where a proposal for disqualification rests on consideration of the same legal issue in multiple arbitrations, the mere exposure of an arbitrator to the same legal issue in multiple arbitrations is insufficient to disqualify that arbitrator.79 There must be an additional\u2014significant\u2014overlap of facts that are specific to the merits and the parties involved, as was the case in *Caratube*.80\n\nSee, e.g., Ic *kale* paras. 119-120.\n\n*Caratube* paras. 78, 84, 86, 90 (upholding a proposal to disqualify due to a significant overlap in the underlying facts with another case).\n\n92.\n\nAside from the possibility that the same legal issue may arise in both *Gavrilovi\u0107* and this case, and that the cases arise out of the same BIT, there is no similarity between the two cases let alone a significant overlap in facts and parties.81 Thus, there is no basis for a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts alleged to conclude that Dr. Alexandrov manifestly lacks impartiality and independence on this ground.\n\nResponse para. 38; Further Observations para. 38.\n\n**(3) The Alleged History of Appointments between Dr. Alexandrov and WilmerHale**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThird, it is not contested that as counsel Dr. Alexandrov appointed Gary Born twice in other arbitration proceedings. It is also not contested that WilmerHale has proposed Dr. Alexandrov to act as an arbitrator in this case and three others, *J&P-AVAX S.A.* and *Grand Express* in which he accepted the appointment and *Addiko* in which he declined the appointment.82\n\nProposal paras. 39-40; Response paras. 41-43.\n\n94.\n\nBoth Parties rely on the decision on the proposal for disqualification filed in *SGS v. Pakistan*, which states in relevant part,\n\n*It is commonplace knowledge that in the universe of international commercial arbitration, the community of active arbitrators and the community of active litigators are both small and that, not infrequently, the two communities may overlap, sequentially if not simultaneously. It is widely accepted that such an overlap is not, by itself, sufficient ground for disqualifying an arbitrator. Something more must be shown if a challenge is to succeed.*83\n\n*SGS para.* 25.\n\n95.\n\nThe Chairman is persuaded that without \"something more\", this tally of \"crossappointments\" would not by itself demonstrate to a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the evidence that Dr. Alexandrov manifestly lacks the qualities required under Article 14(1). The Respondent has not proffered any other evidence of Dr. Alexandrov\u2019s bias in favor of WilmerHale. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s Proposal is rejected on this ground.\n\n**(4) The Potential Expert Testimony of The Brattle Group in** ***UniCredit***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe last ground of the Respondent\u2019s proposal relates to the purported use of The Brattle Group, with whom Dr. Alexandrov allegedly has a longstanding professional relationship, by the claimants in *UniCredit*, another ICSID case against Croatia involving the same state measure and BIT. According to the Respondent, \"[I]t is within the public domain that the Brattle Group is to provide expert testimony on quantum\" in *UniCredit*.84 But it is noted that the Respondent does not cite to or exhibit the referenced information in the public domain.\n\nProposal at para. 43.\n\n97.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants have not retained The Brattle Group, and Dr. Alexandrov should not be privy to The Brattle Group\u2019s expert testimony in *UniCredit* because he is not an arbitrator in that proceeding. On these facts, there is no basis for a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of these facts to conclude that Dr. Alexandrov manifestly lacks the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention because the claimants in *UniCredit* purportedly retained The Brattle Group.\n\n**(5) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n98.\n\nIn sum, the Chairman finds that a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts alleged and the Parties\u2019 arguments on each ground would not conclude that they evidence a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Nor does the Chairman find that the cumulation of the facts alleged and the Parties\u2019 arguments lead to such a conclusion. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Proposal must be rejected.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n99.\n\nHaving considered all the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the Parties on each ground and cumulatively, and for the reasons stated above, the Chairman rejects the Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2020-09-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**T****ABLE OF** **S****ELECTED** **A****BBREVIATIONS AND** **D****EFINED** **T****ERMS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Achmea* Arbitration | 26 October 2010 Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension in *Achmea (formerly Eureko) v.

INTRODUCTION AND THE PARTIES**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration involves a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (***ICSID***) on the basis of the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1 November 1999 (the ***Austria-Croatia BIT*** or the ***BIT***) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the ***ICSID Convention***).\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Raiffeisen Bank International AG (***RBI***), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Austria (***Austria***), and Raiffeisenbank Austria d.d. (***RBHR***), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Croatia and 100 percent indirectly owned by RBI (together, ***Raiffeisen***).1\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para 13.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Croatia (***Croatia***).\n\n4.\n\nAccording to Raiffeisen, RBI became the first foreign bank to operate in Croatia when it established RBHR in 1994, leading to investments of approximately EUR 400 million in Croatia.2 This dispute concerns RBHR's issuance of loans denominated in Swiss Francs to Croatian consumers and businesses starting in 2004, and legislation enacted in Croatia in September 2015 converting the denomination of those loans into Euros. The Claimants allege that, with this conversion, Croatia breached the fair and equitable treatment obligations owed under the Austria-Croatia BIT, causing damages of approximately EUR 64.5 million (before interest).3\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para 2.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, Sections V and VI.\n\n5.\n\nThe merits of Raiffeisen's claims are not now before the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal has bifurcated the Respondent's preliminary objections for separate consideration (the ***Preliminary Objections***). The main issue in this Preliminary Objection phase is whether, as Croatia contends, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction of this dispute under the ICSID arbitration clause in Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT by operation of Article 11(2) of the BIT because Article 9 and substantive protections of the BIT are incompatible with the European Union *acquis communautaire* (the ***EU*** and the ***acquis***). Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT provides in full:\n\n*The Contracting Parties are not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it is incompatible with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.*4\n\nAgreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1 November 1999 (the ***BIT***) (C-4).\n\n7.\n\nMuch of the Parties' focus, and hence the Tribunal's focus, is on the direct and indirect import of the 6 March 2018 Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the ***CJEU***) in the highly-publicized intra-EU BIT case of *Slowakische Republik v. Achmea B.V.* (the ***Achmea Judgment***) on the proper application of Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT.5\n\n*Slowakische Republik v. Achmea B.V*., Case C-284/16, Judgment of the Court, 6 March 2018 (the ***Achmea Judgment***) (RLM-31).\n\n8.\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal, by a majority, dismisses Croatia's Preliminary Objections and determines that it has jurisdiction to proceed to consider the merits of Raiffeisen's claims.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 September 2017, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration of the same date from RBI and RBHR against Croatia, together with Exhibits C-1 to C-76 and Legal Authorities CLM-1 to CLM-27.\n\n10.\n\nOn 15 September 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Institution Rules provides that an ICSID arbitration \"shall be deemed to have been instituted on the registration of the request.\" In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n11.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Ms. Lucy Reed, a national of the United States of America and (as of appointment) a Professor on the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Professor Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of the Republic of Bulgaria, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. Lazar Tomov, a national of the Republic of Bulgaria, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the ***ICSID Arbitration Rules***), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and, therefore, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Alex B. Kaplan, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, Croatia filed a proposal for disqualification of Professor Alexandrov (the ***Disqualification Proposal***), together with Exhibits R-1 to R-12 and Legal Authorities RLM-1 to RLM-17. The proceeding was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n15.\n\nBy ICSID letter of 2 March 2018, the Tribunal set out a procedural calendar and invited the Parties and Professor Alexandrov to make submissions concerning the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n16.\n\nOn 8 March 2018, in response to the Tribunal's invitation, RBI and RBHR filed their Response to the Disqualification Proposal, together with Exhibits C-77 to C-83 and Legal Authorities CLM-28 to CLM-36.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 12 March 2019, ICSID informed the Parties that Professor Alexandrov would not be submitting observations on the Parties' submissions related to the Disqualification Proposal, and Ms. Reed and Mr. Tomov invited the Parties to file any further observations in connection with the Disqualification Proposal simultaneously by 20 March 2018.\n\n18.\n\nOn 20 March 2018, Croatia filed its Further Observations on the Disqualification Proposal, together with Exhibit R-13 and Legal Authorities RLM-18 and RLM-19. On the same date, RBI and RBHR informed the Tribunal that they would not submit further observations.\n\n19.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, ICSID transmitted to the Parties Mr. Tomov's letter recusing himself from participating in the decision on the Disqualification Proposal and explained that, in the circumstances, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council would make the decision.\n\n20.\n\nOn 17 May 2018, the Chairman of the Administrative Council issued his decision rejecting the Disqualification Proposal. The proceeding was then resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n21.\n\nOn 14 June 2018, Mr. Tomov updated his disclosure statement to reflect that, among other things, he was serving as co-counsel for the Republic of Bulgaria in a number of investment arbitrations in which Bulgaria had raised or intended to raise jurisdictional objections on the basis of the *Achmea* Judgment. Mr. Tomov explained that his responsibilities as co-counsel in those cases did not relate to *Achmea* issues, and he believed that this role did not affect his independence and impartiality as an arbitrator in this case.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent did not raise any concerns with Mr. Tomov's updated disclosure. By letter dated 22 June 2018, the Claimants stated that they would not object to Mr. Tomov's continuing to serve as arbitrator. Anticipating that Croatia would raise jurisdictional defenses based on the *Achmea* Judgment, the Claimants stated:\n\n\u2026 *the Claimants take particular note of Mr. Tomov's assurances that his responsibility as co-counsel* [for Bulgaria] *does not affect his independence and impartiality. The Claimants also take note of his assurances that he has no involvement in Bulgaria's decision to make this objection or in the preparation of Bulgaria's written and oral pleadings related to it.*  \n*The Claimants assume that should any of these circumstances change,*  \n*Mr. Tomov will promptly inform the parties.*\n\n23.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by teleconference on 25 June 2018.\n\n24.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 19 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on various procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides that, among other things, the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, the procedural language is English, and the place of proceeding is Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out a schedule for the Preliminary Objections phase of the proceeding.\n\n25.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, RBI and RBHR filed their Memorial on the Merits, together with the Damages Assessment Report of Dr. Manuel A. Abdala of Compass Lexicon (with Exhibits MA-1 to MA-52), Exhibits C-84 to C-236, and Legal Authorities CLM-37 to CLM 128.\n\n26.\n\nOn 22 November 2018, the European Commission (the ***EC***) filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (the ***EC's Application***) pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n27.\n\nOn 30 November 2018, Croatia filed its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Request to Suspend the Proceedings on the Merits, together with Exhibits R-14 to R-18 and Legal Authorities RLM-20 to RLM-53.\n\n28.\n\nBy ICSID letter of 3 December 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file any observations on the EC's Application by 14 December 2018.\n\n29.\n\nOn 14 December 2018, RBI and RBHR filed their Response to Croatia's Preliminary Objections (the ***Claimants' Response***), together with Exhibits C-237 to C-239 and Legal Authorities CLM-129 to CLM-161. In their Response, the Claimants referred to a 12 October 2018 Decision on Jurisdiction in *UniCredit Bank Austria AG and Zagreba\u010dka Banka d.d. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/31) (the ***UniCredit Decision***), involving the Austria-Croatia BIT.\n\n30.\n\nAlso on 14 December 2018, the Parties filed their observations on the EC's Application. Raiffeisen's observations included Exhibits C-240 and C-241 and Legal Authorities CLM-162 to CLM-165. Croatia's observations included Legal Authorities RLM-54 to RLM-59.\n\n31.\n\nOn 18 December 2018, the Tribunal invited Croatia to provide a copy of the *UniCredit* Decision for the record.\n\n32.\n\nOn the same date, 18 December 2018, Croatia informed the Tribunal that the Claimants apparently had obtained a copy of the *UniCredit* Decision \"in violation of the procedures of that case\" and that Croatia could not \"properly produce the *UniCredit* Decision in this present proceeding.\" Croatia requested that any references to the *UniCredit* Decision be struck from Raiffeisen's Response or, in the alternative, that the Tribunal give no weight to Raiffeisen's description of the *UniCredit* Decision in its ruling.\n\n33.\n\nBy email dated 19 December 2018, the Claimants objected to Croatia's refusal to provide a copy of the *UniCredit* Decision on grounds, among others, that Croatia had failed to identify the specific procedures in the *UniCredit* arbitration that would bar sharing the *UniCredit* Decision with the Tribunal or to assert that Croatia was under a confidentiality order preventing the same. Raiffeisen requested the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences as a result of Croatia's failure to produce the *UniCredit* Decision.\n\n34.\n\nOn 21 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning Croatia's Preliminary Objections. The Tribunal ordered as follows in paragraph 73 of Procedural Order No. 2:\n\na) the Respondent's Preliminary Objections\u2014that (i) the BIT is not incompatible with the EU *acquis* and (ii) the Claimants do not qualify as \"investors\" and hold qualifying \"investments\" under the BIT\u2014were bifurcated for preliminary resolution;\n\nb) the Claimants' request to proceed with the bifurcated preliminary issues without suspension of the proceedings on the merits was denied;\n\nc) the Parties were ordered to consult to attempt to agree on the length of the hearing on the Preliminary Objections and to identify possible hearing dates, with the Claimants' request for an accelerated timetable deemed denied;\n\nd) the Claimants' request that the Respondent be ordered to raise all preliminary objections, whether going to jurisdiction, competence, or admissibility, for inclusion in the bifurcated Preliminary Objections phase was granted;\n\ne) by 7 January 2019, the Respondent was either to provide to the Tribunal and the Claimants a copy of the *UniCredit* Decision on a confidential basis or to provide information as to the specific procedures preventing this step;\n\nf) the Respondent's requests either to strike all references to the *UniCredit* Decision from the Claimants' Response or to give no weight to those references were denied as premature, with leave to reapply; and\n\ng) the Claimants' request for adverse inferences in relation to the import of the *UniCredit* Decision was denied as premature, with leave to reapply.\n\n35.\n\nOn 31 December 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that Croatia had agreed to provide the Claimants and the Tribunal with a copy of the *UniCredit* Decision on a confidential basis, and that the Parties had also agreed that the *UniCredit* Decision and Procedural Order No. 2 could be shared on a confidential basis with tribunals in other arbitration proceedings involving Croatia.\n\n36.\n\nOn the same date, 31 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 granting the EC's Application in part. In specific:\n\na) the EC was invited to file a written submission limited to the legal consequences for this arbitration of the *Achmea* Judgment by 14 January 2019;\n\nb) the Parties were invited to include observations on the EC's submission in their respective memorials on jurisdiction;\n\nc) absent the Parties' agreement, the EC would not have access to the record or any documents pertaining to this arbitration;\n\nd) the Tribunal reserved its decision on further procedural steps, if any;\n\ne) the Tribunal reserved any decision on the allocation of costs and fees related to the EC's submissions; and\n\nf) Procedural Order No. 3 was to be communicated to the EC, which should not communicate it to third parties or make use of it outside this arbitration.\n\n37.\n\nOn 7 January 2019, pursuant to paragraph 73(e) of Procedural Order No. 2, and after having received from the *UniCredit* tribunal the decision on the confidentiality of the *UniCredit* Decision, Croatia provided the *UniCredit* \"Decision on the Respondent's Article 9 Objection to Jurisdiction\" dated 12 October 2018 to the Tribunal and the Claimants.\n\n38.\n\nOn 11 January 2019, Croatia requested an exception to the order in paragraph 73(d) of Procedural Order No. 2, specifically with regard to its intended objection based on the alleged illegality under Croatian law of certain of Raiffeisen's investments (the ***Illegality Objection***).\n\n39.\n\nOn 14 January 2019, the EC filed an *Amicus Curiae* Brief in this arbitration, including Annexes EC-1 to EC-30.\n\n40.\n\nOn 15 January 2019, RBI and RBHR filed observations on Croatia's request of 11 January 2019 concerning the Illegality Objection, asking the Tribunal either to join all of Croatia's jurisdictional objections to the merits or to maintain its order in paragraph 73(d) of Procedural Order No. 2 and include the Illegality Objection in the Preliminary Objections phase.\n\n41.\n\nBy correspondence from ICSID on 28 January 2019, the Tribunal invited the EC to resubmit its *Amicus Curiae* Brief, which contained erroneous references to the Poland-Slovak Republic BIT, with corrected references to this arbitration and to include a redline reflecting the corrections.\n\n42.\n\nAlso on 28 January 2019, the Tribunal invited Croatia to submit by 1 February 2019 further observations on Raiffeisen's observations of 15 January 2019 concerning the Illegality Objection.\n\n43.\n\nOn 1 February 2019, Croatia filed a response to the Claimants' observations of 15 January 2019, together with Legal Authorities RLM-60 to RLM-62.\n\n44.\n\nOn 7 February 2019, in Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal issued its decision on the scope of the Preliminary Objections addressed in Croatia's request of 11 January 2019, ordering as follows:\n\na) the Respondent would be allowed to raise its Illegality Objection in the merits phase, should the arbitration proceed past the bifurcated preliminary phase;\n\nb) the Claimants' request that the Tribunal join the Illegality Objection to the merits phase or, in the alternative, include the Illegality Objection in the Preliminary Objections phase was denied;\n\nc) the issue of costs was reserved; and\n\nd) pursuant to paragraph 73(c) of Procedural Order No. 2, the Parties were to return to their consultations to attempt to agree on the length of the hearing for the Preliminary Objections, and to revert to the Tribunal on the same by 15 February 2019.\n\n45.\n\nOn 14 February 2019, Croatia filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction (the ***Respondent's Memorial***), together with the Legal Opinion of Professor Paul Craig (Hon QC) (with Legal Authorities PC-1 to PC-60) (the ***Craig Opinion***), Exhibits R-19 to R-25, and Legal Authorities RLM-63 to RLM-109.\n\n46.\n\nOn 15 February 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on a three-day hearing for the Preliminary Objections from 4\u20136 November 2019, but they had been unable to agree on an accelerated timetable. By ICSID's correspondence of 27 February 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that it had reserved the 4\u20136 November 2019 hearing dates.\n\n47.\n\nOn 6 March 2019, the EC submitted a revised version of its *Amicus Curiae* Brief, correcting ministerial errors.\n\n48.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, pursuant to the procedural timetable at Annex B of Procedural Order No. 1, each side requested the Tribunal to rule on contested document requests and submitted a Redfern Schedule for this purpose.\n\n49.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 setting out its decisions on the contested document requests in the Parties' respective Redfern Schedules. The Tribunal further ordered that \"[i]f a Party wishes to claim privilege for certain documents whose production is ordered, it must prepare a Privilege Log setting out the necessary details for each document,\" to be submitted by 26 April 2019.\n\n50.\n\nOn 1 May 2019, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5, Croatia submitted a Privilege Log listing 48 documents for which it claimed privilege from production, accompanied by Legal Authorities RLM-110 to RLM-112.\n\n51.\n\nThere followed an extensive exchange of positions on Croatia's assertions of privilege, with leave of the Tribunal. Raiffeisen submitted comments, including Legal Authority CLM-166, on 8 May 2019; Croatia replied on 14 May 2019, submitting Legal Authority RLM-113; and Raiffeisen submitted additional comments on 17 May 2019.\n\n52.\n\nOn 20 May 2018, in Procedural Order No. 6, the Tribunal denied each of the Respondent's privilege claims and ordered Croatia to produce the 48 documents listed in its Privilege Log by 24 May 2019. The Tribunal also granted the Claimants an extension of time until 31 May 2019 to file their counter-memorial on preliminary objections.\n\n53.\n\nOn 24 May 2019, the Respondent's counsel informed the Tribunal that Croatia could not comply with Procedural Order No. 6 to produce the 48 documents listed in the Privilege Log pending receipt of express written permission from the EC to do so.\n\n54.\n\nOn 28 May 2019, the Tribunal directed the Respondent's counsel to provide copies by 30 May 2019 of: (a) the authorities on which they relied in support of the asserted requirement for express written permission from the EC to produce each of the 48 documents at issue, and; (b) the letters they had sent to the EC seeking such permission.\n\n55.\n\nOn 31 May 2019, RBI and RBHR filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (the ***Claimants' Counter-Memorial***), together with the Legal Opinion of Sir Francis Jacobs KCMG, QC (with Legal authorities FJ-1 to FJ-42) (the ***Jacobs Opinion***), the Witness Statement of Mr. Robert Kaukal (with Exhibits RK-1 to RK-6), Exhibits C-242 to C-252, and Legal Authorities CLM-167 to CLM-217.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated 30 May 2019, the Respondent provided copies of unanswered emails sent to the EC concerning the 48 withheld documents and stated as follows (footnotes omitted):\n\n*In accordance with the Tribunal's direction of 28 May 2019, the Respondent confirms that the authorities on which it relies in support of the requirement for express written permission from the European Commission to produce the 48 documents listed in the Respondent's Privilege Log filed on 1 May 2019 are those set out in the Privilege Log and in subsequent correspondence. That is, each of the 48 documents listed in the Respondent's Privilege Log qualify as diplomatic archives, documents or official correspondence which are inviolable under Articles 24 and 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (to which both the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Austria are parties), as well as under customary international law. The inviolability of diplomatic archives, documents and official correspondence is a cornerstone of the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions, as set out in the Preamble to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and as confirmed by the widespread practice of both States and the European Union itself.*\n\n57.\n\nOn 4 June 2019, on invitation by the Tribunal, Raiffeisen submitted comments on Croatia's submission of 30 May 2019 concerning the allegedly privileged 48 documents. In addition to describing Croatia's unanswered emails to the EC as containing no support for the assertion that EC permission was necessary for production, the Claimants stated:\n\n*[T]he Respondent offers no legal basis whatsoever for its entirely new claim (not raised previously with its Privilege Log or in its letter of 14 May 2019) that the European Commission's consent is required to allow the Respondent to produce the 48 documents listed in its Privilege Log, as directed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 6. In fact, instead of addressing the alleged consent requirement, the Respondent merely repeats the baseless arguments invoking the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, customary international law and Protocol No. 7 to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that it had previously presented and that the Tribunal had already rejected as a purported legal basis for privilege in Procedural Order No. 6.*\n\n58.\n\nBy ICSID letter of 9 June 2019, the Tribunal stated that it could not find in the Respondent's 30 May 2019 submission any support for its claim of privilege against production based on the alleged requirement of express written permission from the EC. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal re-confirmed Procedural Order No. 6 and directed Croatia to produce the 48 documents listed in the Privilege Log by 21 June 2019. The Tribunal also invited the Parties' counsel to consult on a special purpose confidentiality undertaking, if that should be agreed to be helpful.\n\n59.\n\nOn 21 June 2019, Croatia again informed the Tribunal that it could not, without permission of the EC, produce the 48 documents. Croatia also reported that it was continuing efforts to obtain the EC's permission and would update the Tribunal on any further developments. On 28 June 2019, Raiffeisen again objected to Croatia's position.\n\n60.\n\nOn 9 August 2019, Croatia filed its Reply on Jurisdiction (the ***Respondent's Reply***), together with the Second Legal Opinion of Professor Craig (with Legal Authorities PC-61 to PC-65) (the ***Second Craig Opinion***), Exhibits R-26 to R-28, and Legal Authorities RLM-114 to RLM-126.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal here notes that, based on the Witness Statement of Mr. Robert Kaukal and Raiffeisen corporate documents exhibited with the Claimants' Counter-Memorial, the Respondent in its Reply stated that it would not maintain its Preliminary Objections that RBI and RBHR do not qualify as \"investors\" and did not make qualifying \"investments\" under the Austria-Croatia BIT.6\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction (the ***Respondent's Reply***), para 4.\n\n62.\n\nOn 11 October 2019, RBI and RBHR filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the ***Claimants' Rejoinder***), together with the Second Legal Opinion of Sir Francis (with Legal Authority FJ-43) (the ***Second Jacobs Opinion***), Exhibits C-253 to C-254, and Legal Authorities CLM-218 to CLM-241.\n\n63.\n\nOn 21 October 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n64.\n\nOn 24 October 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning organization of the hearing.\n\n65.\n\nOn 31 October 2019, Croatia filed Exhibits R-29 and R-30 and, on 4 November 2019, Legal Authorities RLM-127 to RLM-137.\n\n66.\n\nThe Hearing on Preliminary Objections was held in Washington, D.C. from 4\u20136 November 2019 (the ***Hearing***).

The Parties made no comments.\n\n*I write to inform you that my appointments as Professor on the Law Faculty and Director of the Centre for International Law at the National University of Singapore ended on 31 December 2019. Going forward, I will work only as an independent arbitrator.*\n\n*Effective today (6 January 2020) I have become a member of Arbitration Chambers, which has now opened an office in New York (in addition to Hong Kong and London). All members of Arbitration Chambers are independent arbitrators who operate entirely separately from one another. Members have no financial interest in the chambers, and Arbitration Chambers takes the necessary steps to maintain confidentiality and data security.*\n\n*I bring this to your attention for the sake of good order. My new affiliation has no effect on my ongoing independence and impartiality.*\n\n71.\n\nOn 6 February 2020, RBI and RBHR filed their Post-Hearing Brief, together with Legal Authorities CLM-242 to CLM-249 (the ***Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief***).\n\n72.\n\nOn 6 March 2020, the Claimants' submitted their Submissions on Costs and the Respondent submitted its Statement on Costs.\n\n73.\n\nOn 8 June 2020, the Tribunal Secretary transmitted to the Parties Ms. Reed's Further Disclosure of 6 June 2020, set out below.

The co-arbitrators who appointed me are Professor Albert Jan van den Berg and Professor Stephan Schill, who replaced Professor Dr Karl-Heinz Boecksteigel.*\n\n*I do not consider that this appointment raises any actual or apparent conflict with the instant case of Raiffeisen v Croatia. Although the Strabag v Poland arbitration is not public, I am able to disclose that the relevant treaty is the Austria-Poland BIT and the Tribunal issued its Partial Award on jurisdictional objections in early March 2020. There is no overlap between the arbitrators or the counsel in Strabag v Poland and the instant case.*\n\n74.\n\nOn 11 June 2020, Raiffeisen requested that the 24 March 2020 Decision on the Respondent's Application for Reversal of the Article 9 Decision and Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility in *UniCredit Bank Austria AG and Zagreba\u010dka Banka d.d. v. Republic of Croatia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/16/31) (the ***UniCredit Reconsideration Decision***) be admitted into the record. The Claimants explained that Croatia had disclosed the *UniCredit* Reconsideration Decision on the basis that it could be used in the present arbitration and had confirmed that redactions had been made in accordance with the confidentiality restrictions to which Croatia is subject in the *UniCredit* arbitration.\n\n75.\n\nOn 17 June 2020, with Croatia's consent, Raiffeisen requested that the 12 June 2020 Decision on Croatia's Jurisdictional Objection Related to the Alleged Incompatibility of the BIT with the EU *Acquis* in *Addiko Bank AG & Addiko Bank d.d. v.

KEY TREATY PROVISIONS**\n----------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Austria-Croatia BIT:10\n\nArticle 2: Promotion and Protection of Investments\n\n*(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory, promote, as far as possible, investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, admit such investments in accordance with its legislation and in any case accord such investments fair and equitable treatment.* \u2026\n\nArticle 9: Settlement of Investment Disputes\n\n*(1) Any dispute arising out of an investment, between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.*\n\n*(2) If a dispute according to paragraph 1 of this Article cannot be settled within three months of a written notification of sufficiently detailed claims, the dispute shall upon the request of the Contracting Party or of the investor of the other Contracting Party be subject to the following procedures:*\n\n*(a) to conciliation or arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature in Washington on 18 March 1965. In case of arbitration, each Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence of an individual arbitral agreement between the Contracting Party and the investor, to submit any such dispute to this Centre.

When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n89.\n\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the ***VCLT***):11\n\nArticle 31: General Rule of Interpretation\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty* \u2026\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions* \u2026\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the ***VCLT***) (CLM-129).\n\n90.\n\nThe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the ***TFEU***):12\n\nArticle 18\n\n*Within the scope of application of the Treaties, and without prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.*\n\n*The European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, may adopt rules designed to prohibit such discrimination.*\n\nArticle 49\n\n*Within the framework of the provisions set out below, restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State shall be prohibited.

BURDEN OF PROOF ON JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, based on accepted international practice, the Claimants bear the burden of proving the Tribunal's jurisdiction of their claims. In support, Croatia relies upon decisions of the ICSID tribunals in *Abaclat v. Argentina* and *Tulip v. Turkey*.13\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction (the ***Respondent's Memorial***), paras 5-6, citing *Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2011 (***Abaclat v. Argentina***) (RLM-63), para 678; and *Tulip Real Estate Investment and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue, 5 March 2013 (***Tulip v. Turkey***) (RLM-64), para 48.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants disagree, citing the Judgment of the International Court of Justice (the ***ICJ***) in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case in support of their argument that neither side bears the legal burden of proving jurisdiction. The Claimants state, \"each party bears the burden of proving the facts on which it relies, and the tribunal then considers these facts and the parties' legal arguments in deciding for itself whether jurisdiction exists.\"14\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (the ***Claimants' Counter-Memorial***), paras 123-125 citing *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada)*, Judgment, 4 December 1998, [1998] ICJ Reports 432 (***Fisheries Jurisdiction***) (CLM-193), paras 36-38. See also Claimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 126-129, wherein the Claimants cite three investment arbitration cases: *Muhammet \u00c7ap and Sehil In\u015faat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/6, Decision on Respondent's Objection to Jurisdiction, 13 February 2015 (CLM-201), paras 65-66, 119; *WNC Factoring Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-34, Award, 22 February 2017 (CLM-160), paras 293, 310; and *UniCredit Bank Austria AG and Zagreba\u010dka Banka d.d. v. Republic of Croatia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/31, Decision on the Respondent's Article 9 Objection to Jurisdiction, 12 October 2018 (the ***UniCredit Decision***) (CLM-210), para 89.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, although each side bears the burden to prove the factual allegations and legal arguments it has advanced in relation to jurisdiction, neither Raiffeisen nor the Respondent bears the legal burden of proving jurisdiction here. As to the reasons, the Tribunal can do no better than quote the reasoning of the ICJ in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* Judgment:15\n\n*The Court points out that the establishment or otherwise of jurisdiction is not a matter for the parties but for the Court itself. Although a party seeking to assert a fact must bear the burden of proving it, this has no relevance for the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction, which is a \"question of law to be resolved in the light of the relevant facts.\"*\n\n*That being so, there is no burden of proof to be discharged in the matter of jurisdiction. Rather, it is for the Court to determine from all the facts and taking into account all the arguments advanced by the Parties, \"whether the force of the arguments militating in favour of jurisdiction is preponderant, and to 'ascertain whether an intention on the part of the Parties exists to confer jurisdiction on it.'\"*\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction*, paras 37-38 (citations omitted).\n\n94.\n\nThe issue of jurisdiction here turns on the interpretation and application of the relevant articles of the Austria-Croatia BIT in the circumstances presented. This is properly the legal task of the Tribunal.\n\n**VI. INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 11(2) OF THE AUSTRIA-CROATIA BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) Article 11(2) as a Conflict Clause**\n------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent's main argument is that Article 11(2) is a specific conflict clause that directs the Tribunal to give precedence to the EU *acquis* over the BIT. The Respondent states:\n\n*Like any treaty, an intra-EU treaty has no self-standing legal basis under public international law independently from the legal effect given to it by the consent of its two contracting parties. If both contracting parties to an intra-EU treaty agree in the EU Treaties that the latter will take precedence over the former, there is no basis under public international law for a tribunal established under the bilateral treaty to ignore such a conflict rule.*16\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 21.\n\n96.\n\nCroatia asserts that, as a consequence, the Tribunal \"can safely disregard as inapposite the entire smokescreen of case law presented by the Claimants dealing with whether the EU Treaties take precedence over bilateral investment treaties or the [ECT] pursuant to the VCLT or the residual rules of public international law.\"17 Croatia describes Article 11(2) as \"sav[ing] this Tribunal from having to consider the residual rules in Article 30 of the VCLT,\"18 and argues that the cases cited by Raiffeisen, most of which are based on analyses of incompatibility under Article 30(3) of the VCLT, are unhelpful.19\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 17.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 26.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 26. *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 41.\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimants' primary position is that text of Article 11(2) of the BIT refers to incompatibility, and, therefore, Article 11(2) requires the same test of compatibility between treaties as Article 30(3) of the VCLT. Accordingly, the cases analyzing Article 30(3) of the VCLT, or which otherwise apply a test of compatibility, remain relevant and persuasive in interpreting Article 11(2) of the BIT.20 Croatia implicitly concedes this, says Raiffeisen, by invoking Article 30(3) of the VCLT as an alternative argument in the context of the import of the *Achmea* Judgment and the 15 January 2019 Declaration (discussed in Section VI.A(2)a below) and accepting that an Article 30(3) analysis would lead to the same result as direct application of Article 11(2).21\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the ***Claimants' Rejoinder***), para 18.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 70.\n\n98.\n\nRBI and RBHR find little utility in Croatia's attempt to differentiate Article 11(2) of the BIT from Article 30(3) of the VCLT on the basis that Article 11(2) refers not just to conflicting treaty norms but also expressly to the EU *acquis*. This is because the additional sources of the EU *acquis* cited by Croatia (discussed in Section VII.A(3) below) are irrelevant in the context of this case: the *Achmea* Judgment does not address ICSID arbitration and in any event cannot retroactively deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction, and neither the 15 January 2019 Declaration nor the General Agreement on Trade and Services (the ***GATS***) is part of the EU *acquis*.22\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 71. *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 39.\n\n**(2) Alternative Conflict Rules**\n----------------------------------\n\n***a. Article 30 of the VCLT***\n-------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nShould the Tribunal not accept Article 11(2) of the BIT as the controlling *lex specialis* conflict clause, Croatia argues in the alternative that the residual conflict rules in Article 30 of VCLT lead to the same result \u2013 lack of jurisdiction.23 Croatia relies on Article 30(2), which stipulates that \"[w]hen a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail,\" and Article 30(3), which specifies that \"the earlier treaty applies only to the extent its provisions are compatible \u2026.\"24 In this respect, as discussed below, Croatia denies that the relevant treaties must share the same subject matter; rather, it is sufficient if the earlier treaty and later treaty cannot be applied simultaneously without breach of one or the other.25 In the instant case, because the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction under Article 9 of the BIT would lead to Croatia and Austria violating their obligations under the TFEU, the BIT and the TFEU are necessarily incompatible under Article 30(3) of the VCLT.26\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 31, 34.\n\nVCLT (CLM-129), Article 30.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 131.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 32.\n\n***b. Conflict Clauses in EU Treaties***\n----------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nEven if Article 11(2) of the BIT does not preclude the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Respondent argues in the alternative that Article 4(3) of Treaty on the European Union (the ***TEU***, and, together with the ***TFEU***, the ***EU Treaties***) contains a dovetailing conflict clause giving the EU Treaties primacy over other intra-EU treaties, including the Austria-Croatia BIT.27\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 54.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants respond that the \"'principle' of 'primacy of EU law' on which Croatia relies is not a principle of international law at all,\" but an internal EU doctrine developed in CJEU jurisprudence.28 The Claimants do not accept that Article 4(3) of the TEU is a dovetailing conflict clause.29 The general recitation that EU Member States \"shall take any appropriate measure \u2026 to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the Union\" and \"facilitate the achievement of the Union's tasks and refrain from any measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the Union's objectives\" cannot automatically trump other specific treaty obligations. RBI and RBHR emphasize that \"[n]owhere does [Article 4(3) of the TEU] refer to the primacy of EU law or provide that in the event of a conflict, EU law will take priority.\"30\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 176.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 180.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 55.\n\n102.\n\nCroatia also relies on Declaration 17 of the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon for the proposition that EU law has primacy and takes precedence over intra-EU BITs.31 Declaration 17 provides in full:\n\n*The Conference* [of EU Member States] *recalls that, in accordance with well settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Treaties and the law adopted by the Union on the basis of the Treaties have primacy over the law of Member States, under the conditions laid down by the said case law.*32\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 25.\n\nTreaty of Lisbon, Declaration 17 (RLM-73).\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes Declaration 17 as \"an agreement relating to the TEU and TFEU that was made between all the contracting parties in connection with the conclusion of those [T]reaties,\" which confirms the \"cornerstone principle\" of the primacy enshrined in the EU *acquis*.33 Croatia contends that Declaration 17 is not limited to Member State domestic law, but expressly ties the principle of EU law primacy to CJEU case law.34 Invoking Article 31(2)(a) of the VCLT, Croatia argues that Declaration 17 \"must be included in the interpretation of the TEU and TFEU.\"35\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 124-125.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 25.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 125.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants disagree. They contend that the principle of the primacy of EU law set out in Declaration 17\u2014which expressly refers to \"primacy over the law of Member States\"\u2014 concerns the primacy of EU law over domestic law, not over extraneous treaties that exist and operate outside EU law.36 Given that Declaration 17 accompanied the 2009 Treaty of Lisbon, which amended the EU Treaties already in force, the Claimants highlight that it cannot accurately be said that Declaration 17 was made in connection with the \"conclusion\" of the EU Treaties.37 In any event, say the Claimants, there is no basis for extending the principle of EU law primacy to the level of general international law.38 Even if there were, the primacy principle would not alter the substantially similar legal analysis under Article 11(2) of the BIT or Article 30(3) of the VCLT,39 because Croatia would still need to meet the test of incompatibility and \"[i]f there is no incompatibility, there is nothing in relation to which the primacy of EU law can operate.\"40\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 56; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 177.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 110; Claimants' Rejoinder, para 57; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 178.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 111.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 58.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 112.\n\n105.\n\nIn its *Amicus Curiae* Brief, the EC takes the position that EU law prevails over all possible conflict rules applicable to Article 9 of the BIT and, because Article 9 is incompatible with EU law, the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction.41 In the alternative, relying on Article 30 and 59 of the VCLT, the EC argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Austria-Croatia BIT has been impliedly terminated.42\n\n*Amicus Curiae* Brief of the European Commission (the ***EC Amicus Brief***), Section 4.\n\nEC *Amicus* Brief, Section 3.\n\n**(3) The Meaning of \"incompatible\" under Article 11(2) of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Parties firmly disagree as to the methodology for determining whether the BIT is incompatible or compatible with the EU *acquis* for the purposes of Article 11(2).\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants' main position is that the test of incompatibility has a threshold requirement, based on Articles 30(3) and 59 of the VCLT, namely that the treaties to be compared have the same subject matter.43 Only if that threshold requirement is met should the Tribunal proceed to determine the incompatibility of the relevant treaties, here the Austria-Croatia BIT and the EU Treaties.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 24\n\n108.\n\nRBI and RBHR contend that because the BIT and the EU Treaties do not address the same subject matter, the threshold requirement is not met and thus the treaties are not incompatible. Therefore, Article 9 of the BIT, the investor-state arbitration clause, remains applicable. The Claimants emphasize that many investment treaty tribunals have consistently found that intra-EU BITs and the Energy Charter Treaty (the ***ECT***) do not have the same subject matter as the EU Treaties.44\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 67; Claimants' Rejoinder, para 25; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 31.\n\n109.\n\nCroatia charges Raiffeisen with applying the wrong test for incompatibility under Article 30 of the VCLT. Contending that it is not a necessary first step to examine the sameness of subject matter, Croatia urges the Tribunal to proceed directly to test whether the relevant treaty obligations in the earlier and later treaties can \"be complied with simultaneously\" without a state party breaching one of the treaties.45 The tribunals in the cases cited by the Claimants, which found that intra-EU BITs and the ECT do not have the same subject matter as the EU Treaties, did not take into account that \"two treaties can be incompatible without both treaties having substantially the same provisions.46 In particular, the Respondent relies on the reports of the International Law Commission (the ***ILC***) forming the *travaux* of the VCLT to support its claim that Article 30 of the VCLT does not require the sameness of subject matter in measuring incompatibility.47\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 32.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 132.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 134-135.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants respond that the VCLT *travaux* go beyond the ILC reports and include all the material of the United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties (the ***Conference***) from 1968 to 1969, as the Conference essentially used the ILC Draft Articles (and the ILC reports) as the basis for negotiating the final text of the VCLT.48 The Conference adopted the version of what would become Article 30, which included reference to sameness of subject matter, and the negotiators made clear that the sameness of subject matter requirement should be construed strictly.49\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 62.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 63.\n\n111.\n\nIn reply, Croatia refers back to another ILC report to show that the ILC considered the subject matter criterion to be only an exercise in labelling and categorizing treaties, and that the criterion seems \"already fulfilled if two different rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the same matter, or if, in other words, as a result of interpretation, the relevant treaties seem to point to different directions in their application by a party.\"50 Engaging in the exercise of labelling and categorizing treaties would necessarily mean that the EU Treaties could not conflict with a treaty in any of the areas they regulate, leading to the absurd result that the EU Treaties could be incompatible only with other treaties establishing other regional economic integration organizations.51\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 25, citing ILC, *Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law*, in Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission (A/CN.4/L.682) dated 13 April 2006 (the ***ILC Fragmentation Report***) (RLM-100), paras 21-23.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 26.\n\n112.\n\nRBI and RBHR do not accept that subject matter is merely a labelling exercise. The Claimants contend that \"[s]ameness of subject-matter is a textual requirement \u2026 and any difficulties associated with identifying subject-matter, or the practice of concluding treaties that might span one or more subject-matters, does not render this textual requirement meaningless,\" and that incompatibility depends on treaty content instead.52\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 22.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal pauses to note that the Parties ultimately agreed, in effect, that the test of incompatibility is whether the obligations in the two relevant treaties are such that compliance with one obligation would put a state in non-compliance with the other.53\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 48; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 18-19; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 39; Tr. 72:17-20 (Volterra).\n\n**(4) The Import of \"in force at any given time\"**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on how to interpret the phrase \"in force at any given time\" in Article 11(2) of the BIT, invoking arguments that they essentially reprise in connection with the retroactive applicability of the *Achmea* Judgment (discussed at Section VII.A(1)c below).\n\n115.\n\nRaiffeisen's position is that the phrase \"in force at any given time\" cannot mean in force \"at any time in the past, present or future.\"54 The phrase must instead refer to a specific moment in time as relevant to a particular issue, thus calling upon applicable rules of international law, including, most importantly, the critical date doctrine.55 In this case, for purposes of Article 9 of the BIT, the critical date is when an irrevocable agreement to arbitrate was formed, which was 15 September 2017, the date on which ICSID registered the Claimants' Request for Arbitration.56\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 201.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 43, 202. *See also* Claimants' Rejoinder, para 88.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 85.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize the importance of the words \"in force\" in Article 11(2):\n\n*The words \"in force,\" which immediately follow the words \"legal acquis of the European Union (EU),\" can only refer to the acquis as a body of law as it stood \u2013 was \"in force\" \u2013 at a given point in time. Article 11(2) refers to the state of the acquis \"in force\" at a point in time \u2013 which is also the only logical and natural reading: one can assess compatibility only against a concrete state of law, not against a fluid and indeterminate notion of legal rules that are ever subject to subsequent change and so can never be captured at the point in time when jurisdiction is established.*57\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 199.\n\n117.\n\nAccording to Raiffeisen, this interpretation properly accounts for the necessarily evolving nature of the EU *acquis* :\n\n*The acquis is by its nature and in its context something that changes from time to time. When Article 11(2) refers to the acquis \"in force at any given time,\" it refers to the body of EU law that is in force at that time \u2013 the given time \u2013 not at some future (or past) time. The term \"acquis\" does not refer to a future body of law, let alone a future body of law capable of producing retroactive legal effects.*58\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 87.\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that the tribunals in both *Addiko* and *UniCredit* reached the conclusion that analysis of compatibility requires an assessment of the evolving *acquis* actually in force on the critical date.59 The *Addiko* tribunal placed particular emphasis on the phrase \"in force at any given time,\" noting that the \"latter point about a 'given time' qualifies the former point about the scope of the relevant *acquis* (that it be the *acquis* then 'in force'),\" and so requires that \"the temporal inquiry must be into the state of the *acquis* itself (*i.e.*, what elements were or were not in force as part of the *acquis*, as of a particular date).\"60\n\nClaimants' Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, paras 4-9.\n\nClaimants' Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, paras 6-7, citing *Addiko* Decision, para 215 (CLM-250).\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent rejects as \"untenable\" the Claimants' suggestion that \"a snapshot in time is possible\" to apply Article 11(2).61 To the extent the phrase \"at any given time\" is relevant, says Croatia, \"the language is extensive, not restrictive:\"\n\n*To the extent that the Contracting Parties intended these words to add anything to the meaning of Article 11(2), they manifestly intended to give Article 11(2) as broad an application in time as possible. In the words of Sir Francis, the Claimants' legal expert at the Hearing, the term \"at any given time\" is \"not always a very precise formula.\" Sir Francis confirmed that \"it could be the date on which the judgment was given. It could be some other date which would be relevant for the purposes of these proceedings.\"*62\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 54, citing Tr. Day 3, 765:4-8 (Schwarz).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 57, citing Tr. Day 2, 467:3-8 (Sir Francis).\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"in force at any given time\" is a \"commonly used phrase\" which, when read in accordance with its ordinary meaning, \"makes it clear that this language is used *ex abundanti cautela* to ensure the broadest possible application of the EU *acquis*.\"63 This interpretation, says Croatia, accords with the purpose of Article 11(2) to subordinate the BIT to the *acquis*, while the *Addiko* tribunal's \"freeze-frame approach\" reflects \"an anachronistic misconception of the EU *acquis* now authoritatively confirmed to be incorrect\" that would \"perversely lead\" the Contracting Parties to violate the *acquis* \"and entirely deprive Article 11(2) of its purpose.\"64\n\nRespondent's Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, para 19.\n\nRespondent's Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, para 19.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's interpretation, which the Claimants say depends entirely on reading the words \"at any given time\" to constitute an embedded conditionality:\n\n*Croatia argues precisely that any event, regardless of when it occurs \u2013 such as the CJEU's judgment in Achmea or the 15 January Declaration \u2013 that purports to clarify the legal position at the critical date is capable of triggering Article 11(2) and depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Croatia seems to admit as such when it says that the reference to the acquis \"'at any given time' precisely accommodates the present situation in which the CJEU has \u2026 divined, clarified and confirmed the law as it stood at the critical date.\"*65\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 207, citing Respondent's Memorial, paras 47, 81 and Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 56.\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that the Respondent has given its irrevocable consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 9(2)(a) of the Austria-Croatia BIT, and has agreed under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention not to \"withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"66 According to the Claimants, Croatia's proposed interpretation of Article 11(2) is inconsistent with these undertakings.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 187-193. *See also* Claimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 130-142.\n\n123.\n\nCroatia charges the Claimants with misrepresenting its position, which \"does not depend on the terms 'at any given time' in Article 11(2)\" nor \"on Article 11(2) of the BIT being read as if it constitutes an 'embedded conditionality' in the sense that it can be triggered after an agreement to arbitrate has been established.\"67\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 30.\n\n124.\n\nCroatia further contends that the Claimants \"confuse the irrevocable nature of a Party's consent to arbitration with the limits of that consent,\"68 arguing that because its consent to arbitration has always been subject to the requirement of compatibility with the EU *acquis* as per Article 11(2) of the BIT, this consent no longer existed as of 1 July 2013, when Croatia acceded to the EU. Croatia therefore insists that \"vitiation [of consent] has never been the issue.\"69 In the words of Croatia's counsel at the Hearing:\n\n*As I have submitted previously, the scope of Austria and Croatia's mutual offers in the BIT of ICSID Arbitration were explicitly limited by agreement to circumstances where ICSID Arbitration, under the BIT, was compatible with the EU acquis. Thus, from the moment that Croatia acceded to the EU on 1 July 2013, ICSID Arbitration, by an Austria*[n] *investor against Croatia under the BIT, and a Croatian investor against Austria under the BIT, was no longer compatible with the EU acquis, and, therefore, no irrevocable consent to ICSID Arbitration could have been created or could have existed under the BIT.*70\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 46.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 46-48.\n\nTr. Day 1, 60:9-20 (Volterra).\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants assert that there is little difference between impermissible revocation or withdrawal of consent to arbitration, on the one hand, and Croatia's assertion that a purported condition can be triggered by post-consent events, on the other hand. The Claimants reject the Respondent's attempt to characterize Article 11(2) as somehow being a \"condition precedent\" to consent.71 According to Raiffeisen, \"[t]he critical element in both contexts is that once consent is perfected, it cannot subsequently be altered or negated.\"72 RBI and RBHR add:\n\n*The implication of Croatia's position is that any decision or award by the Tribunal would eternally be susceptible to challenge. Croatia could arguably even claim restitution of any moneys paid pursuant to a pecuniary obligation under a final award, if at some undetermined point its \"conditional\" consent may retroactively no longer amount to consent. This would be an absurd result that completely undermines notions of legal certainty.*73\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 184-186, 189.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 138; Claimants' Rejoinder, para 80.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 83.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that, ultimately, their interpretation of Article 11(2) is the only interpretation that is consistent with: first, the irrevocable consent extended by Croatia in Article 9 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; second, the treaty interpretation principle of effectiveness, and; third, the object and purpose of the BIT to promote and protect investment through protection of legal certainty.74 It is also the only interpretation, the Claimants say, that \"recognizes the changing content of EU law, rather than freezing the content of the *acquis* as it stood on the date the [BIT] entered into force \u2013 while at the same time safeguarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction once the proceedings have been initiated and consent has been crystallized.\"75\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 89-96. *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 200 *et seq*.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 210.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Preliminary Observations**\n--------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Parties have presented the Tribunal with the difficult task of interpreting Articles 9 and 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT to determine jurisdiction, with related consideration of the ICSID Convention and the EU Treaties in the wake of the high-profile *Achmea* Judgment. As found above, neither side carries the burden of proof. It falls squarely on the Tribunal to apply the international law rules and principles of treaty interpretation to assess whether or not it has jurisdiction.\n\n128.\n\nThere can be no question of the Tribunal's power to determine its own jurisdiction pursuant to Article 9 of the BIT and Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention. Where jurisdiction is found, the Tribunal has not only the right but also the affirmative responsibility to exercise that jurisdiction. It follows that the Tribunal has the power and responsibility to interpret Article 11(2) of the BIT, which is at the very core of the jurisdictional dispute.\n\n129.\n\nIn so doing, the Tribunal underscores that it has carefully considered the exhaustive written and oral submissions of the Parties and their legal experts on the myriad of issues the Parties have chosen to present in this arbitration. In this Decision, the Tribunal addresses what it considers to be the necessary dispositive issues. The absence of an explicit discussion of a particular issue does not mean that the Tribunal did not give that issue due consideration.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal has benefitted in particular from the Parties' observations on the *UniCredit* and *Addiko* Decisions, and from those decisions themselves, but without compromising its responsibility to interpret Article 11(2) of the BIT independently.\n\n**(2) Article 11(2) as a Conflict Clause**\n------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Article 11(2) is a *lex specialis* conflict clause. It is undisputed that the Article 11(2) text is unique and does not appear in the ECT or in the other intra-EU BITs underlying the series of jurisdiction decisions cited by the Parties.76 To date, only the *UniCredit* and *Addiko* ICSID tribunals have interpreted Article 11(2), both holding in favor of jurisdiction.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras 1, 15.\n\n132.\n\nIn light of this finding, the Tribunal need not address the Parties' extensive arguments based on the residual conflict rules in Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT and on the application of the primacy of the EU Treaties to resolve conflicts. The conflict rule applicable in this case is Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\n133.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal also need not decide the vigorously disputed issue of whether interpretation of treaty incompatibility under Article 30 of the VCLT requires a finding that the relevant two treaties have the same subject matter.\n\n**(3) The Meaning of \"incompatible\" under Article 11(2) of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nAs noted, the Parties effectively agree that the test of incompatibility is whether the obligations in the two treaties are such that compliance with one obligation would put a state in non-compliance with another.77 The Tribunal adopts this test and applies it below in its analysis of incompatibility under Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 48; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 18-19; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 39; Tr. Day 1, 72:17-20 (Volterra).\n\n135.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties disagree as to whether the proper application of Article 11(2) includes a threshold requirement, namely that the treaties to be compared have the same subject matter. Regardless of whether such a requirement exists under Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants' argument that the same prerequisite would apply in the context of Article 11(2) of the BIT. That position is not supported by the text of Article 11(2); unlike Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT, it contains no reference to treaties \"relating to the same subject-matter.\"\n\n**(4) The Import of \"in force at any given time\"**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAt this juncture, the text of Article 11(2) of the BIT merits repeating:\n\n*The Contracting Parties are not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it is incompatible with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.*78\n\nBIT (C-4), Article 11.\n\n137.\n\nIn broad brush, Article 11(2) is a negotiated conflict clause reflecting the agreement of Austria and Croatia that the EU Treaties will prevail over the BIT. The consequence of any incompatibility between the treaties is that Austria and Croatia will not be bound by the incompatible provisions in the BIT.\n\n138.\n\nThere is one express qualification to this EU law primacy, however. This is the temporal qualification: incompatibility of the BIT is tested against the EU *acquis* \"in force at any given time.\"\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's assertion that the phrase \"in force at any given time\" is a \"commonly used phrase\" used by Austria and Croatia \"*ex abundanti cautela* to ensure the broadest possible application of the EU *acquis*.\"79 Croatia offers no support for this assertion, and the Tribunal is not aware that the phrase is commonly used in treaties.\n\nRespondent's Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, para 19.\n\n140.\n\nRegardless, the Tribunal finds it helpful to break down this temporal clause into two parts for interpretation: first, the words describing the EU *acquis* as \"at any given time\" and, second, the immediately preceding two words \"in force.\"\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, whether looking to ordinary meaning in context under Article 31 of the VCLT or to the critical date doctrine under international law, the words \"at any given time\" cannot reasonably mean \"at any time whatsoever.\" The words \"at any given time\" must refer to the specific point in time that is relevant to the issue in dispute. The issue in dispute here is the Tribunal's jurisdiction or, more accurately, whether the Parties have effectively and irrevocably consented to ICSID arbitration for purposes of Article 9 of the BIT, the ICSID arbitration provision.\n\n142.\n\nThe Parties agree, and it is trite law, that a state's standing future consent to arbitration in a BIT is perfected upon the investor's effective initiation of an arbitration. Pursuant to Rule 6 of the ICSID Institution Rules, an ICSID arbitration is \"deemed to have been instituted\" under the ICSID Convention on the date the Secretary-General registers the request for arbitration.\n\n143.\n\nIn the present case, Croatia provided its standing future consent to ICSID arbitration as of 1 November 1999, the date the Austria-Croatia BIT entered into force. RBI and RBHR consented to ICSID arbitration and engaged Croatia's consent on 15 September 2017, the date the ICSID Secretary-General registered their Request for Arbitration. Accordingly, as recognized by the Parties, the critical date against which to measure jurisdiction for purposes of Article 9 of the BIT is 15 September 2017.80\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 195; Respondent's Memorial, para 93 note 103; Respondent's Reply, para 52; Tr. Day 1, 119:6-10 (Coop).\n\n144.\n\nThe interpretive inquiry does not stop here. The text in Article 11(2) of the BIT goes beyond a reference to the EU *acquis* \"at any given time.\" The full operative phrase in Article 11(2) covers the *acquis* \"**in force** at any given time\" (emphasis added). In the face of this full operative phrase \"**in force** at any given time,\" the Tribunal finds the critical interpretive question to be whether Article 9 of the BIT was incompatible with the EU *acquis* **in force** as at the ICSID registration date of 15 September 2017.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal pauses to address the assertion in the Introduction to the Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief:\n\n*Article 11(2) means what it says: neither Austria nor the Respondent is bound by anything in the BIT insofar as it is incompatible with the EU acquis. Nothing more; nothing less.*81\n\nThis assertion is not correct. There **is** more in Article 11(2) \u2013 the temporal qualification. Article 11(2) says that neither Austria nor Croatia is bound by BIT provisions that are incompatible with the EU acquis \"**in force at any given time**.\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 2.\n\n146.\n\nThe temporal qualification requires interpretation, along with the rest of the text of Article 11(2). In this regard, the Tribunal finds persuasive the *Addiko* tribunal's interpretation of the temporal phrase, that \"the latter point about a 'given time' qualifies the former point about the scope of the relevant *acquis* (that it be the *acquis* then 'in force').\"82 In their Observations on *UniCredit* and *Addiko*, the Claimants note that the *Addiko* tribunal \"underscored the distinction between the actual wording of Article 11(2) and the interpretation that might result \"if the phrase 'at any given time' were to qualify the reference to incompatibility, rather than the reference to the *acquis*,\" in this way:\n\n*The question in that case might be whether the acquis, as it has **evolved in toto** by the date of the Tribunal's assessment, compels a finding of incompatibility such as to release the Parties from obligations otherwise imposed by the BIT. By contrast, under the **actual** placement of the phrase \"at any given time\" (referring to \"the legal acquis \u2026 **in force at any given time**\"), the temporal inquiry must be into the state of the acquis itself (i.e., what elements were or were not in force as part of the acquis, as of a particular date).*83\n\n*Addiko* Decision (CLM-250)*,* para 215.\n\nClaimants' Observations on *UniCredit* and *Addiko*, para 7, citing *Addiko* Decision (CLM-250), para 215 (emphasis in original).\n\n147.\n\nReturning to the touchstone of the VCLT, the Tribunal finds that Raiffeisen's interpretation is consistent with the words \"in force at any given time\" used in Article 11(2), when read \"in their context and in the light of [the treaty's] object and purpose.\"84 The object and purpose of the BIT is the promotion and protection of investments of parties such as Raiffeisen made in the territory of Croatia.85 In the words of Raiffeisen, \"[c]reating and maintaining legal certainty is part of what it means to promote and protect investment.\"86 The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's charge that the Claimants have made \"a generic incantation\" of such principles to \"create consent where none has ever crystallized.\"87 Croatia's interpretation of Article 11(2) is patently inconsistent with the fundamental international law principles of legal certainty and good faith. Although the EU *acquis*, like all bodies of law, must and does evolve over time, it is critically important for those subjected to the law, to be able to know the law in force at any given time. This is particularly the case for purposes of fixing jurisdiction for resolution of compliance disputes.\n\nVCLT (CLM-129), Article 31(3).\n\nBIT (C-4), Preamble.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 214.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 12.\n\n148.\n\nFinally, in similar vein, the Tribunal cannot accept Croatia's position, repeated at the Hearing, that compatibility with the *acquis* under Article 11(2) is a condition precedent or precondition to Croatia's consent to arbitration under Article 9.88 As stated by the tribunal in *UniCredit* :\n\n*Article 9 can be reconciled fully with Article 11 if the \"at any given time\" language of Article 11 means that incompatibility with the EU acquis is measured for purposes of Article 9 at the time the request for arbitration is submitted and the State's consent becomes operative.* \u2026 *The Tribunal therefore concludes that the only conditionality that Article 11(2) of the BIT could bring to bear on Article 9 would be if, at the time a claim is submitted, there is demonstrated inconsistency between the irrevocable offer made by the Respondent for arbitration and the EU acquis by virtue of decisions or conduct that has occurred prior to that date.*89\n\nTr. Day 1, 53:7-10 (Volterra); Tr. Day 1, 63:3-15 (Volterra); Tr. Day 3, 667:1-3 (Volterra); Tr. Day 3, 669:19-22 (Volterra).\n\n*UniCredit* Decision (CLM-210), paras 120, 124.\n\n149.\n\nCroatia's argument is also inconsistent with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides: \"When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" As the tribunal in *Ampal v. Egypt* rightly concluded:\n\n*Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is very clear. The jurisdiction of the Centre is to be assessed at the time that jurisdiction is invoked, which is when the investor's Request for Arbitration is registered by the Centre. When jurisdiction has crystallized, \"no Party may withdraw its consent unilaterally,\" says plainly Article 25(1).*\n\n*As the Egypt-US Treaty and its Protocol must be read in the light of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal finds that there cannot be an embedded conditionality in the Treaty which could be triggered after the submission of the dispute to arbitration.*90\n\n*Ampal-American Israel Corp. and others v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 February 2016 (***Ampal v. Egypt***) (CLM-179), paras 168-169.\n\n150.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the analysis of incompatibility under Article 11(2) must take into account the EU *acquis* as it was **in force** as at the ICSID registration date of 15 September 2017.\n\n**VII. WHETHER ARTICLE 9 OF THE BIT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ARTICLES 276 AND 344 OF THE TFEU**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) The** ***Achmea*** **Judgment and its Effect**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Whether the Achmea Judgment is Binding in this Proceeding***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the CJEU in its *Achmea* Judgment decided that for EU Member States to create courts or tribunals insulated from the EU legal regime and review by the CJEU is violative of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU. Croatia relies specifically on the CJEU's holding that:\n\n*Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the* [Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT]*, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.*91\n\n*Achmea* Judgment (RLM-31), para 62.\n\n152.\n\nNoting the agreement of the Parties' legal experts\u2014Professor Craig for the Respondent and Sir Francis for the Claimants\u2014that CJEU judgments conclusively and bindingly interpret the EU Treaties and the other norms of the EU *acquis*, the Respondent contends that this agreement \"should suffice for the Tribunal to conclude that Article 9 of the BIT does not bind the Respondent and consequently to decline jurisdiction.\"92\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 66-67.\n\n153.\n\nCroatia describes this arbitration as the realization of the CJEU's fears concerning the risks that intra-EU BITs pose to the autonomy of the EU legal order:\n\n*First, there is the risk that an arbitral tribunal established under intra-EU BITs may misinterpret an EU Member State's obligations under the EU Treaties and render a binding award that is incompatible with the respondent State's international legal obligations under the EU Treaties. Second, there is the risk that the case law of such tribunals may snowball into a body of perceived authority on the international legal obligations under the EU Treaties that is used to contravene even the binding interpretations of the CJEU itself.*93\n\nCroatia accordingly urges the Tribunal to disregard the intra-EU BIT tribunal decisions cited by Raiffeisen and to abide by the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment instead.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 78\n\n154.\n\nIn contrast, the Claimants urge the Tribunal to exercise its power and responsibility to be the judge of its own jurisdiction by interpreting the instruments creating this jurisdiction.94 They rely on Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that a tribunal \"shall be the judge of its own competence.\"95\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 159-160; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 36-37.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 36.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to Raiffeisen, the CJEU interprets the EU *acquis* for internal EU purposes, not for international tribunals in extraneous proceedings not governed by the EU or its institutions. In sum, for the further reason that the CJEU has not determined the compatibility of the Austria-Croatia BIT with the EU Treaties, the Claimants take the position that the Tribunal owes no deference to the positions taken by the CJEU or the EC.96\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 104.\n\n156.\n\nIn its *Amicus Curiae* Brief, the EC accepts that this Tribunal has competence to rule on its own jurisdiction, including \"to analyse possible obstacles to the validity of the offer to arbitrate, and the existence and validity of consent to arbitrate.\"97 The EC goes on to argue that the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment is an authoritative interpretation of EU law which binds the Tribunal in this intra-EU arbitration. Under the \"broad scope of application\" of the *Achmea* Judgment, Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU \"preclude any intra-EU investment arbitration\"98 and, as a \"legal consequence,\" the offers of Croatia and Austria \"to enter into investment arbitration [are] no longer valid since the accession of Croatia to the European Union \u2026 on 1 July 2013.\"99\n\nEC *Amicus* Brief, para 14.\n\nEC *Amicus* Brief, Section 1 (emphasis in original).\n\nEC *Amicus* Brief, para 3.\n\n157.\n\nAgain, the Claimants disagree. Even if the *Achmea* Judgment were to have binding effect, say the Claimants, the paucity of the reasoning leaves the *Achmea* Judgment unpersuasive and would justify the Tribunal's adopting a narrow interpretation of the Judgment.100 RBI and RBHR describe the *Achmea* Judgment as\n\n*remarkably terse and superficial in its reasoning and does not engage in any reasoned, detailed analysis of important countervailing principles of EU law (such as legal certainty, proportionality, or the protection of existing and fundamental rights). Further, it all but ignores the much more comprehensive and careful reasoning of the Advocate General, who reached the opposite conclusion.*101\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 125; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 170-172.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 105.\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize the interpretive inconsistencies they perceive in the *Achmea* Judgment. The CJEU rejected the analysis in Advocate General Wathelet's opinion (the ***Achmea Wathelet Opinion***) that: (a) Article 344 of the TFEU only applies to disputes between EU Member States, and not between private parties and a Member State; and (b) Article 267 of the TFEU, which provides for preliminary references on questions of EU law from EU national courts to the CJEU, cannot be read to prohibit submission of a dispute to a court or tribunal to which that provision does not apply, meaning courts or tribunals that are not EU national courts. However, if the CJEU's rejection of this analysis by Advocate General Wathelet is correct, then the *Achmea* Judgment should equally prohibit submission of disputes by EU Member States to any forum other than EU national courts; yet the CJEU has expressly allowed intra-EU commercial arbitration. Additionally, the CJEU did not distinguish intra-EU investment arbitration from extra-EU investment arbitration or court proceedings, all of which could equally potentially raise questions of EU law.102\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 155-157.\n\n159.\n\nIn response, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants' \"subjective and unfounded criticism of the *Achmea* Judgment as 'terse and superficial in its reasoning' demonstrates their lack of understanding of longstanding CJEU case law and the principles of the EU *acquis* that underpin the relevant provisions of the EU Treaties.\"103 Croatia insists that the *Achmea* Judgment is by definition binding:\n\n*Whether or not the Claimants find the Achmea Judgment convincing is irrelevant. The interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU by the CJEU is binding on both Contracting Parties to the BIT as a matter of public international law.*104\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 64.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 72.\n\n***b. The Scope of Application of the Achmea Judgment***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Parties also disagree as to the scope of application of the *Achmea* Judgment, including whether it applies to ICSID arbitration.\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that \"[i]t is evident that the decision of the ECJ [in *Achmea*] applies to all investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs. Its ruling [is] in no way qualified or limited.\"105\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 78.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants consider this position to rest on \"unjustifiably broad readings\" of the *Achmea* Judgment.106 They put substantial emphasis on the fact that the CJEU in the *dispositif* of the Judgment specifically referred to\n\n*a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, **such as** Article 8 of the* [BIT]*, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.*107\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 161; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 65, 100, 109-110.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 162, citing *Achmea* Judgment (RLM-31) (emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants recount that the German *Bundesgerichtshof* framed the original inquiry to the CJEU to be whether \"Article 344 TFEU preclude[s] the application of a provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT),\" but the CJEU itself added the qualifying term \"such as\" in its Judgment.108 In other words, according to Raiffeisen, the CJEU chose to narrow the scope of the Judgment from one concerning the arbitration clause in any intra-EU BIT to one concerning the arbitration clause in an intra-EU BIT \"such as\" Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, which includes a choice of EU law clause. The Claimants differentiate the Austria-Croatia BIT:\n\n*The Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT affirmatively mandated the application of the EU Treaties and EU law to investor-State disputes. The Austria-Croatia BIT, in contrast, contains no such provision. Instead, the parties have chosen the specialized regime of the BIT itself and other rules of international law to govern their investment disputes. At most, EU law will have to be considered as a factual predicate, which according to the CJEU itself does not create any incompatibility.*109\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 119-124; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 101-105.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 9, 95.\n\n164.\n\nTherefore, argue the Claimants, the *Achmea* Judgment should be applied only to other arbitration clauses that have the same characteristics as Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, most importantly an express EU choice of law provision.110 The Claimants emphasize that the Austria-Croatia BIT does not contain such an applicable law provision:\n\n*Instead, the Austria-Croatia BIT prescribes a special body of international law rules applicable to investment disputes, and limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 9 of the* [BIT] *to the resolution of those disputes pursuant to the terms of the Treaty. The Austria-Croatia BIT therefore neither requires, nor indeed permits, application of national law to resolve investment disputes; rather, such disputes are to be resolved exclusively by reference to the Austria-Croatia BIT's international standards regarding expropriation, fair and equitable treatment and discrimination.*111\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 123.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 124.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants see no relevance to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, which is a default choice of law rule triggered if the parties have not chosen the law applicable to their dispute. Here, say the Claimants, the Parties have made that choice by virtue of the BIT's self-contained international regime, which has no choice-of-law provision like Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT. Although RBI and RBHR admit that investor-state tribunals may need to consider the content of national or EU law as a matter of fact, this is not the same as applying EU law as the governing law of the dispute.112\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 149-156; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 142.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants urge the Tribunal to consider the reasoning of the *Eskosol v. Italy* tribunal, which, as described by Raiffeisen, accepted that applying EU law \"as an accessory relevant not in its own right but only as a predicate question, analogous to a factual finding, for the application of international law standards\" is consistent with Article 344 of the TFEU.113 The *Eskosol* tribunal referred to the Opinion of the Council Legal Services in the CJEU case *Commission v. Ireland* :\n\n[I]*t is not sufficient, in order to establish a breach of Article 344 TFEU, that an arbitration tribunal takes account of EU law as a criterion for interpreting a provision **not forming part of EU law**. There could be an infringement of Article 344 TFEU only if the subject-matter of the decision of the arbitration tribunal were the interpretation and application of provisions of EU law themselves.*114\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 142, 162, citing *Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Italy's Request for Immediate Termination and Italy's Jurisdictional Objection Based on Inapplicability of the Energy Charter Treaty to Intra-EU Disputes, 7 May 2019 (***Eskosol v. Italy***) (CLM-192), para 123.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 131 and Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 162, citing *Eskosol v. Italy* (CLM-192), para 123 (emphasis in original).\n\n167.\n\nAt the end of the day, say the Claimants, they make their claims under the international standards of protection in the Austria-Croatia BIT, and not under EU law:\n\n*Although the Tribunal may need to consider the Croatian courts' deficiencies in applying Croatian consumer protection law, which incorporates EU law in certain respects, to decide the Claimants' fair and equitable treatment claim, any such consideration of EU law would be as a matter of fact.*115\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 157.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent strongly disagrees with Raiffeisen's arguments on several fronts. First, as conceded by Raiffeisen's legal expert Sir Francis at the Hearing, the CJEU often uses the phrase \"such as\" in the *dispositifs* of its judgments.116 Second, the CJEU expressly set out specific criteria of what is precluded in its *dispositif* in the *Achmea* Judgment:\n\n*Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the* [Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT]*, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept*117.\n\nAccordingly, says Croatia, it would be \"entirely illogical\" to assume that the CJEU meant to include by implication all the characteristics of Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, including irrelevant criteria such as the number of arbitrators, and the Claimants \"have failed to give any remotely plausible reason why the CJEU, having explicitly included multiple essential characteristics of general application\" in the *dispositif*, should be understood to have done so.118\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 101, citing Tr. Day 2, 484:12-16 (Sir Francis).\n\nRespondent's Memorial, citing *Achmea* Judgment (RLM-31), page 11 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras 102-103.\n\n169.\n\nThus, says Croatia, the only logical reading is that the CJEU referred to Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT in the *dispositif* as merely an example of a provision possessing the relevant treaty characteristics.119 As a matter of grammar, the use of commas to demarcate the relative clause \"such as Article 8 of the [Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT]\" further shows the scope of the CJEU's ruling in *Achmea*; the clause does not a limit or narrow that scope.120\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 104.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 104. *See also* Respondent's Reply, paras 99-100.\n\n170.\n\nThird, as for the choice of law clause in the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT in *Achmea*, Croatia posits that the relevant question is not \"whether a specific tribunal must *in concreto* interpret or apply EU law in the particular dispute before it,\" but rather whether the underlying arbitration clause is compatible with the EU *acquis whether, in abstracto, there is a possibility that a tribunal established under that same BIT \"may\" be allowed, or required, to interpret or apply points of EU law. If so, then the arbitration clause in that BIT is incompatible with the EU acquis, in particular with \u2013 at the very least \u2013 Articles 276 and 344 of the TFEU and with the principles of the autonomy of the EU legal order and mutual trust.*121\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 79.\n\n171.\n\nFourth, in any event, the Respondent argues that Article 42 of the ICSID Convention operates to include EU law as the applicable law of ICSID disputes, thereby making this arbitration similar to the *Achmea* Arbitration, in which Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT stipulated application of the state party's domestic law and EU law.\n\n172.\n\nFinally, even if the words \"such as\" were to be interpreted as limiting application of the *Achmea* Judgment only to intra-EU BITs with the same characteristics as the BIT before the CJEU, Croatia argues that Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT \"mirrors exactly\" the language in Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT.122\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras 106-107.\n\n173.\n\nTurning to ICSID arbitration in particular, RBI and RBHR argue that the ICSID system is more akin to the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (the ***CETA***), a mechanism which the CJEU (following the Opinion of Advocate General Bot123) distinguished from that involved in the *Achmea* Arbitration and held to be compatible with EU law in Opinion 1/17 (the ***CETA Opinion***).124 According to Raiffeisen, as with the CETA mechanism, this Tribunal is to \"assess the content of EU law only insofar as necessary to determine a question of international investment law \u2013 but not for the purposes of determining or regulating EU law as such.\"125 Further, \"like the CETA investment court, this Tribunal will only assess EU law, like a fact, in order to determine if a substantive standard under the BIT or customary international law was breached.\"126\n\nOpinion of Advocate General Bot dated 29 January 2019, ECLI:EU:C:2019:72 (FJ-35).\n\nOpinion 1/17 of the Court dated 30 April 2019, ECLI:EU:C:2019:341 (the ***CETA Opinion***) (FJ-36); Jacobs Opinion, paras 32-37; Claimants' Rejoinder, para 133; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 97, 158-160, 168.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 130\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 160.\n\n174.\n\nRBI and RBHR go on to describe allegedly material differences between ICSID arbitration and the bilateral *ad hoc* UNCITRAL arbitration in the *Achmea* Arbitration, which, as recognized by the *OperaFund v. Spain* tribunal, militate against applying the *Achmea* Judgment to ICSID arbitration.127 According to Raiffeisen, when a state participates in ICSID arbitration proceedings pursuant to a BIT, the state is complying with its obligations under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Failure to comply would undermine the ICSID Convention by allowing state parties effectively to withdraw their irrevocable consent to arbitration under Article 25 \"in the absence of an authoritative determination under general international law of the BIT's status.\"128 The Claimants urge the Tribunal not to presume that the CJEU intended in its *Achmea* Judgment to place EU Member States in violation of their obligations under the ICSID Convention and international law, especially as the EU Treaties themselves: (a) require the EU to contribute to the strict observance and development of international law, and (b) stipulate that rights and obligations arising under treaties with third states are not to be affected by provisions of the EU Treaties.129 The Claimants conclude that the *Achmea* Judgment cannot be read to extend to ICSID arbitrations.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 134, citing *OperaFund Eco-Invest SICAV PLC and Schwab Holding AG v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/36, Award, 6 September 2019 (CLM-233), paras 383-387.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 135-136.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 168-174; Claimants' Rejoinder, paras 134-140; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 117-122.\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent takes a different view. In response to the Claimants' CETA argument, Croatia argues that the CETA Opinion is inapposite because it interprets an agreement between the EU itself and non-EU Member States. Moreover, \"CETA expressly precludes challenges to general legislation enacted for the purpose of social and consumer protection \u2013 the very claims brought in *Addiko* and in the present case.\"130\n\nRespondent's Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, para 17.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent charges the Claimants with seeking \"to create a false equivalence between tribunals under this BIT and the CETA Tribunal in an attempt to establish that the CJEU retreated from its position in the *Achmea* Judgment \u2026.\"131 Croatia argues that Raiffeisen cannot credibly group together ICSID tribunals and the CETA Tribunal and then distinguish them from the *Achmea* tribunal on grounds that they merely \"assess the content of EU law\" only as a matter of fact:\n\n*The untenable nature of the Claimants' position is demonstrated once more by its internal contradictions. It is impossible for any tribunal established under Article 9 of the BIT to \"assess the content of EU law\" as a mere fact while being free to disregard CJEU case law, an essential part of EU law, at any rate without giving rise to precisely the risk of a failure to apply or misapplication of EU law which is incompatible with the EU acquis.*132\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 139.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 141.\n\n177.\n\nGoing beyond Raiffeisen's CETA argument, Croatia pursues a different line of argument to show that the reasoning in the *Achmea* Judgment applies beyond intra-EU UNCITRAL arbitrations to intra-EU ICSID arbitrations. Croatia states that the CJEU's primary concern was the effect of intra-EU investment arbitration on the autonomy of the EU legal order and on the mutual trust and cooperation among Member States, which are protected by the referral mechanism that allows EU national courts to refer questions of EU law to the CJEU\n\nfor binding determination. The ICSID system, which, unlike the UNCITRAL regime, is subject to no supervision by national courts at all, risks splintering EU law by allowing tribunals to apply their own interpretations of EU law without any potential reference to the CJEU, thus threatening the autonomy of the EU legal order.133 As for mutual trust and sincere cooperation, the CJEU found in the *Achmea* Judgment that this requires trust between Member States in their respective national legal systems, as well as ensuring that the CJEU referral mechanism is not jeopardized by carve-outs of certain dispute categories from the national courts and thus from the CJEU. Intra-EU ICSID arbitration is such a carve-out, and hence violates the EU principles of mutual trust and sincere cooperation.134\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 101-102.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 103-105.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent contends that even Advocate General Wathelet, on whose Opinion the Claimants rely, rejected the use of ICSID arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs as incompatible with the EU Treaties.135 Croatia states that the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion, in paragraphs 252-253, \"contrasts UNCITRAL arbitration with ICSID arbitration and rejects the latter as incompatible since it lacks any possibility of review by the national courts of the EU Member States.\"136\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 126.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 175, citing *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion (CLM-177), paras 252-253.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants reject this contention, charging Croatia with quoting misleadingly from the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion. The words attributed to the Advocate General actually were from a section in his Opinion in which he was setting out the EC's position. According to RBI and RBHR, paragraphs 252-253 of the Opinion are inconclusive because Advocate General Wathelet did not specifically address ICSID arbitration, and his Opinion is supportive overall of all forms of investor-state arbitration.137\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 141-144.\n\n***c. The Temporal Application of the Achmea Judgment***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the *Achmea* Judgment applies retroactively and even on whether the concept of retroactivity applies.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent bases its position on the allegedly settled law that CJEU interpretations of the EU *acquis* have an *ab initio* effect, clarifying and defining where necessary \"the meaning and scope of that rule as it must be or ought to have been understood and applied from the time of its coming into force\" and consequently affecting even legal relationships that arose before the specific judgment ruling on the request for interpretation.138 According to Croatia, rather than raising a question of retroactive application, this means that Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT has been incompatible with the EU *acquis* since the date of Croatia's accession to the EU on 1 July 2013. This is especially so, because the \"*ab initio* or *ex tunc* effect of the CJEU's interpretation is itself a principle of the EU *acquis* and thus equally integrated into the BIT through Article 11(2) of the BIT.\"139\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 87-88, citing *Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v. Denkavit Italiana S.r.l.*, CJEU Case 61/79, Judgment, 27 March 1980 (CLM-132), para 16 and *\u00c1ngel Barreira P\u00e9rez v. Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social (INSS) and Tesorer\u00eda General de la Seguridad Social (TGSS)*, CJEU Case C-347/00, Judgment, 3 October 2002 (RLM-84), para 44. *See also* Craig Opinion, paras 62-63.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 88.\n\n182.\n\nIn essence, Croatia argues that the *Achmea* Judgment did not change the EU *acquis* to render it incompatible with intra-EU BITs retroactively; the *Achmea* Judgment merely clarified and confirmed the effect of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU,140 thereby providing the Tribunal with the benefit of \"an authentic interpretation of the TFEU in the specific context of intra-EU BITs.\"141 In other words, the EU *acquis* has always been incompatible with intra-EU BITs, and\n\n*the legal basis for this latter incompatibility is not the Achmea Judgment as such but Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU. The Achmea Judgment, like any exercise in statutory interpretation, merely clarified the already existing obligations under these provisions in the specific context of intra-EU investment treaties.*142\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 50.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 55.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 60.\n\n183.\n\nCroatia explains that the CJEU exceptionally may expressly limit the *ex tunc* effects of its preliminary rulings on past transactions in the interests of legal certainty. However, such limitations \"will *always* be laid down *in the ruling itself*,\"143 and the CJEU included no such limitation in the *Achmea* Judgment.144\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 90, citing A. Dashwood et al., *Wyatt and Dashwood's European Union Law* (6th ed., 2011) (excerpts) (RLM-117), page 229 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 91.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants' position is that, even accepting an *ex tunc* principle in EU law, the principle should not apply to the *Achmea* Judgment. As explained by the Claimants' legal expert Sir Francis, the CJEU typically limits the *ex tunc* effect of its rulings to extend the protection afforded by the EU Treaties to individuals against Member States, and so it would make little sense not to limit the *ex tunc* effect of the *Achmea* Judgment, which does not protect individuals but instead deprives individual investors of the protections afforded by BITs.145 Further, the *ex tunc* effect of CJEU judgments must be balanced against other principles of EU law, including the principles of legal certainty, proportionality and the protection of fundamental rights. Sir Francis describes *Achmea* as a case where \"the general principles of EU law \u2026 would be furthered by limiting the temporal effects of the judgment, rather than applying it *ex tunc*.\"146\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 189-190, citing Jacobs Opinion, paras 57-60; Claimants' Rejoinder, para 167, citing Jacobs Opinion, para 65 and Second Jacobs Opinion, paras 8, 11.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 193-194, citing, *inter alia*, Jacobs Opinion, para 61.\n\n185.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants acknowledge that the investor in the *Achmea* Arbitration did not comply with the EU First Occasion Rule, which requires a party to request non-retroactivity of a judgment the first time the CJEU considers the relevant issue. This is not surprising, say the Claimants, because First Occasion Rule requests are typically made by EU Member States to limit the economic impact of CJEU judgments by barring historical claims. In comparison, a private party such as the *Achmea* investor would not anticipate, post-judgment, being made a defendant in similar claims.147 Given this different situation, application of the First Occasion Rule would not further the principle of legal certainty.148\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 191.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 193.\n\n186.\n\nDespite the *ex tunc* nomenclature, the Claimants contend that Croatia is effectively arguing\u2014without convincing support\u2014for retroactive application of the *Achmea* Judgment in violation of international law principles, in particular the critical date doctrine. According to Raiffeisen:\n\n*It is an elementary principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction is determined by reference to the law in force at the date on which proceedings are instituted \u2013 the \"critical date\" \u2013 and that, once established, it is unaffected by subsequent events.*149\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 177.\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the critical date doctrine must trump any applicable *ex tunc* effect for the *Achmea* Judgment under EU or international law.150 In support, they cite the *UniCredit* Decision:\n\n*Even if there is ex tunc application of an EU judgment by virtue of a subsequent interpretation, that application is by virtue of a subsequent event \u2013 the time of the EU judgment.*151\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 184.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 187, citing *UniCredit* Decision (CLM-210), para 123.\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimants present two policy reasons underlying the critical date rule. First, it would be unacceptable for jurisdiction to cease to exist as the result of a subsequent event, because this would cause an unwarranted difference in the treatment of applications depending on the speed with which courts are able to examine the cases brought before them. Second, a respondent could deliberately place itself beyond a court's jurisdiction by bringing about an event resulting in non-fulfilment of jurisdictional requirements, for example, by denouncing a treaty.152\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 178, citing *Application of the Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 18 November 2008, [2008] ICJ 412 (CLM-136), para 80. *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 248.\n\n189.\n\nIn the instant case, the Claimants identify the critical date for jurisdiction to be 15 September 2017, when the ICSID Secretary-General registered Raiffeisen's Request for Arbitration. Croatia's consent to arbitration under Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT was perfected on that date. As the CJEU did not issue the *Achmea* Judgment until 6 March 2018, that Judgment had no effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.153\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 181.\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent accuses the Claimants of misrepresenting the critical date doctrine. Croatia asserts that \"the relevant test for the purposes of the critical date doctrine is whether the post-critical date acts by a party to the dispute are the 'normal continuation of prior acts' and are not undertaken to improve a party's position in an ongoing dispute,\" and denies that it took any unilateral acts contrived to defeat the Tribunal's jurisdiction.154 Indeed, says Croatia, it obviously could not have manipulated the CJEU, an independent judicial body that does not take instructions from the EU, let alone one EU Member State, into deciding the *Achmea* case in its favor.155\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 137-138, citing *Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia)*, Judgment, 17 December 2002, [2002] ICJ 625 (RLM-121), para 135.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 149-151.\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimants respond that the critical date doctrine is not limited to unilateral acts by a respondent, citing the ICJ decisions in the *Arrest Warrant* and *Lockerbie* cases.156 They also disagree with Croatia's assertion that the Singapore Court of Appeal, in the case of *Sanum Investments v. Laos*, recognized a spectrum of interpretations of the critical date doctrine.157 The Claimants describe that decision as adopting the same understanding of the critical date doctrine that they advocate here: evidence post-dating the institution of proceedings is incapable of affecting a court or tribunal's jurisdiction, as determined at the date on which proceedings are instituted.158\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 195, citing *Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000* (*Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic*, [2016] SGCA 57, Judgment, 29 September 2016 (***Sanum Investments v. Laos***) (CLM-208).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 194-197\n\n192.\n\nCroatia objects further to the Claimants' interpretation of the critical date doctrine on grounds that \"[t]he Claimants can no more ask the Tribunal to disregard the *Achmea* Judgment merely because it postdates the commencement of this case any more than the Respondent can ask the Tribunal to ignore the *UniCredit* Decision merely because it was rendered last year.\"159 In response, RBI and RBHR clarify that they \"rely on decisions subsequent to the *Achmea* judgment, including the decision in *UniCredit*, not as 'subsequent events' capable of affecting jurisdiction but as authorities on the effects, or absence thereof, of the subsequent event itself, i.e., the CJEU's judgment in *Achmea*.\"160\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 144.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 170.\n\n193.\n\nSeparately, the Claimants charge the Respondent with seeking a retroactive invalidation of its irrevocable consent to arbitrate. In response, Croatia reiterates its argument that no \"irrevocable\" arbitration agreement between Croatia and Raiffeisen could have come into existence.161 Rather, upon Croatia's accession to the EU on 1 July 2013, Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT (by then, between two EU Member States) took effect to limit Croatia's consent to arbitrate to the extent of incompatibility with the EU *acquis*, specifically the substantive treatment standards and the Article 9 arbitration clause.162 According to Croatia, Article 11(2)\n\n*has always made it expressly clear that the BIT did not bind the Contracting Parties to anything contained therein* \u2026 *to the extent that it was incompatible with the EU acquis in force at any given time. Since the BIT is incompatible with the EU acquis, which has been in force between the Contracting Parties to the BIT from the moment when Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013, both the investor-State arbitration clause and the substantive treatment provisions of the BIT have since this date been incompatible with the EU acquis.*163\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 59, 83-87.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 59-60; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 63.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 47.\n\n194.\n\nTo the extent the Claimants rely on the fact that the *Achmea* Judgment followed registration of the Request for Arbitration with ICSID on 15 September 2017, Croatia notes that the *Achmea* case was pending with the CJEU before the registration date.164 The Claimants consider that fact of little significance, because \"if *Achmea* were to have any import, the only legally relevant point in time is when the Court rendered judgment in that case.\"165\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 53.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 168.\n\n**(2) Incompatibility with Articles 276 and 344 of the TFEU**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nCroatia's position is that \"the BIT has been incompatible with the EU *acquis* since 1 July 2013, the date when the EU *acquis* entered into force for the Respondent and the BIT became an intra-EU BIT.\"166 The incompatibility is that, as decided in the *Achmea* Judgment, Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, respectively, preclude EU Member States from contracting out of the CJEU preliminary reference procedure and the exclusive CJEU competence within the EU legal order, as Austria and Croatia have done in the BIT.167 With its *Achmea* Judgment in March 2018, says Croatia, the CJEU \"divined, clarified and confirmed the law as it stood at the critical date.\"168\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 30.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras 59-60.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 56.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the EU *acquis* \u2014as in force in 2017\u2014recognized any incompatibility between intra-EU BITs and EU law. They rely on the *Bundesgerichtshof* 's 2016 *Achmea* preliminary reference to the CJEU and the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion, both of which considered intra-EU BITs to be compatible with EU law.169 In response to criticism from Croatia, RBI and RBHR clarify that their argument is not that the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion was itself part of the *acquis* at the critical date, but that it is \"a persuasive and well-reasoned analysis of the *acquis* as it stood on 15 September 2017.\"170\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 169.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 59.\n\n197.\n\nThe Parties offer different views as to whether Austria and Croatia considered the BIT to be incompatible with the EU *acquis* when Croatia acceded to the EU in 2013. Croatia, for its part, relies on a *note verbale* sent to Austria in 2011, in anticipation of accession, in which Croatia expressly raised the issue of denouncing the BIT as part of its obligation to bring its treaties into full alignment with the EU *acquis*.171\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 162-164, citing *Note Verbale* of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and European Integration of the Republic of Croatia to the Embassy of the Republic of Austria in Zagreb, No. 1594/11, dated 28 March 2011 (R-26). *See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras 120-121.\n\n198.\n\nFor the Claimants, however, the exchange of *notes verbales* shows merely that Croatia requested Austria's views on termination of the BIT and Austria did not agree to termination.172 Furthermore, other treaties signed in the run-up to Croatia's accession and, most importantly, the accession treaty itself, indicated no concerns regarding the compatibility of Croatia's intra-EU BITs with EU law. The 2011 EU-Croatia Treaty of Accession obliged Croatia to \"withdraw from any free trade agreements with third countries, including the Central European Free Trade Agreement as amended,\" but did not impose any similar obligations regarding intra-EU BITs.173 The Claimants emphasize that the 2005 Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, on the other part (the ***Association Agreement***), which was concluded as part of Croatia's early candidacy for EU membership, affirmatively encouraged Croatia to enter into BITs with EU Member States as a means of establishing a favorable climate for private investment.174 This demonstrates, says Raiffeisen, that the parties to the Association Agreement did not consider intra-EU BITs to be incompatible with the *acquis*, but rather \"an element that would help prepare Croatia for its accession to the EU.\"175 Finally, RBI and RBHR note that both Croatia and Austria continue to affirm that the BIT remains in force.176\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 62-65, citing, *inter alia*, Record of consultations held with Austrian representatives on 13 September 2011in the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship (R-27). *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 51-52.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 59-61, citing, *inter alia*, Act Concerning the Conditions of Accession, appended to the Treaty of Accession (OJ L 112, 24/04/2012) (RLM-32), Article 6(9).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 45-47, citing Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, on the other part, concluded in Luxembourg on 29 October 2001, entered into force on 1 February 2005 (OJ L 26, 28/01/2002) (the ***Association Agreement***) (CLM-218).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 47.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 27; Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para 61.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent rejects Raiffeisen's reliance on the Association Agreement on grounds that Article 85 of the Agreement does not address potential compatibility of intra-EU BITs with the EU *acquis*. Instead, says Croatia, the EU's encouragement to Croatia to enter into investment treaties with EU Member States \"in no way implies that such investment treaties would remain compatible with the EU *acquis* once they had become intra-EU BITs.\"177 Croatia highlights the concession of Raiffeisen's legal expert Sir Francis that there were \"no precise assurances\" of compatibility and that Article 85 of the Association Agreement only \"comes very close to an assurance.\"178\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 116.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 118, citing Tr. Day 2, 517:18\u2013518:5 (Sir Francis).\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants put particular emphasis on a 14 February 2018 meeting, called by Croatia in connection with Article 11(3) of the BIT, which calls for a dialogue to discuss \"uncertainties concerning the effects of [Article 11(2)].\" The Minutes of that meeting record what the Claimants describe as Austria's unequivocal views on the compatibility \u2013 before the *Achmea* Judgment \u2013 of the BIT and EU law:\n\n*Austria reiterate*[s] *its previously expressed position that it considers BITs valid and that it does not deem them incompatible with EU law. Austria follows this position diligently also in the infringement proceedings brought against it by the European Commission. Austria considers that BITs fulfil their function and give additional assurances to investors. Austria points out that even DG FISMA admits that BITs provide useful additional protection [for investors].*\n\n*Austria interprets Article 11(2) of the Agreement in* [a \u2013 sic] *way that incompatibility with the EU law only affects such individual provisions. Still Austria contends incompatibility with the EU law should be determined by the CJEU, even in case of individual provisions. In any event, individual provisions' incompatibility should not result in the whole BIT invalidity. Further, incompatibly should have effect as of the time when it is established, that is without retroactive effect.*\n\n*Austria considers that arbitral tribunals could lack competence should the CJEU decide that the dispute resolution provision is incompatible with the EU law. If so, Austria considers that such decision would not change the dispute resolution provision and would have no impact on the pending proceedings.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Austria and Croatia concluded this meeting by stating once the CJEU decides on the Achmea dispute further steps may be discussed.*179\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 203, 215 citing Minutes of the meeting with the Austrian representatives regarding the interpretation of Article 11 paragraph 2 and 3 of the Agreement on the promotion and protection of investment concluded with Austria (English translation from Croatian) (the ***February 2018 Minutes***) (C-243).\n\n**(3) The 15 January 2019 Declaration and the 29 May 2020 Termination Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn their submissions before the Hearing and their Post-Hearing Briefs, the Parties addressed the import of the 15 January 2019 Declaration. They subsequently added observations on the related 29 May 2020 Termination Treaty (discussed below).\n\n***a. The 15 January 2019 Declaration***\n----------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the 15 January 2019 Declaration, signed by all 28 EU Member States, confirms that Article 9 of the BIT is incompatible with the EU *acquis*, on the basis of the text:\n\n[A]*ll investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable* \u2026 *An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty.*180\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 36-37, citing Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (the ***15 January 2019 Declaration***) (RLM-60), page 1.\n\n203.\n\nCroatia then asserts that the Declaration is part of the EU *acquis* as one of the \"declarations and resolutions adopted by the Union\" and, by virtue of Article 11(2) of the BIT, the Tribunal is bound to apply it.181 Additionally, Croatia describes the 15 January 2019 Declaration as the result of a dialogue between Austria and Croatia as per Article 11(3) of the BIT, which clarifies any uncertainty arising from the effects of Article 11(2) and should be respected by the Tribunal.182 Croatia also argues that the Declaration constitutes a subsequent agreement between Austria and Croatia as to the authoritative and binding interpretation of both the TFEU and the BIT, as per Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 46-47.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 49-50.\n\n204.\n\nRaiffeisen's first argument in response, as a procedural matter, is that the Tribunal should draw adverse inferences on the issue of the 15 January 2019 Declaration based on Croatia's refusal to comply with the Tribunal's order to produce the documents listed in its Privilege Log.183 The Claimants contend that these documents, all of which appear to relate to the Declaration, could have been relevant to show differing positions among EU Member States on the issue of the incompatibility of intra-EU investment treaty arbitration with EU law. Or, say the Claimants, the documents could have evidenced EC pressure on the Member States to induce them to sign the Declaration, which would be relevant to rebut Croatia's claim that nothing prevented the EU Member States that originally argued for compatibility from refusing to sign the Declaration or qualifying their signatures.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 175-181; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 263-267.\n\n205.\n\nRBI and RBHR offer several responses to Croatia's substantive arguments on the import of the 15 January 2019 Declaration. First, they argue that\u2014as found by the *Addiko* and *UniCredit* tribunals and agreed by the Respondent's legal expert, Professor Craig\u2014the Declaration is not part of the EU *acquis*, because it was not adopted by the European Union itself and instead is described as \"Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States.\"184\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 261, citing Tr. Day 2, 417:21\u2013418:7 (Craig); Claimants' Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, para 29; Craig Opinion, para 160(a).\n\n206.\n\nSecond, the Declaration cannot be deemed to be an authoritative interpretation of EU law, because only the CJEU is empowered to interpret the EU Treaties. In the opinion of Raiffeisen's legal expert, Sir Francis:\n\n*Moreover, even if the Member States could be taken to represent the EU for these purposes, they would not have the power to issue any authoritative interpretation of the EU Treaties or to alter or extend the meaning of a judgment of the CJEU. The CJEU is the supreme authority within the EU with regard to the interpretation of the Treaties, and its interpretations are authoritative and binding on the Member States and the EU institutions.*185\n\nJacobs Opinion, para 75. *See also* Claimants' Rejoinder, para 183; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 269.\n\n207.\n\nThird, the Declaration cannot evidence an EU level dialogue between Austria and Croatia concerning interpretation of Article 11(2) of the BIT for purposes of Article 11(3) of the BIT, as the Declaration makes no reference to the BIT.186 In this connection, the Claimants emphasize that the EU has threatened infringement proceedings against any Member State unwilling to make a public commitment in favor of terminating intra-EU BITs by signing the Declaration, thereby bringing into question whether the Declaration can be considered the result of a \"dialogue.\"187 Finally, in similar vein, the Claimants argue that the Declaration is not relevant to a treaty interpretation exercise under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT, given that it is not an agreement regarding interpretation of the Austria-Croatia BIT and the provisions of the BIT.188\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 186; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, paras 272-273.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 204.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 184-185; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 271.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimants also charge Croatia with misapplying the Singapore Court of Appeal Judgment in *Sanum Investments v. Laos* in connection with its argument that the 15 January 2019 Declaration supports retroactive modification of the BIT.189 In that case, the Singapore Court of Appeal refused to allow Laos to modify the geographical scope of the application of the Laos-China BIT retroactively by producing *notes verbales* with China that post-dated commencement of the arbitration.190 In comparison\u2014and, according to Raiffeisen, wrongly\u2014Croatia characterizes the Declaration as a \"normal continuation of diplomatic relations between the EU Member States\" that was not undertaken to improve its position in the instant case and, indeed, Croatia could not have prevailed upon the other 27 Member State to sign the Declaration to improve its position in the instant case.191\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 276.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 189, citing *Sanum Investments v. Laos* (CLM-208), para 104.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 138.\n\n***b. The 29 May 2020 Termination Treaty***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nIn its Observations on the Termination Treaty, the Respondent takes the position that, despite Austria's not being a signatory, the May 2020 Termination Treaty confirms the \"consensus view of all EU Member States\" that Article 9(2) of the BIT has been incompatible with the EU *acquis* since Croatia acceded to the EU on 1 July 2013.192 Croatia contends that the Preamble of the Termination Treaty makes this \"abundantly clear\" in providing as follows:\n\n*Investor-State arbitration clauses in bilateral investment treaties between the Member States of the European Union (intra-EU bilateral investment treaties) are contrary to the EU Treaties and, as a result of this incompatibility, cannot be applied after the date on which the last of the parties to an intra-EU bilateral investment treaty became a Member State of the European Union.*193\n\nRespondent's Observations on the Termination Treaty, paras 2, 11.\n\nAgreement for the Termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties between Member States of the European Union dated 29 May 2020 (the ***Termination Treaty***) (RLM-173).\n\n210.\n\nWith the same concept incorporated in Article 4 of the Termination Treaty, Croatia contends that the Treaty \"reflects the same consensus view of all EU Member States\" as to incompatibility in the 15 January 2019 Declaration, which Austria signed.194 Austria cannot resile from this earlier position, says Croatia, by refusing to sign the Termination Treaty. To meet Raiffeisen's objection on this point, Croatia offers clarification, for the avoidance of doubt, that it is not submitting that the Termination Treaty \"creates direct legal effects for Austria as a non-party, in the sense of the Termination Treaty itself serving as the source of new obligations or rights for Austria.\"195\n\nRespondent's Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 7.\n\nRespondent's Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 10.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the alleged fact that, when declining to sign the Termination Treaty, Austria simultaneously affirmed its intention to implement the *Achmea* Judgment and terminate its intra-EU BITs.196 In support of this allegation, Croatia refers to ongoing bilateral discussions with Austria reported in \"diplomatic documents that the Respondent is constrained from disclosing as a matter of international law.\"197\n\nRespondent's Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 16.\n\nRespondent's Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 17.\n\n212.\n\nIn sharp contrast, in their Observations on the Termination Treaty, the Claimants note Austria's specific decision not to become a party and assert that the Termination Treaty \"is therefore entirely irrelevant for the status of the [Austria-Croatia BIT] and immaterial to the Respondent's preliminary objections to jurisdiction.\"198 In support of this position, RBI and RBHR rely on Articles 34 and 35 of the VCLT, which reflect the \"fundamental principle of international law\" that a treaty does not create obligations for a third state without its consent and express acceptance of treaty obligations in writing.199\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 3.\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 5.\n\n213.\n\nEven if the Termination Treaty did reflect a near-consensus view of the EU Member States, RBI and RBHR contend that the Treaty would still not form part of the EU *acquis*. This is because, without Austria, Ireland, Sweden and Finland as signatories, the Termination Treaty \"is consequently not an international agreement 'concluded ***by the Union***' or '***by the member states among themselves***' within the sphere of the Union's activities' so as to form part of the *acquis* within the EU's own definition of that term.\"200\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 10, citing EC, \"European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations: Glossary\" (C-239) (emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\n214.\n\nRBI and RBHR deny that Austria's signature of the 15 January 2019 Declaration has any relevance, because that signature \"does not change the fact that Austria specifically chose not to become a party to the Termination Treaty, which is a separate legal instrument concluded well over a year later.\"201\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 11.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, the Claimants charge that Croatia's attempt to rely on asserted bilateral Croatia-Austria discussions \"\u2013 while failing to substantiate their content or even their existence \u2013 is particularly disingenuous in light of its past refusal to produce documents related to 'discussions among EU Member States' on these issues in breach of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 6.\"202 Even if there were such bilateral discussions, the Claimants contend that they would not circumvent the VCLT Article 34 principle that treaties do not create obligations or rights for third states without their consent. Moreover, by operation of the critical date doctrine, even if Austria and Croatia were to agree to terminate the BIT and even to terminate the sunset provision in Article 12(3), such termination \"would not, according to fundamental principles of international law and adjudication, in any way affect this Tribunal's jurisdiction or the Claimants' rights under the [BIT].\"203\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 13.\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 17.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION BY MAJORITY**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThis section contains the views of the majority of the Tribunal, formed by Arbitrators Reed and Alexandrov. Arbitrator Tomov's dissenting views appear in Section VII.C below.\n\n217.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Parties' extensive submissions, the Tribunal sets out in this section its analysis of whether the ICSID arbitration clause in Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT is incompatible with the EU *acquis* in force on 15 September 2017. The Tribunal begins with the necessary temporal inquiry into the state of the EU *acquis* on that date and the central question of what role, if any, the *Achmea* Judgment plays.\n\n218.\n\nThis inquiry does not, in the Tribunal's view, require interpretation or application of the *acquis*. Instead, it requires the Tribunal to take account of the relevant *acquis*, as a necessary component of the comparative analysis mandated in Article 11(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal likens its role, in this respect, to that of the anticipated CETA Tribunal, which was vetted as compliant with Article 344 of the TFEU in the CETA Opinion relied upon by Raiffeisen. In the words of that Opinion:\n\n*[T]he CETA Tribunal, when it is called upon to examine the compliance with the CETA of the measure that is challenged by an investor and that has been adopted by the investment host State or by the Union, will inevitably have to undertake, on the basis of the information and arguments presented to it by that investor and by that State or by the Union, an examination of the effect of that measure. **That examination may, on occasion, require that the domestic law of the respondent Party be taken into account.** However, as is stated unequivocally in Article 8.31.2 of the CETA, **that examination cannot be classified as equivalent to an interpretation, by the CETA Tribunal, of that domestic law**, **but consists, on the contrary, of that domestic law being taken into account as a matter of fact**, while that Tribunal is, in that regard, obliged to follow the prevailing interpretation given to that domestic law by the courts or authorities of that Party, and those courts and those authorities are not, it may be added, bound by the meaning given to their domestic law by that Tribunal.*204\n\nCETA Opinion (FJ-36), para 131 (emphasis added).\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to underscore specifically its understanding of its role vis-\u00e0-vis the CJEU and the *Achmea* Judgment. There is no doubt, and the Parties do not dispute, that EU law creates a legal order with special characteristics. This is recognized in the *Achmea* Judgment itself:\n\n*[T]he autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States themselves.*205\n\n*Achmea* Judgment (RLM-31), para 33.\n\n220.\n\nThe CJEU operates on the level of the EU legal order, and its judgments are binding within the bounds of that order. In contrast, international arbitration tribunals constituted under investment treaties operate on the level of the international legal order. Investor-state tribunals have confirmed this principle many times over, for example, in *Electrabel v. Hungary* and *RREEF v. Spain*.206 This Tribunal operates on the plane of the international legal order, with authority from the instruments pursuant to which it was constituted, specifically the Austria-Croatia BIT and the ICSID Convention. In assessing questions of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal is bound to apply those instruments in accordance with international law.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015 (***Electrabel v. Hungary***) (CLM-68), para 4,112;\u00a0 *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2016 (***RREEF v. Spain***) (CLM-157), para 75.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal will need to assess the effect of the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment for the purpose of Article 11(2) of the BIT. This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal must defer or should defer\u2014or even responsibly could defer\u2014to the *Achmea* Judgment as to the interpretation or application of the BIT. Just as this Tribunal is not empowered to issue authoritative interpretations of EU law, which properly lies within the legal prerogative of the CJEU, the CJEU is not empowered to issue authoritative interpretations of provisions in the Austria-Croatia BIT, whether directly or indirectly.\n\n**(1) The EU** ***Acquis*** **on 15 September 2017 and the Effect of the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nTo set the stage, it is helpful to review the scope of the EU *acquis communautaire*. The Parties agree that the *acquis* includes, among other things: (a) the content, principles and political objectives of the TEU and TFEU; (b) legislation adopted by the EU in application of the EU Treaties; (c) the case law of the CJEU; (d) declarations and resolutions adopted by the EU; and (e) international agreements concluded by the EU that are binding on it and on its Member States.207 The Parties also agree that opinions of the CJEU Advocates General are part of the *acquis*, unless and until they are rejected by the CJEU or otherwise found incompatible with primary elements of the *acquis* including the EU Treaties.208\n\nEC, \"European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations: Glossary\" (C-239); EUR-Lex, Glossary \u2013 Acquis (R-14), available at: http://eur-lex.europa.cu/summary/glossary/acquis.html.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 53; Second Craig Opinion, para 51.\n\n223.\n\nThe Parties further agree that the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment has formed part of the EU *acquis* at least since 6 March 2018 when it was rendered. However, as summarized above, the Parties disagree with respect to the retroactive effect, as per the Claimants, or the *ex tunc* effect, as per the Respondent, of the *Achmea* Judgment before 6 March 2018.\n\n224.\n\nIn summary, RBI and RBHR rely on the critical date doctrine in international law to argue that the *Achmea* Judgment did not become part of the *acquis* until after the Parties' consent to arbitration was perfected by ICSID registration of their Request for Arbitration on 15 September 2017. Thereafter, that consent became irrevocable under the ICSID Convention and so the *Achmea* Judgment can have no effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n225.\n\nIn contrast, Croatia's position is that the CJEU in its judgments declares the content of EU law by way of authoritative interpretation as to how EU law was always meant to be understood, with *ex tunc* effect. To put the argument in two steps for this proceeding: first, the 6 March 2018 *Achmea* Judgment obviously was not part of the *acquis* as of 15 September 2017; but, second, the CJEU's interpretation has legal effect *ex tunc* as of 15 September 2017 and, as relevant to this case, back to July 2013 when Croatia acceded to the EU and the EU legal order.\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal finds dispositive the first step in Croatia's argument, namely the acknowledgement that the *Achmea* Judgment was not part of the *acquis* as of 15 September 2017. Put simply, the then-future *Achmea* Judgment could not have been **in force** within the meaning of Article 11(2) of the BIT as of 15 September 2017.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal fully understands the second step in Croatia's argument\u2014that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU were part of the *acquis* in force on 15 September 2017, as was the principle that CJEU interpretations of the EU Treaties have *ex tunc* effect, and so the CJEU's interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 in *Achmea* must be effective on that date. The Tribunal readily accepts that a CJEU interpretation of the EU Treaties forms part of the *acquis* once formally rendered, but that interpretation\u2014even assuming that it has the *ex tunc* effect under EU law that Croatia ascribes to the *Achmea* Judgment\u2014cannot be **in force** before it is rendered and comes into existence. An interpretation by the CJEU cannot be **in force** with binding effect on unknowing parties. Neither states nor investors can fairly be expected to guess what definitive interpretations of EU law may come from the CJEU in the future.\n\n228.\n\nHere, it is important to recall that the Claimants commenced this arbitration on 15 September 2017 based on the express statement in Article 9(2) of the BIT that Croatia had \"irrevocably consent[ed] in advance\" to ICSID arbitration. At that point, even with the public debate that preceded the *Achmea* Judgment on 6 March 2018, no one could say which way that judgment would go. As discussed in detail below, the record reflects that, at that given time, neither Austria nor Croatia understood Article 9 of the BIT to be definitively incompatible with the *acquis*. Nor did Advocate General Wathelet. Nor did the EU institutions responsible for the 2005 Association Agreement and the 2013 Treaty of Accession. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds persuasive the analysis of the *Addiko* tribunal:\n\n[T]*he BIT must be read as a whole, including not only its Article 11(2) reference to the acquis \"in force at any given time\" (which recognizes that the acquis evolves and that the state of the acquis at a particular critical date is important), but also its Article 9 commitment to the irrevocability of Austria and Croatia's advance offer of consent to arbitrate. Both of these provisions moreover must be read in light of the general principles of international law which are inherently part of the applicable law of the BIT. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to accept that, whatever EU law may provide regarding the ex tunc or ex nunc effect of the Achmea Judgment, Article 11(2) of the BIT mandates that this judgment be applied to international effect contrary to the basic propositions of both Article 9 of the same BIT and the generally accepted principles* [in Articles 46 and 69] *of the VCLT* *regarding good faith reliance on treaty validity prior to the invocation of invalidity, so long as the grounds for invalidity were not already manifest at the time of such reliance.*209\n\n*Addiko* Decision (CLM-250), para 279 (footnotes omitted). The Tribunal discusses Article 46 of the VCLT further in Section VII.B(3).\n\n229.\n\nCroatia may wish to avoid pleading \"retroactive application\" of the *Achmea* Judgment, but the Claimants are correct in stating that \"Croatia effectively requests the Tribunal to apply the purported *acquis* as it stands now [post- *Achmea* Judgment], with the benefit of hindsight.\"210 Irrespective of whether the *Achmea* Judgment has an *ex tunc* effect under EU law, Croatia's approach must be rejected based on the text of Article 11(2) of the BIT, read together with Article 9(2) and as a matter of international law.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 11.\n\n230.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the *Achmea* Judgment, which post-dates the registration of the Claimants' Request for Arbitration, cannot factor into the analysis of incompatibility under Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\n231.\n\nIn light of this finding, the Tribunal need not address the Parties' arguments concerning the binding nature of the *Achmea* Judgment itself in this proceeding, whether the *Achmea* Judgment applies to ICSID arbitration, or whether the CJEU's determinations covering BIT provisions \"such as\" Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT apply to different choice of law provisions (or lack thereof).\n\n**(2) Incompatibility with Articles 276 and 344 of the TFEU**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nOn Croatia's case, the *Achmea* Judgment *per se* is not necessary to prove that Article 9 of the BIT was already incompatible with Articles 276 and 344 of the TFEU upon Croatia's accession to the EU in 2013 and, therefore as at 15 September 2017, leaving Croatia unable validly to consent to ICSID (or UNCITRAL) arbitration with Raiffeisen. The Tribunal now turns to this question of inherent incompatibility under Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\n233.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties agree that the test for incompatibility is whether the obligations in the two treaties are such that compliance with one obligation would put a state in non-compliance with another. Applied in the present case, the question is whether Croatia, by consenting to ICSID arbitration of investment disputes with investors of Austria, was in non-compliance with Articles 276 and 344 of the EU *acquis* in force on 15 September 2017.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the relevant state of the EU *acquis* in force on that date is clear from the record of this arbitration.\n\n235.\n\nMost notably, in the long run-up to Croatia's accession to the EU, the 2005 Association Agreement unequivocally encouraged Croatia to expand its BITs with EU Member States. The text of Article 85 of that Agreement, entitled \"Investment promotion and protection,\" merits quoting:\n\n*1. Cooperation between the Parties shall be aimed at establishing a favourable climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign.*\n\n*2. The particular aim of cooperation shall be:*\n\n*\u2014 for Croatia to improve a legal framework which favours and protects investment;*\n\n*\u2014 the **conclusion, where appropriate, with Member States of bilateral agreements for the promotion and protection of investment** ;*\n\n*\u2014 the improvement of investment protection.*211\n\nThis encouragement necessarily covered the full scope of investment treaties, including international arbitration clauses as well as substantive protections.\n\nAssociation Agreement (CLM-218), Article 85 (emphasis added).\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this requirement, a treaty obligation imposed by the EU and its then-Member States on Croatia in 2005, carries substantial weight in applying Article 11(2) of the BIT. The purpose of the Association Agreement was to provide a transition period, during which Croatia had to adopt and implement the EU *acquis*. The EU Member States, at that time, evidently understood expansion of BITs with EU Member States to be part of Croatia's adoption and implementation of the *acquis*. The Tribunal cannot accept Croatia's argument that, in effect, Croatia should have understood that any BITs it entered into with EU Member States with the encouragement of the Association Agreement would immediately become incompatible with the *acquis* upon Croatia's successful accession in 2013. As Sir Francis testified at the Hearing, Article 85 \"comes very close to an assurance\" of compatibility.212\n\nTr. Day 2, 519:16-18 (Sir Francis).\n\n237.\n\nIn addition, although the subsequent 2013 Treaty of Accession is silent on the point of intra-EU BITs, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Respondent that silence signifies an about-face on the compatibility of BITs and the *acquis* at the time. By definition, the EU had by 2013 accepted that Croatia had adopted and implemented the *acquis* (subject to negotiated grace periods in certain fields) and hence further encouragement to enter into BITs with EU Member States was no longer necessary. Furthermore, the Treaty of Accession expressly required Croatia to withdraw from certain treaties, but not from the BITs that would become intra-EU BITs on accession.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the conclusion to be inescapable that intra-EU BITs, including their arbitration provisions, were reasonably understood in (at least) September 2017 to be compatible with the *acquis*, as would be the 1999 Austria-Croatia BIT once Croatia acceded to the EU in 2013 and the BIT became an intra-EU BIT. With this background, the Tribunal cannot accept that Croatia was in breach of the EU *acquis* on 15 September 2017 as a consequence of the Claimants' accepting its standing consent to arbitrate in Article 9 of the BIT. Thus, there was no incompatibility within the meaning of Article 11(2) on that date.\n\n239.\n\nThe record contains no support for a different conclusion. To the contrary, as late as February 2018, it was clear that Austria and Croatia did not agree that the BIT was incompatible with the *acquis* then in force. At a meeting on 14 February 2018 called by Croatia to discuss \"multiple ambiguities\" concerning Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT, Austria expressed the view that the BIT was compatible with the *acquis* as at the time.213 As emphasized by Raiffeisen, the Meeting Minutes unambiguously record Austria's position that \"it considers BITs valid and that it does not deem them incompatible with the EU law,\" and should the CJEU find intra-EU treaty arbitration incompatible with EU law, \"such decision would not change the dispute resolution provision and would have no impact on the pending proceedings.\"214\n\nFebruary 2018 Minutes (C-243).\n\nFebruary 2018 Minutes (C-243).\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it significant that Austria expressed these views with full knowledge that the CJEU judgment in *Achmea* \u2014whichever way it might go on the compatibility question\u2014was imminent. The Tribunal also finds it significant that the context for these views was a meeting called by Croatia expressly in connection with Article 11(3) of the BIT. To recall, Article 11(3) provides:\n\n*In case of uncertainties concerning the effects of paragraph 2 of this Article the Contracting Parties will enter a dialogue.*215\n\nBIT (C-4), Article 11.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it apparent, from the Minutes of the 14 February 2018 bilateral meeting, that Austria perceived no \"uncertainties\" to be resolved, at least before the CJEU rendered the *Achmea* Judgment. Further, for Austria's part, if the CJEU were to find incompatibility in *Achmea*, that finding would apply only prospectively and not affect existing proceedings, such as this arbitration. Even assuming that Croatia's views\u2014which are not recorded\u2014were directly contrary, the Minutes do not reflect any agreement by the Croatian and Austrian representatives that arbitration under Article 9 of the BIT was incompatible with the EU *acquis* then in force, for purposes of triggering Article 11(2) of the BIT.\n\n242.\n\nAlthough the Minutes recorded that after the CJEU's *Achmea* decision \"further steps may be discussed,\" the Tribunal finds no evidence in the record of such further bilateral discussions having taken place. Instead, there is strong evidence that Austria maintained its views and, although a signatory to the 15 January 2019 Declaration, ultimately declined in May 2020 to support the Termination Treaty and terminate the Austria-Croatia BIT.\n\n243.\n\nAnother indicator of the *acquis* in force at the critical date of 15 September 2017 is the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion itself, issued only four days later on 19 September 2017. The opinion of Advocate General Wathelet was that intra-EU BITs were compatible with EU law, as also suggested in the preliminary reference from the German *Bundesgerichtshof* to the CJEU that prompted the CJEU *Achmea* case. The Tribunal agrees with Raiffeisen that the Opinion is a persuasive analysis of the *acquis* as it stood in September 2017, although the CJEU in the *Achmea* Judgment in March 2018 made contrary rulings on compatibility that now form part of the *acquis*.\n\n244.\n\nIn sum, in applying Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT, the Tribunal finds that Article 9 of the BIT was not incompatible with TFEU Articles 276 and 344 of the EU *acquis* **in force** as at 15 September 2017, when ICSID registered the Claimants' Request for Arbitration. Absent such incompatibility, Croatia's standing consent to arbitrate in the 1999 BIT was valid and binding, and the Claimants' acceptance of that offer perfected the consent required by the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(3) Article 46 of the VCLT**\n------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for its conclusion in the principle set forth in Article 46 of the VCLT, which provides:\n\n*1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.*\n\n*2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.*216\n\nVCLT (CLM-129), Article 46.\n\n246.\n\nThe general rule in Article 46 applies to the issue of binding consent to arbitration under Article 9 of the BIT. Insofar as Croatia argues that, due to inherent incompatibility with the *acquis* and operation of Article 11(2), it was never bound by Article 9, any such incompatibility certainly was not \"manifest\" or \"objectively evident.\"\n\n247.\n\nThat any incompatibility between the *acquis* and arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs was anything but \"manifest\" or \"objectively evident\" is apparent from the broader context and evolution of views on the issue. Prior to the *Achmea* Judgment, the compatibility question was the subject of considerable debate. The position of the EC itself evolved substantially. At the initial stages of EU enlargement in Central and Eastern Europe, the purported incompatibility between intra-EU treaty arbitration clauses and EU law was not raised and, instead, Croatia and other countries were led to expand their intra-EU BITs. Subsequently, the EC directed Member States to take steps to terminate intra-EU BITs on their own terms, without any suggestion that those treaties were subject to automatic cessation or termination. It was only later that the EC took the position that intra-EU BITs had already ceased to apply on grounds of incompatibility with EU law, a position to which Advocate General Wathelet did not ascribe.\n\n248.\n\nViewed in the round, the Tribunal considers that the evolution in the EC's position and the contrary *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion, as well as the views expressed by Austria on the eve of the CJEU's *Achmea* decision, are a perfect illustration that, up until the *Achmea* Judgment, the question of the compatibility of intra-EU treaty arbitration clauses with EU law was, at a minimum, an open, complex and disputed question on the plane of EU law. Accordingly, to recall the wording of Article 46 of the VCLT, it could not have been \"objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and good faith\" that the CJEU would ultimately come down on the side of incompatibility.\n\n**(4) The 15 January 2019 Declaration and the 29 May 2020 Termination Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nOne issue remaining is the import of the subsequent events of the 15 January 2019 Declaration and the 29 May 2020 Termination Treaty.\n\n250.\n\nIn the 15 January 2019 Declaration, 22 EU Member States\u2014including Austria and Croatia\u2014joined the statement that\n\n*all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable* \u2026 *An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty.*217\n\n15 January 2019 Declaration (RLM-60), page 1.\n\n251.\n\nIn light of its interpretation of Article 11(2) of the BIT, the Declaration does not change the Tribunal's conclusion that it has jurisdiction under Article 9. The Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent's panoply of arguments based on the Declaration. First, the Parties' legal experts agree that the Declaration, which was not adopted by the EU itself but by certain Member States, is not a part of the *acquis*.218 The Tribunal notes the EC's definition of the *acquis* as including \"declarations and resolutions adopted by the Union.\"219 Second, even if it were, the Declaration was not part of the *acquis* in force in September 2017 when Croatia consented to arbitration, and so is irrelevant to demonstrate incompatibility for purposes of Article 11(2) of the BIT. Third, insofar as Croatia describes the Declaration as an authoritative interpretation of Articles 267 and 334 of the TFEU with effect in September 2017, only the CJEU is empowered to issue such an interpretation and, in any event, the title itself identifies the Declaration as a statement on the \"legal consequences\" of the *Achmea* Judgment. Fourth, that Austria and Croatia signed the Declaration cannot transform the multilateral process leading to the Declaration into either, first, a bilateral dialogue under Article 11(3) of the BIT concerning \"uncertainties concerning the effects of\" Article 11(2)\u00a0 or, second, a \"subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the [BIT] treaty or the application of its provisions\" for purposes of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.\n\nJacobs Opinion, para 74; Tr. Day 2, 417:21\u2013418:7 (Schwarz, Craig).\n\nEC, \"European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations: Glossary\" (C-239).\n\n252.\n\nNor does the 29 May 2020 Termination Treaty change the Tribunal's conclusion that it has jurisdiction. The Termination Treaty, at least when in force, certainly does form part of the EU *acquis*. The Tribunal recognizes the clarity of purpose in the Preamble: \"Investor-State arbitration clauses in [intra-EU BITs] are contrary to the EU Treaties and, as a result of this incompatibility, cannot be applied after the date on which the last of the parties\" became an EU Member State.\n\n253.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal must also recognize that Austria, despite having signed the 15 January 2019 Declaration, is not a signatory to the Termination Treaty and the Austria-Croatia BIT is not included in the Annex of terminated intra-EU BITs. Even assuming the Termination Treaty has *ex tunc* effect in the EU legal order, the Tribunal agrees with Raiffeisen that\u2014without Austria consenting to its terms\u2014the Treaty is irrelevant to this dispute, as a matter of international law under Articles 34 and 35 of the VCLT.220\n\nClaimants' Observations on the Termination Treaty, para 5.\n\n254.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's determination that neither the 15 January 2019 Declaration nor the Termination Treaty supports Croatia's Preliminary Objections, there is no need to rule on Raiffeisen's request that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from Croatia's refusal to produce EC background documents in violation of Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n**C. THE DISSENTING VIEW**\n--------------------------\n\n255.\n\nArbitrator Tomov does not agree with the conclusion of the majority of the Tribunal in Section VII.B above.\n\n256.\n\nArbitrator Tomov considers that, pursuant to Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT, Austria and Croatia have agreed that if the BIT or any part of it is incompatible with the EU *acquis* in force in any given time, they are not bound by it. The term EU *acquis* is shorthand for the EU legal system as a whole. Consequently, Austria and Croatia have agreed that incompatibility is to be determined not only by reference to the elements of the EU legal system taken separately and in isolation, but also by reference to its rules governing which court has the power to interpret authoritatively the meaning of these elements, and the temporal and personal scope of the court's decisions. In other words, in Article 11(2) of the BIT, Austria and Croatia have agreed that the rules of the EU legal system will govern the temporal effect and the relevance of the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment for assessing the content of the EU *acquis* in force on 15 September 2017, the moment in time when the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration.\n\n257.\n\nEU law, as developed in the record, does not support the exclusion of the *Achmea* Judgment. In addition, neither the critical date doctrine nor Article 46 of the VCLT mandates another interpretation of Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT or negates in full or in part the clear agreement between Austria and Croatia expressed in Article 11(2) and/or the legal consequences under EU law. The first, according to the *Nottebohm* case, has a residual nature.221 The second does not apply because, according to the ILC Fragmentation Report, in the case of incompatibility between treaties, the incompatible treaty is not invalid but simply inapplicable.222\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Lichtenstein v. Guatemala)*, Preliminary Objection, Judgment, 18 November 1953, [1953] ICJ 111 (***Nottebohm***) (CLM-202), pp 119, 121.\n\nILC Fragmentation Report (RLM-100), paras 320, 333, 340.\n\n258.\n\nEven if the *Achmea* Judgment were not considered a part of the EU *acquis* in force on 15 September 2017, the acts and documents on which the majority bases its decision\u2014the position of the EU Commission in regard to intra-EU BITs over the years, the 2005 Association Agreement, the 2013 Treaty of Accession, and the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion\u2014do not support the conclusion that, at that moment in time, the arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs were reasonably understood to be compatible with Article 267 and Article 344 of the TFEU. On the contrary, when the compatibility of Article 9 of the Austria-Croatia BIT with Article 267 and Article 344 of the TFEU is analyzed in the light of the previous decisions of the CJEU, on which the *Achmea* Judgment is based, the opposite conclusion is predictable and likely.\n\n**VIII. WHETHER THE BIT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION PROVISIONS OF THE EU** ***ACQUIS***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) Compatibility with the EU Treaties**\n------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nIn addition to its main arguments of incompatibility between Article 9 of the BIT and Articles 276 and 344 of the TFEU, on grounds of precluding the CJEU's exclusive role in the EU legal order, the Respondent contends that Article 9 and the substantive protections in the BIT are also incompatible with the EU *acquis* key principles of mutual trust and non-discrimination.223 The relevant *acquis* provisions, all indisputably in force as at 15 September 2017, are Articles 18, 49 and 63 of the TFEU. In brief, Article 18 of the TFEU prohibits \"any discrimination on the grounds of nationality;\" Article 49, \"restrictions on the freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State;\" and Article 63(1), \"all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries.\"224 Professor Craig describes these rules as \"form[ing] the cornerstone of the single market, which is the economic core of the EU.\"225\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 6.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 94, citing TFEU (RLM-30).\n\nCraig Opinion, para 9.\n\n260.\n\nIt is Croatia's position that, by providing investors from Austria and Croatia with dispute resolution and substantive protections not available to nationals of other EU Member States, Article 9 and fair and equitable treatment (***FET***) and other substantive protections in the BIT have the effect of discriminating against nationals of other EU Member States on grounds of nationality, thus disturbing the level playing field in terms of freedom of establishment and movement of capital between EU Member States.226 Such unequal treatment violates, and is not compatible with, the *acquis*.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 94-95, 100-102.\n\n261.\n\nIn their primary argument in response, RBI and RBHR describe Croatia's arguments as mere assertions, offering little basis to distinguish the long line of treaty arbitration decisions finding BIT investor-state arbitration and substantive investment provisions to be compatible with EU law.227 In support, the Claimants list some 30 decisions, starting with *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic* in March 2007 through *Watkins Holding v. Spain* in January 2020,228 including the decisions of the *Addiko* and *UniCredit* tribunals.229 Drawing on that line of cases, the Claimants insist that there is no incompatibility, because the Austria-Croatia BIT only requires that Croatia not treat investors from other EU Member States and third states **more** favorably than it treats Austrian investors; the BIT does not require Croatia to treat non-Austrian investors **less** favorably than Austrian investors.230 In what the Claimants label a \"complete response\" to the Respondent's argument, they cite Sir Francis' first Opinion:\n\n*In practice, the combined effect of the BIT and EU law is that Croatia is required to treat investors from all EU Member States as favourably as it treats investors from Austria \u2013 and therefore as favourably as it treats investors from any non-Member State. I can see nothing problematic about that. There would only be a conflict between the BIT and EU law if the BIT required Croatia to treat Austrian investors more favourably than investors from other Member States, but it does not do that.*231\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 76-78, 100-105.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 77 note 93, citing, *inter alia*, *Eastern Sugar B.V. v. Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 008/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007 (***Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic***) (CLM-143), paras 142-181; *Watkins Holding S.\u00e0.r.l. and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44, Award, 21 January 2020 (***Watkins Holding v. Spain***) (CLM-244), paras 180-226.\n\nClaimants' Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, para 30.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 80; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para 79.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 80, citing Jacobs Opinion, para 83 (emphasis in original).\n\n262.\n\nThe Respondent describes the Claimants' position as \"fail[ing] on the ordinary meaning of discrimination,\" because \"[e]xpressly granting an advantage only to one group amounts as much to discrimination as expressly depriving another group.\"232\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 181.\n\n263.\n\nRBI and RBHR retort that, even if this were so, the remedy for such discrimination would be for Croatia to extend the same treatment it provides to Austrian investors to investors from other EU Member States, citing *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic* among other decisions.233 This remedy, according to Raiffeisen, is preferable to allowing Croatia to rely on its own alleged wrong and escape substantive liability under the Austria-Croatia BIT.234\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 41, citing, *inter alia*, *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic* (CLM-143), para 170.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 42.\n\n264.\n\nCroatia describes as \"inconsequential\" the fact that the BIT does not prohibit it from extending that advantage to nationals of other EU Member States \"by means of hypothetical future treaties.\"235 In Croatia's words:\n\n*This does not detract from the indisputable fact that, in direct violation of the EU acquis, the BIT creates advantages (both procedural and in terms of substantive treatment standards) for investors of one other EU Member State that it does not extend to investors from other EU Member States. The Claimants' position merely means that extant discrimination could hypothetically be removed.*236\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 182.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 182.\n\n265.\n\nThe Parties agree there is no direct relevance to the CJEU's *Achmea* Judgment on this issue, as the Judgment is silent as to discrimination. Croatia acknowledges that \"there is no equally specific guidance on this point from the CJEU.\"237\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para 6.\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimants do rely on the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion, which, in light of the silence on discrimination in the *Achmea* Judgment, they say still stands as part of the relevant *acquis*. Although Advocate General Wathelet addresses the investor-state arbitration provision in the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT, the Claimants consider that his opinion is equally applicable to substantive protections in BITs.238 That opinion is that BITs are not incompatible with EU law on the basis of discrimination:\n\n[T]*he fact that the reciprocal rights and obligations created by the BIT apply only to investors from one of the two Contracting Member States is a consequence inherent in the bilateral nature of BITs. It follows that a non-Netherlands investor is not in the same situation as a Netherlands investor so far as an investment made in Slovakia is concerned.*\n\n\u2026\n\n[An investor-state dispute settlement] *mechanism such as that established by Article 8 of the BIT, which confers on Netherlands investors the right to have recourse to international arbitration against the Slovak Republic, does not constitute discrimination on the ground of nationality, prohibited by Article 18 TFEU.*239\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 34.\n\n*Achmea* Wathelet Opinion (CLM-177), paras 75, 82.\n\n267.\n\nAs contended by the Claimants, treaties are not discriminatory under EU law simply because they afford certain treatment only on a bilateral basis. In support, RBI and RBHR cite the CJEU double taxation treaty case of *D. v. Inspecteur van de Belastingdienst* (the ***D****Case***), which was also cited in the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion in the context of compatibility of arbitration provisions.240\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 81-86; *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion (CLM-177), paras 73-75.\n\n268.\n\nCroatia argues in response that the *D* Case is not analogous, because EU Member States have specifically retained competence over direct taxation under Article 65(1)(a) of the TFEU and therefore have leeway to conclude bilateral double taxation treaties, whereas the EU regime has competence to govern intra-EU commerce and movement of capital.241\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 186-188.\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimants do not accept this distinction. They highlight that the CJEU did not base its decision in the *D* Case on individual Member State competence in taxation,242 and Advocate General Wathelet had already rejected a similar argument made by the EC.243 RBI and RBHR further clarify that they\n\n*never suggested that it was the mere bilateral character of tax treaties that rendered them analogous for present purposes to BITs. Rather, it is the fact that the nationals of the parties to the treaty are, by virtue of the treaty, in a different situation from other EU nationals.*244\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 37.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 39.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 40.\n\n270.\n\nFinally, as with arbitration provisions in BITs, RBI and RBHR observe that many investment treaty tribunals have found that the TFEU does not contain substantive equivalents of the FET and other substantive protections in the relevant applicable BIT, leading to decisions that the two treaties are not incompatible.245\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, para 87; Claimants' Rejoinder, para 41.\n\n**(2) Compatibility with the GATS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the GATS is part of the EU *acquis*, as an international agreement concluded by the EU and entered into by the Member States among themselves within the sphere of the EU's activities.246 Consequently, incompatibility with the GATS would also constitute incompatibility with the EU *acquis*.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 103-104, 106.\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimants do not accept that the GATS is part of the EU *acquis*. In support, the Claimants cite CJEU decisions that consistently leave out the World Trade Organization (***WTO***) Agreements from the rules referred to when reviewing the legality of measures taken within the EU. The CJEU has explained that the WTO Agreements afford WTO Members significant flexibility in implementing WTO rules (for example, by allowing a Member to choose to pay compensation instead of withdrawing a WTO-inconsistent measure), a flexibility that the Claimants describe as allowing a Member to decide for itself whether even to comply with the rules or, put a different way, rendering the WTO rules \"not binding enough.\"247*A fortiori*, say the Claimants, the GATS suffers from the same implications and, like other WTO Agreements, is not considered part of the EU *acquis*.248\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 200. *See also* Claimants' Counter-Memorial, para 232.\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 226-233.\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent brushes aside Raiffeisen's argument, distinguishing the question of whether the CJEU deems the WTO Agreements to have direct effect such that they can be relied on by individuals in EU courts from the question of whether the BIT is incompatible with the EU *acquis*. Further, the CJEU has held that EU Member States that fail to adopt measures necessary to implement an international agreement concluded by the EU have breached their EU law obligations, which confirms that international agreements concluded by the EU, such as the GATS, are part of the EU *acquis*.249\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 192.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants describe as inapposite the Respondent's argument that the question of the WTO Agreements not having direct effect as distinct from the question of whether the BIT is incompatible with the EU *acquis*. After all, in order to answer the question of compatibility with the EU *acquis*, one must first identify the content of that *acquis*.\n\n275.\n\nProceeding on the basis that the GATS is part of the EU *acquis*, Croatia alleges that the Austria-Croatia BIT is incompatible with the *acquis* because it is incompatible with Article II(1) of the GATS, an anti-discrimination clause, which provides:\n\n*With respect to any measure covered by this Agreement, each Member shall accord immediately and unconditionally to services and service suppliers of any other Member treatment no less favourable than that it accords to like services and service suppliers of any other country.*250\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 107, citing General Agreement on Trade and Services (the ***GATS***) (RLM-33), Article II(1).\n\n276.\n\nCroatia identifies three relevant requirements in Article II(1) of the GATS: (a) the measure at issue must be a \"measure covered\" by the GATS; (b) the relevant services or service suppliers must be \"like;\" and (c) the WTO Member must accord \"no less favourable treatment\" to the service or service suppliers of another WTO Member.\n\n277.\n\nCroatia next contends that the BIT meets all three requirements. As to the first, given the broad definition of \"affecting trade and services\" found in WTO Appellate Body cases, the BIT qualifies as a measure affecting trade in services covered by the GATS.251 Second, as the purpose of the BIT to privilege investors supplying services with protections not available to third state investors that supply the same type of services, the requirement of \"likeness\" is met.252 As to the third requirement, given that the substantive protections in the BIT are extended only to investors of Austria and Croatia, there necessarily is less favorable treatment of investors of other WTO Members.253\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 110-112; Respondent's Reply, paras 195-196.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 113.\n\nRespondent's Memorial, para 114.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with the Respondent's arguments on the Article II(1) requirements. In particular, as to the third, RBI and RBHR reiterate that the BIT does not require Croatia to accord a certain level of treatment to investors not from Austria, and it would be fully consistent with the BIT for Croatia to accord fair and equitable treatment to investors from all other states or to treat investors from all other states no less favorably than it treats Croatian investors.254\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 239-242.\n\n279.\n\nIn further support of its position, Croatia notes that seven WTO Members have taken the express step of exempting their BITs from the GATS most-favored-nation obligations, thus implying that investment treaties do fall within the scope of Article II. Austria and Croatia not having so exempted their BIT from Article II, the BIT must be incompatible with the GATS.255\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 115-118.\n\n280.\n\nRaiffeisen's response is that adopting this argument would have \"seismic implications\" for international trade and investment, given that most GATS Members, including the United States, Japan, China and the EU itself, have not scheduled exemptions for themselves, and that WTO Members have more than 3,000 BITs in place. In any case, the exemption situation actually undermines Croatia's argument, because the effect of the exemptions is simply to reserve the right to impose domestic measures implementing international investment agreements, and not the right to enter into the investment agreements themselves.256\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 222-224.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Compatibility with the EU Treaties**\n------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Respondent's arguments that Article 9 and the substantive protections in the BIT are incompatible with the anti-discrimination provisions in Articles 18, 49 and 63 of the TFEU, as part of the *acquis* in force as at 15 September 2017.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it clear that Article 9 of the BIT operates to make ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration available to qualified Croatian and Austrian investors, without affecting the dispute resolution avenues available\u2014whether the same as, or different and perceived as more or less favorable than ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration\u2014to investors from other EU Member States.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it similarly clear that the substantive provisions of the BIT, including the FET protection provided in Article 2(1), do not require Croatia to treat Austrian investors more favorably than investors from other EU Member States. The Tribunal is persuaded by Sir Francis' opinion that \"the combined effect of the BIT and EU law is that Croatia is required to treat investors from all EU Member States as favourably as it treats investors from Austria \u2013 and therefore as favourably as it treats investors from any non-Member State,\" which is not problematic.257\n\nJacobs Opinion, para 83.\n\n284.\n\nIn coming to this conclusion on discrimination, the Tribunal aligns with the *Addiko* and *UniCredit* tribunals in noting the absence of any CJEU interpretation of the TFEU \"as barring the procedural or substantive provisions of intra-EU BITS on discrimination grounds.\"258 The CJEU in its *Achmea* Judgment did not touch on discrimination issues. It follows that, as argued by Raiffeisen, \"the only standing interpretation on the issue in the EU *acquis*\" is the *Achmea* Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, who found the procedural and substantive provisions of intra-EU BITs compatible with the non-discrimination provisions in the TFEU.259 Like the *Addiko* tribunal, this Tribunal must accept that the *Achmea* Wathelet Opinion concerning discrimination *still stands as part of the acquis, unless the Tribunal were prepared to declare that Opinion fundamentally wrong as a matter of EU law (i.e., as incorrectly interpreting the TFEU). But this would be fundamentally inconsistent with Croatia's argument that the Tribunal should not second-guess the prevailing interpretations of the acquis that were provided by the competent EU bodies.*260\n\n*Addiko* Decision (CLM-250), para 301; *UniCredit* Reconsideration Decision (CLM-251), para 234.\n\nClaimants' Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*, paras 30-33, citing Addiko Decision (CLM-250), para 301 and *UniCredit* Reconsideration Decision (CLM-251), para 235.\n\n*Addiko* Decision (CLM-250), para 301.\n\n285.\n\nAdvocate General Wathelet in his *Achmea* Opinion rejected the charge that intra-EU BITs are incompatible with Articles 18, 267 and 344 of the TFEU because they provide preferential treatment to nationals of the contracting states and thereby discriminate against other EU nationals.261 His opinion, writ large, was that the FET and other substantive protections in the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT\u2014which are generally found in BITs\u2014 exceed the scope of protection in the TEU and TFEU.262\n\n*Achmea* Wathelet Opinion (CLM-177), para 180.\n\n*Achmea* Wathelet Opinion (CLM-177), paras 179-228.\n\n**(2) Compatibility with the GATS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent did not pursue its incompatibility arguments based on the GATS at the Hearing or in its Post-Hearing Brief. Based on the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal, like the tribunal in *Addiko*, is not convinced that the GATS is part of the EU *acquis*.263\n\n*Addiko* Decision (CLM-250), para 305.\n\n287.\n\nAssuming for the sake of argument that the GATS is part of the *acquis* for purposes of Article 11(2) of the BIT, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the two treaties are not incompatible given that the BIT does not require Austria and Croatia to provide less favorable \"investment incentives or restrictions\" to other WTO members than they provide to each other. It is compelling that a contrary interpretation would leave all WTO Member States that are parties to BITs in violation of the GATS.\n\n**IX. THE MONETARY GOLD PRINCIPLE**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent makes the additional argument that, if the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction in this dispute, it would \"condemn the Republic of Austria to incurring responsibility under the EU *acquis* as much as it would trigger responsibility for the Respondent\" as the other Contracting State to the BIT, and thereby run afoul of the *Monetary Gold* principle.264\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 162.\n\n289.\n\nAs summarized by Croatia, the *Monetary Gold* principle, as set out by the ICJ in the eponymous case, bars jurisdiction where the legal interests of a third state not before the Court would form the very subject matter of the Court's decision. The purpose is to prevent determination of the third state's legal obligations without that state's consent.265\n\nRespondent's Memorial, paras 160-162, citing, *inter alia*, *Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom and United States of America)*, Judgement, 15 June 1954, ICJ Reports 19 (***Monetary Gold***) (RLM-108), para 45.\n\n290.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the *Monetary Gold* principle is inapplicable for several reasons.\n\n291.\n\nFirst, only Croatia has ever invoked the *Monetary Gold* principle in investor-state arbitration cases.266 According to Raiffeisen, the fact that none of the other state respondents in the more than 24 cases challenging jurisdiction in intra-EU investment arbitrations has raised the principle \"demonstrates that in reality the principle does not apply in these disputes.\"267\n\nClaimants' Counter-Memorial, paras 247-248.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 205.\n\n292.\n\nSecond, RBI and RBHR argue that the *Monetary Gold* principle is not engaged just because a tribunal must address a question affecting the legal interests of the relevant third state. The ICJ has found that even the \"simultaneous determination of responsibility\" of a third state is insufficient to trigger the *Monetary Gold* principle. What instead is required, say the Claimants, is that the ICJ would have to rule \"as a prerequisite\" to its decision on the lawfulness of the third state's conduct without that state's consent to the Court's jurisdiction.268 Given that Croatia's argument here is premised on the supposition that, if the Tribunal finds jurisdiction, it \"would, at the same time, inevitably condemn Austria to incurring responsibility under the EU *acquis* as much as it would trigger responsibility for the Respondent,\" the present case would not trigger the *Monetary Gold* principle.269\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, paras 207-215, citing *East Timor (Portugal v. Australia)*, Judgment, 30 June 1995, [1995] ICJ 90 (RLM-109), paras 28, 35.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras 241-242.\n\n293.\n\nThird, RBI and RBHR point out that the ICJ, in limiting the scope of the *Monetary Gold* principle, has underscored that its decisions are binding only on the parties before it, thus safeguarding the rights of third states. The same would hold true of any jurisdiction decision made by this Tribunal, which would have binding force only between Raiffeisen and Croatia, thereby not endangering Austria's international rights and obligations.270\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, para 216.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions, the Tribunal finds that the *Monetary Gold* principle is not engaged in this case.\n\n295.\n\nAs reflected in the reasoning above, there is no need for the Tribunal to rule on any aspect of Austria's conduct as a prerequisite to finding jurisdiction. A decision by the Tribunal that it has jurisdiction\u2014or, for that matter, that it does not\u2014may indirectly affect the legal interests of Austria (or its nationals) as well as those of Croatia, but no issue of Austrian state responsibility under the EU *acquis* or the BIT is involved. Croatia is the state whose legal responsibility is being invoked.\n\n296.\n\nTo echo the words of the Addiko tribunal, \"Austria's procedural and substantive rights thus will remain entirely unaffected by this Decision and by whatever ruling the Tribunal eventually renders on other issues as between [the Claimants] and Croatia.\"271\n\n*Addiko* Decision (CLM-250), para 307.\n\n297.\n\nIn sum, the BIT remains fully in force and valid under the applicable international law of treaties. The Tribunal is validly seized with jurisdiction under the BIT and must proceed to decide the substantive disputes before it.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Costs**\n------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs, first submitted on 6 March 2010 and updated on 6 July 2020, the Respondent seeks an award of its full costs of arbitration in connection with its Preliminary Objections, including all legal fees, expenses and other costs in the combined amount of HRK 20,000.00, EUR 2,371,183.45 and GBP 17,435.60. These costs, which do not include Tribunal and ICSID fees, break down as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Item** | **Amount (HRK)** | **Amount (EUR)** | **Amount (GBP)** |\n| Legal fees and expenses |  | 2,358,215.09 |  |\n| Fees and expenses of EU law expert |  |  | 17,435.60 |\n| Fees and expenses of other experts (prior to suspension on the merits) |  | 12,968.36 |  |\n| Additional client costs | 20,000 |  |  |\n| Tribunal and ICSID fees |  |  |  |\n| SUBTOTAL | 20,000 | 2,371,183.45 | 17,435.60 |\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent determined not to maintain its objections that the Claimants were not qualified investors that had made qualified investments under the BIT. However, Croatia reserved its rights in relation to costs, on grounds that the Claimants had failed to provide the necessary evidence until their Counter-Memorial, despite having had two earlier opportunities to do so when filing their Memorial on the Merits and their Response to Croatia's Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Request to Suspend the Proceedings on the Merits.272\n\nRespondent's Reply, para 4.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Costs**\n----------------------------\n\n300.\n\nIn their Submission on Costs dated 6 March 2020, the Claimants seek their full costs of arbitration, including all legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred in connection with the Preliminary Objections. Based on tables of the total hours and fees for each attorney and law firm employee and other costs by category, the total amount in the Claimants' Submission on Costs is EUR 1,743,177.58,273 broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Item** | **Amount (EUR)** |\n| Legal fees | 1,248,086.70 |\n| Expert fees | 142,670.31 |\n| ICSID registration fee and advance payments | 273,000.00 (USD 300,000.00) |\n| Travel | 71,502.93 |\n| Document printing | 4,002.51 |\n| Outside services | 2,122.54 |\n| Research/publications | 1,006.10 |\n| After-hours support | 786.49 |\n| **TOTAL** | **1,743,177.58** |\n\nThe Tribunal has identified an arithmetic error in the sum of the Claimants' claimed costs. The sum total is EUR 1,743,177.58 and not EUR 1,743,117.58 as stated in paragraphs 3 and 10 of the Claimants' Statement of Costs dated 6 March 2020.\n\n301.\n\nIn their Supplemental Submission on Costs dated 6 July 2020, the Claimants seek an additional amount of EUR 8,518.00 in legal fees for preparation of the Observations on *Addiko* and *UniCredit*. This brings Raiffeisen's total costs claim to EUR 1,751,695.58, plus pre- and post-award interest at 2.54% (RBHR's opportunity cost of capital) compounded annually.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants submit that these total costs are reasonable and proportionate in light of the nature and complexity of the Preliminary Objections. The Claimants further note that they have entered into a success fee arrangement with WilmerHale providing for an uplift on the hourly rates paid, and reserve the right to claim reimbursement of their costs in line with this agreement at the end of this arbitration.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal has unanimously determined that the Respondent shall pay the Claimants their full costs of arbitration for this Preliminary Objections phase, on the ground that the Claimants have prevailed in full in their defenses to the Respondent's Preliminary Objections. The Claimants claim EUR 1,751,695.58 in costs. However, this sum includes the ICSID registration fee and the total amount of Claimants' advance payments to date, the latter of which is not fully expended. The Secretariat has advised the Tribunal that the expended amount of the Claimants' advance payments is 277,493.74 as of the date of this Decision.
