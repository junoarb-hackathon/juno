PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND CLAIMS OF THE PARTIES\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this case is the Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. (CSOB), a commercial bank organized under Czech law; the Respondent is the Slovak Republic. Claimant filed its \"Request for Arbitration\" with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or Center) on April 18, 1997, charging Respondent with a breach of the \"Agreement on the Basic Principles of a Financial Consolidation of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S.\" (Consolidation Agreement), which was concluded on December 19, 1993 by the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic, and CSOB. Claimant alleged that the breach consisted in the failure of the Slovak Republic to cover the losses incurred by the Slovenska inkasni spol, s.r.o (Slovak Collection Company), as agreed to in the Consolidation Agreement. It seeks fulfillment by Respondent of its obligations under the Consolidation Agreement and damages for the losses sustained, plus costs. The request was registered by the Centre on April 25, 1997.\n\n2.\n\nThe Consolidation Agreement, which was designed to facilitate the privatization of CSOB and its operation in the Czech and Slovak Republics after their separation, provided, *inter alia,* for the assignment by CSOB of certain non-performing loan portfolio receivables to two so-called \"Collection Companies,\" one to be established by the Czech Republic, the other by the Slovak Republic, in their respective national territories. The Consolidation Agreement also stipulated that each Collection Company was to pay CSOB for the assigned receivables. To enable them to do so, each Collection Company was to receive the necessary funds from CSOB under the terms of separate loan agreements, such loans to be paid down in accordance with a stipulated repayment schedule.\n\n3.\n\nThe Collection Companies were established by the respective Republics as contemplated by the Consolidation Agreement. Thereafter CSOB and the newly created Slovak Collection Company concluded the \"Loan Agreement on the Refinancing of Assigned Receivables\" (Loan Agreement), with the effective date of December 31, 1993. Section 7 of the Loan Agreement, entitled \"Security\", refers to the Consolidation Agreement and declares that pursuant to the latter agreement, \"the repayment of the loan including interest thereon is secured by an obligation of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.\" This obligation is confirmed at the bottom of the Loan Agreement where, following the signa-tures of the representatives of CSOB and the Slovak Collection Company, the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic, on behalf of his Ministry, \"consents to and acknowledges the contents of this Agreement and, in particular, confirms its obligation under Section 7 of this Agreement.\"\n\n4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration notes that the Czech and Slovak Republics are parties to the \"Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\" (ICSID Convention), the Czech Republic as of April 22, 1993 and the Slovak Republic as of June 26, 1994. Claimant bases the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction over this dispute on three grounds. It contends, first, that the \"Agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Czech Republic Regarding the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments\" (Bilateral Investment Treaty or BIT), signed on November 23, 1992, did enter into force on January 1, 1993 and that Article 8(2) thereof confers jurisdiction on the Centre to hear this dispute.1 Second, Claimant submits that even if the BIT had not entered into force as between the two Contracting States, it was binding on the Slovak Republic by virtue of the fact that the Slovak Foreign Ministry, in a Notice published on October 22, 1993 in the Official Gazette of the Slovak Republic, declared that the BIT had entered into force on January 1, 1993.2 Finally, Claimant contends that Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement incorporates the BIT by reference because it provides that \"this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and the Treaty on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic dated November 23, 1992.\" This incorporation is said to bind the Slovak Republic regardless of whether the BIT itself entered into force.\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n1. Any dispute which may arise between the investor of one Party and the other Party in relation to any investments made in the territory of such other Party, shall be subject to negotiations between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute between the investor of one Party and the other Party continues after a period of three months, the investor and the Party shall have the right to submit the dispute to either:\n\n1) the International Center for the Resolution of Investment-Related Disputes with special regard to the applicable provisions of the Treaty on the Resolution of Investment-Related Disputes arising between States and nationals of other States, open for signature in Washington D.C. on 18 March 1965, provided, however, that both Parties are parties to such Treaty; or\n\n2) an arbitrator or an ad hoc international arbitration tribunal established in accordance with the arbitration rules of the United Nations Organization Committee for International Trade Law. Parties to the dispute may agree in writing upon modifications of such rules. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute.\n\n3. The dispute shall be resolved by such agency referred to in Section 2 above as was the first one to which a proposal for the resolution of the dispute was submitted.\n\nThis Notice reads as follows:\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic announces that the Treaty on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Czech Republic was signed in Bratislava on November 23, 1992.\n\nPursuant to Article 12, the Treaty became effective on January 1, 1993.\n\n5.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), this Tribunal was deemed constituted and the proceedings to have begun on August 20, 1997, the date on which the parties were notified by the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID that Professor Andreas Bucher, appointed by the Claimant, Professor Piero Bernardini, appointed by the Respondent, and Professor Thomas Buergenthal, designated as President of the Tribunal by the Centre, had accepted their appointments. On that date, the Acting Secretary-General also informed the parties that Ms. Margrete Stevens, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn October 6, 1997, the Tribunal held its first session with the parties at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. At that session, the parties acknowledged that the Tribunal had been duly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.\n\n7.\n\nAt the same session, counsel for Respondent declared that the Slovak Republic considered that the instant dispute was not within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal and would interpose objections to jurisdiction. The President, acting in accordance with Article 41(2) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 41(3), thereupon suspended the proceedings on the merits and, after ascertaining the views of the parties, fixed the following time limits for the written phase of the proceedings relating to jurisdiction: (i) January 30, 1998\u2014Respondent to file memorial on jurisdiction; (ii) April 30, 1998\u2014Claimant to file counter-memorial on jurisdiction; (iii) July 31, 1998\u2014Respondent to file reply; (iv) October 30, 1998\u2014Claimant to file rejoinder. The oral hearing on jurisdiction was fixed to commence on January 4, 1999. (The opening date of the hearing was subsequently moved to January 5, 1999.)\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated May 18, 1998 Respondent requested the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 43(a) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 34(2), to order Claimant to produce copies of various documents Respondent alleged would provide evidence bearing on its contention that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear this dispute. By Procedural Order No.l, dated June 8, 1998, the Tribunal granted only that part of Respondent\u2019s request which sought the production by Claimant of \"all documents in the custody or control of CSOB in any way relating to a guarantee and/or proposed issuance of a guarantee, whether or not a guarantee is currently in effect.\"\n\n9.\n\nBetween the October 6, 1997 session and the commencement of the oral phase of the proceedings on January 5, 1999 Claimant, invoking Arbitration Rule 39, requested the Tribunal on different occasions to issue provisional measures and emergency interim restraining measures in accordance with Articles 47 and 26 of the ICSID Convention, seeking the suspension of the bankruptcy proceedings pending against the Slovak Collection Company in Slovak courts. The Tribunal dealt with these requests in Procedural Orders Nos. 2, 3 and 4 of September 9, 1998, November 5, 1998 and January 11, 1999, respectively. While denying the requests for emergency interim restraining measures and deferring action on the requests for provisional measures in Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3, the Tribunal granted the latter relief in Procedural Order No. 4. In it the Tribunal recommended the suspension of the aforementioned bankruptcy proceedings \"to the extent that such proceedings might include determinations as to whether the Slovenska inkasni spol, s.r.o. [Slovak Collection Company] has a valid claim in the form of a right to receive funds from the Slovak Republic to cover its losses as contemplated in the Consolidation Agreement at issue in this arbitration.\"\n\n10.\n\nIn its Memorials and in the oral phase of the proceedings, Respondent challenges the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that the requirements of Article 25 (1) of the Convention for the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence have not been complied with in this case. To support its contention, Respondent submits, first, that the requirement of Article 25(1) that the dispute must be \"between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State,\" has not been satisfied in this case. With regard to this issue, Respondent contends: a) that CSOB is merely an agent of the Czech Republie, and b) that the subsequent assignments to the Czech Republic of CSOB\u2019s interest in the receivables, which constitute the subject matter of the dispute, transformed the Czech Republic into the real party in interest to this case.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s second contention is that the \"consent in writing,\" required under Article 25(1) of the Convention for the submission of disputes to the Centre, is lacking in the instant case because: a) the BIT on which Claimant relies never entered into force; b) the notice published in the Slovak Republic\u2019s Official Gazette did not bring the BIT into force or make it part of Slovak law and, therefore, cannot constitute effective consent to arbitration; c) the clause in the BIT referring to the Consolidation Agreement, characterized by Respondent as a governing law provision, cannot be deemed to constitute effective consent unless and until the BIT enters into force; and d) even assuming the BIT was in force, the parties had not \"jointly\" invoked Article 8\u2014its arbitration provision\u2014and, moreover, the dispute did not relate to \"investments\" as that concept is defined in the Convention and the BIT. As for the argument that the consent to arbitration envisaged under the BIT required a joint submission, Respondent asserts that a proper reading of the Czech and Slovak texts of Article 8 of the BIT compels that conclusion.\n\n12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s final submission under Article 25(1) focuses on the contention that the dispute was not one \"arising directly out of an investment.\" Here Respondent contends, in the first place, that the loan to the Slovak Collection Company was not an \"investment.\" Rather, it was an element of the inter-governmental restructuring and division of CSOB, necessitated by the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR), and not an operation from which either party to the dispute was intended to receive a benefit. According to Respondent, moreover, CSOB\u2019s claims did not arise \"directly\" out of the loan and, therefore, cannot be deemed to arise \"directly\" out of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n13.\n\nThe oral phase of these proceedings commenced on January 5, 1999 and concluded on January 7, 1999.\n\n14.\n\nAlthough the January 5-7, 1999 hearing was originally intended to address only the issue of jurisdiction, the Tribunal granted Claimant\u2019s motion to permit the parties also briefly to address Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures.3 By agreement of the parties, no witnesses were heard during this entire hearing. Instead, both parties submitted and relied on witness affidavits and expert opinions.\n\nFor the outcome of the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations relating to this request for provisional measures, see para. 9, *supra.*\n\nII. IS CLAIMANT A NATIONAL OF A CONTRACTING STATE?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe first ground on which Respondent challenges the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal is that Claimant does not meet that requirement of Article 25(1), which provides that the dispute must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. According to Respondent, the instant dispute is between two Contracting States because: a) Claimant is a state agency of the Czech Republic rather than an independent commercial entity; and b) the real party in interest to this dispute is the Czech Republic.\n\n*A. National of Another Contracting State*\n------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe language of Article 25(1) of the Convention makes clear that the Centre does not have jurisdiction over disputes between two or more Contracting States. Instead, the dispute settlement mechanism set up by the Convention is designed to deal with disputes between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States. Although the concept of \"national\", as that term is used in Article 25(1), is in Article 25(2) declared to include both natural and juridical persons, neither term is defined as such in the Convention. The legislative history of the Convention does provide some answers, however, that bear on the issues presented in this case. It indicates that the term \"juridical persons\" as employed in Article 25 and, hence, the concept of \"national,\" was not intended to be limited to privately-owned companies, but to embrace also wholly or partially government-owned companies. This interpretation has found general acceptance.\n\n17.\n\nIt follows that the question whether a company qualifies as a \"national of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) does not depend upon whether or not the company is partially or wholly owned by the government. Instead, the accepted test for making this determination has been formulated as follows: \"... for purposes of the Convention a mixed economy company or government-owned corporation should not be disqualified as a national of another Contracting State\u2019 unless it is acting as an agent for the government or is discharging an essentially governmental function.\"4 Both parties to this dispute accept this test as determinative.\n\nA. Broches, *The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,* 135 Hague Rec. d. Cours 331, at 354-5 (1972).\n\n18.\n\nThe soundness of Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimant is not \"a national of another Contracting State\" must therefore be judged by reference to this test. Standing alone, Respondent\u2019s submission that more than 65% of CSOB\u2019s shares are owned in one form or another by the Czech Republic and that some 24% are owned by the Slovak Republic demonstrate that CSOB is a public sector rather than a private sector entity, does not address the here crucial issue. Neither does the submission that the Czech Republic\u2019s 65% stock ownership gives it absolute control over CSOB. For, as has been shown above, such ownership or control alone will not disqualify a company under the here relevant test from filing a claim with the Centre as \"a national of a another Contracting State.\"\n\n19.\n\nRespondent does not, however, rest this aspect of its case solely on the above arguments. It contends further that CSOB is a government agency which has been discharging essentially governmental functions throughout its existence and, more specifically, with regard to all events pertinent to this dispute. In this regard, Respondent seeks to show that since its inception CSOB has served as agent or representative of the State to the international banking and trading community, that its subsequent reorganization has not changed its status, and that, moreover, the instant dispute arises out of the functions CSOB performed in that capacity.\n\n20.\n\nIt cannot be denied that for much of its existence, CSOB acted on behalf of the State in facilitating or executing the international banking transactions and foreign commercial operations the State wished to support and that the State\u2019s control of CSOB required it to do the State\u2019s bidding in that regard. But in determining whether CSOB, in discharging these functions, exercised governmental functions, the focus must be on the nature of these activities and not their purpose. While it cannot be doubted that in performing the above-mentioned activities, CSOB was promoting the governmental policies or purposes of the State, the activities themselves were essentially commercial rather than governmental in nature.\n\n21.\n\nIt also appears that beginning in the early 1990\u2019s and following the 1989 \"Velvet Revolution,\" as the State began to transform its command economy into a market economy, CSOB took various steps to gradually throw off its exclusive economic dependence on the State and to adopt measures to enable it to function in this new economic environment as an independent commercial bank. By 1993, CSOB seemed to have basically achieved that purpose, although its competitive position continued to be adversely affected by the existence on its books of non-performing receivables. These receivables, which became the subject of the Consolidation Agreement and play a role in the instant dispute, grew out of CSOB\u2019s earlier lending activities during the State\u2019s non-market economy period. Although these activities were driven by State policies, as was true generally of economic activities during the country\u2019s command economy, the banking transactions themselves that implemented these policies did not thereby lose their commercial nature. They cannot therefore be characterized as governmental in nature. Moreover, even if one were to conclude that the non-performing assets derived from activities conducted by CSOB as an agent of the State, the measures taken by CSOB to remove them from its books in order to improve its balance and consolidate its financial position in accordance with the provisions of the Consolidation Agreement, must be deemed to be commercial in character.\n\n22.\n\nIn support of its contention that the dispute is between two Contracting States, Respondent also submits that the ultimate goal of the Consolidation Agreement was the privatization of CSOB. Characterizing privatization as a State function, Respondent argues that in concluding the Consolidation Agreement, CSOB was performing State functions and could therefore not claim to be a private investor. In this connection, Respondent submits that\n\nThe principal ingredient in the Consolidation Agreement preparing CSOB for privatization was the proposed removal of the poor-quality assets resulting from CSOB\u2019s role in financing the Czechoslovak State\u2019s foreign trade.... The whole structure of Consolidated Agreement, Loan Agreement and Collection Companies, which is central to this arbitration, was thus conceived and implemented with the express purpose of facilitating CSOB\u2019s privatization. (Respondent\u2019s Reply Memorial, at 34.)\n\n23.\n\nIt cannot be denied that a State\u2019s decision to transform itself from a command economy to a free market economy involves the exercise of governmental functions. The same is no doubt true of legislative and administrative measures adopted by the State that are designed to enable or facilitate the privatization of State-owned enterprises. It does not follow, however, that a State-owned enterprise is performing State functions when it takes advantage of these State policies and proceeds to restructure itself, with or without governmental cooperation, in order to be in a position to compete in a free market economy. Nor does it follow that the measures taken by such an enterprise to achieve this objective involve the performance of State or governmental functions. In both instances, the test as to whether or not the acts are governmental or private turn on their nature.\n\n24.\n\nThere appears to be some disagreement between the parties to this case as to whether the conclusion of the Consolidation Agreement and the Loan Agreement was driven by or was part of the privatization process instituted by the Government or whether it was the result largely of CSOB\u2019s unrelated business decision to strengthen its financial position. The Tribunal does not believe that it matters which of these views is accepted, for whether CSOB\u2019s actions were or were not driven by the privatization process set in motion or facilitated by the State is not determinative of the issue to be decided. What is determinative is the nature of these acts.\n\n25.\n\nIn the instant case, the steps taken by CSOB to solidify its financial position in order to attract private capital for its restructured banking enterprise do not differ in their nature from measures a private bank might take to strengthen its financial position. It is no doubt true that CSOB\u2019s ability to negotiate the Consolidation Agreement and Loan Agreements on favorable conditions can be attributed to the interest both the Czech and Slovak Governments had in seeing CSOB survive in a free market environment and continue to provide needed banking services. But that fact does not transform the otherwise commercial or private transactions here at issue into governmental acts.\n\n26.\n\nFinally, in support of its submission that the instant dispute is between two States Parties, Respondent contends that all the parties to the Consolidation Agreement are State entities and that they include, in addition to CSOB and the Czech and Slovak Republics, the Czech National Bank, the Czech National Property Fund and the National Bank of Slovakia. Even assuming, without deciding, that these other entities had also become parties to the Consolidation Agreement, this fact would not weaken or overcome the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions, set out in the preceding paragraphs, about the commercial character of the Consolidation Agreement or the functions CSOB performed.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, accordingly, that Respondent has failed to sustain its contention that the Centre lacks jurisdiction and the Tribunal competence to hear this case on the ground that Claimant was acting as an agent of the State or discharging essentially governmental activities as far as this dispute is concerned. This is so whether or not this determination is made by reference to the date of the conclusion of the Consolidation Agreement (December 19, 1993) or the date when the Request for Arbitration was registered by the Centre (April 25, 1997).\n\n*B. Real Party in Interest*\n---------------------------\n\n28.\n\nRespondent next points to two assignments, dated April 24, 1998 and June 25, 1998, respectively, which CSOB concluded with the Czech Ministry of Finance. These assignments, according to Respondent, have transformed the Czech Republic\u2014the assignee\u2014into the real party in interest to the instant arbitration by relieving CSOB of the economic risk arising from the claims relating to the Slovak Collection Company receivables. Respondent argues that the assignments require the Tribunal to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction because Claimant no longer has the requisite standing under Article 25(1) and because the Czech Republic is disqualified under the same provision from stepping into CSOB\u2019s shoes.\n\n29.\n\nIn view of the fact that the first assignment has been fully superseded by the second, the Tribunal needs to focus here only on the latter. In that instrument CSOB agrees to assign to the Czech Republic on a so-called \"effective date\" all claims CSOB has against the Slovak Collection Company relating to the receivables transferred to the latter under the Loan Agreement as well as the claims CSOB has against the Slovak Republic under the Consolidation Agreement. The \"effective date\" is three days after the date on which the assignee receives in writing assignor\u2019s request for the delivery of the receivables and the rights attaching thereto. However, the assignee does not have the right to request the assignment prior to the completion of the instant arbitration proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nThe specified \"consideration\" which assignee is required to pay assignor consists of an amount equal to 90% of the nominal value of the receivables as of December 31, 2002. This payment is to be made within three days following the termination of the arbitration proceedings, but no earlier than the above mentioned date. If the arbitration should not be completed by December 31, 2002, assignee is required to increase that amount to a \"deposit\" of 100% of the agreed upon nominal value of the receivables. On the other hand, if the assignor should receive any payment in settlement of the receivables, the consideration is to be reduced by 75% of the amount so received. The assignor is entitled to 25% of any amounts received by assignee following the assignment in repayment of the assigned receivables paid after December 31, 2002, and 10% before January 1, 2003.\n\n31.\n\nIn assessing the effect of the June 25, 1998 assignment (and of the April 24.1998 assignment it superseded) on the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction to hear this dispute, the Tribunal notes, in the first place, that the Request for Arbitration in the instant case was filed on April 17, 1997 and that the case was registered on April 25, 1997. Hence, at the time when these proceedings were instituted, neither of these assignments had been concluded. Second, it is generally recognized that the determination whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted. Since the Claimant instituted these proceedings prior to the time when the two assignments were concluded, it follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this case regardless of the legal effect, if any, the assignments might have had on Claimant\u2019s standing had they preceded the filing of the case.\n\n32.\n\nIn the light of what has just been said, it is not really necessary for the Tribunal to address Respondent\u2019s contention that the assignments here in question transformed the Czech Republic into the real party in interest because it became, for all practical purposes, the beneficial owner of the disputed claims and because Claimant, as a result, no longer has a real economic interest in the outcome of these proceedings. But even if the Tribunal, for purposes of the argument, were to accept this contention, it would not follow that this case would have to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. This conclusion is compelled by the consideration that absence of beneficial ownership by a claimant in a claim or the transfer of the economic risk in the outcome of a dispute should not and has not been deemed to affect the standing of a claimant in an ICSID proceeding, regardless whether or not the beneficial owner is a State Party or a private party. It must be emphasized, moreover, that the second assignment does not deprive claimant of an interest in the outcome of the case because the assignment becomes effective only after these proceedings terminate and because the assignor remains entitled to a share (either 25 or 10%) of the amount received by the assignee.\n\nIII. IS THERE CONSENT TO ICSID JURISDICTION?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nUnder the system created by the ICSID Convention, consent by both parties is an indispensable condition for the exercise of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 25(1). The Convention only requires that consent be in writing, leaving the parties otherwise free to choose the manner in which to express their consent. Although the most common form of consent is an agreement recorded in a single instrument, other expressions of consent are equally valid, provided they are in writing.\n\n34.\n\nIn determining how to interpret agreements to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is guided by an ICSID decision which held that\n\na convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively,* nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly* or *liberally* It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties.... Moreover,...any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.5\n\nAmco Asia et al. v. Indonesia, Decision on Jurisdiction of September 25, 1983, 23 I.L.M. 359 (1984).\n\n35.\n\nThe question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is governed by international law as set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n36.\n\nIn the instant case, Claimant invokes ICSID jurisdiction by pointing to three independent bases of consent, namely: a) the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) as an international treaty in force between the two States; b) the notice published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic in the Official Gazette on October 22, 1993 (the \"Notice\"), announcing the entry into force of the BIT on January 1, 1993; and c) the reference to the BIT in the Consolidation Agreement.\n\n*A. The BIT*\n------------\n\n37.\n\nThe question whether the BIT is in force is relevant in the instant case since Article 8 of the BIT contains an ICSID arbitration clause. If the BIT entered into force on January 1, 1993 or on some other date, the Slovak Republic would be bound by the consent so given, because Article 8 provides for the settlement of investment disputes at the option of the party initiating the arbitration proceedings, either under the ICSID Convention or the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL\").\n\n38.\n\nSince Claimant by its Request for Arbitration, dated April 18, 1997, submitted the instant dispute to ICSID, Claimant would be deemed to have accepted ICSID jurisdiction on that date, Respondent having already unequivocally consented to it. The exchange of consents in this form would satisfy the requirement of a \"written consent\" under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention . This type of consent has been accepted as a valid submission to the Center's jurisdiction in the first case brought by an investor under a bilateral investment treaty, 6 and has found acceptance in subsequent practice. 7\n\nAsian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v. Republic of Sri Lanka, 4 ICSID Rep. 245, 30I.L.M. 577 (1991).\n\nC. Schreuer, \"Commentary on the ICSID Convention: Article 25,\" 11 ICSID Rev.\u2014 Foreign Investment L. J. 441 (1996).\n\n39.\n\nThe elements of proof presented by Claimant and Respondent on the question whether the BIT has entered into force are by no means conclusive enough to permit a definite answer. Article 12 of the BIT provides that \"each Party shall give notice to the other Party of the completion of the constitutional formalities required for this Agreement to enter into force\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this language shows that the parties were aware and mutually recognized that the signature of the BIT by the two heads of government was not sufficient to bring the treaty into force and that further formalities were required under the respective constitutions. Whether or not such constitutional formalities needed to be complied with as a matter of domestic law\u2014an issue on which the parties disagree\u2014 is relatively immaterial, considering the above-quoted stipulation included in the \"Entry into force\" provision of the BIT. This provision must be deemed to have some meaning as required under the principle of effectiveness *{effet utile).* It may, consequently, not be disregarded as contemplating a mere procedural formality not affecting the coming into force of the BIT. This is so particularly when the language is read in the light of Article 24(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"Vienna Convention\"), which provides that \"a treaty enters into force in such manner and upon such date as it may provide or as the negotiating States may agree.\" The Tribunal notes, in this connection, that the Parties agree that no such exchange of notices has taken place. The documents on file in this case indicate, moreover, that this is also the position of the Czech Republic.\n\n40.\n\nIn its pleadings, Claimant has made reference to Article 46 of the Vienna Convention. Under that provision a State's right to invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty violates a provision of its internal law regarding jurisdiction to conclude treaties is limited to cases in which such violation was manifest, that is, \"if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith \". However, this provision deals with the \"Invalidity of Treaties\", whereas the Slovak Republic claims that the BIT never came into force due to the non-compliance with its Article 12. The Slovak Republic does not claim that the treaty is invalid,\n\n41.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 12 of the BIT provides that the treaty shall come into force as of the date of the division of the two Republics. Claimant contends that this provision should prevail over the above-quoted procedural formalities calling for the exchange of notices signalling the completion of the constitutional requirement found in the first sentence of Article 12, especially because both States knew that the division would occur on January 1, 1993. Respondent submits, on the other hand, that this provision should be interpreted to mean that once the exchange of notices contemplated by the first sentence had taken place, the treaty would be effective as of the date of division, the division being another condition for the coming into force of the BIT. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s interpretation is more consistent with the requirements of the principle of effectiveness than is Claimant\u2019s submission on that subject.\n\n42.\n\nThe numerous declarations issued by different authorities of the two States in various circumstances and the expert opinions which have been produced by both parties, expressing conflicting views regarding the coming into force of the BIT, are not particularly helpful due to the fact that they are inconclusive and contradictory. Little would therefore be gained by reviewing them. Equally unhelpful would be an analysis of the question whether the BIT can be characterized as a \"Governmental Treaty\" (not requiring approval by Parliament nor Presidential ratification) or a \"Presidential Treaty\" (subject to such approval). This is so because the wording of Article 12 of the BIT does not fit into one or the other of these categories of treaties.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly holds that the uncertainties relating to the entry into force of the BIT prevent that instrument from providing a sound basis upon which to found the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*B. The Notice*\n---------------\n\n44.\n\nICSID practice also indicates that the exchange of written consents required for ICSID jurisdiction can be satisfied not only by the mutual acceptances of bilateral investment treaties, but also by other forms of acceptances. Many investment laws of developing countries provide for the State\u2019s acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction (or for alternative dispute resolution methods) for disputes with the investor arising out of a particular investment. Under some laws the offer is deemed to be accepted as soon as the foreign investor files an investment application pursuant to such a law, regardless of whether the application includes a reference to the arbitration provision contained in the law. The aforementioned laws differ from the present case in that the offer of consent by the Slovak State is not contained in a domestic legislative act (or an international treaty in force for that State) but, rather, in a notice of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, published in the Official Gazette, announcing that the BIT had entered into force on January 1, 1993.8\n\nSee note 2, *supra.*\n\n45.\n\nRespondent contends that the publication of the BIT in the Official Gazette did not result in its entry into force, nor give that treaty any other legal effect under Slovak law. Claimant, on the other hand, considers the publication to constitute a sufficient basis upon which to found the Slovak Republic\u2019s consent to ICSID jurisdiction, even if the underlying legal instrument (the BIT) did not enter into force. In this connection, it should be noted that if the Notice were to be held to constitute a valid offer by the Slovak State to submit to international arbitration, the corrective notice published by the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Official Gazette on November 20, 1997, asserting the invalidity of the BIT, would be of no avail to Respondent, since Claimant accepted the offer in the Request for Arbitration filed prior to the publication of the corrective notice.\n\n46.\n\nIt must now be determined whether the original Notice published in the Official Gazette provides a sufficient basis for holding the Slovak State to be bound under Article 8 of the BIT. Even if the Notice were to be characterized as a unilateral declaration by the Slovak State, it still needs to be asked whether it was \"the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms\", as required by the international law principles applicable to unilateral declarations.9 Pursuant to these principles, unilateral assumption of the contractual obligations is \"not lightly to be presumed...\" and requires \"a very consistent course of conduct.\"10 As noted by one authoritative source, \"while the principle applied by the [International] Court [of Justice]\u2014that a unilateral declaration may have certain legal effects\u2014is not new, when the declaration is not directed to a specific state or states but is expressed *erga omnes,* as here, the detection of an intention to be legally bound, and of the structure of such intention, involves very careful appreciation of the facts. \"11 Given this standard, the Tribunal considers that the Slovak Republic\u2019s intention to be bound by the treaty through the Notice has not been established. This is so particularly when it is recalled that the entry into force of the treaty appears to have been conditioned on an exchange of notices which, as we have seen did not take place. (See para. 39, *supra?)*\n\nNuclear Tests Case (Australia v. France), I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 253, at 274. *See also* Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), I.C.J.

Brownlie, *Public International Law* 638-39 (4th ed. 1990)\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal must now turn to the question whether the Slovak State is estopped because of the Notice from denying that it is bound by the arbitration offer under the BIT. An essential element of estoppel is that \"there must be reliance in good faith upon the statement either to the detriment of the party so relying on the statement or to the advantage of the party making the statement\"12. Claimant nowhere alleges that it was misled by Respondent or that it relied on any allegedly misleading statements by Respondent and that it was prejudiced as a consequence of such reliance. Instead, it is clear from a draft of the Consolidation Agreement, prepared by CSOB after the date of the Notice, that it relied neither on the BIT being in force nor on the fact that Article 8 thereof had become binding on the Slovak State. In that draft, CSOB initially proposed arbitration in Prague and referred to the BIT \"after it is ratified.\" (See para. 50, *infra.)*\n\nBrownlie, *supra,* at 641. *See also* B. Cheng, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals* 141 *et. seq.* (1987)\n\n48.\n\nSince the second basis for consent to ICSID jurisdiction has not been established, the Tribunal must now examine Claimant\u2019s third basis for establishing such consent.\n\n*C. The Consolidation Agreement*\n--------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Consolidation Agreement, entered into between the parties to these proceedings (the question of identifying all parties to the Agreement being immaterial for the purposes of the present analysis), provides in the relevant part of Article 7 that \"this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and the Treaty on the Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic dated 23 November 1992.\" It must, therefore, be determined whether this reference to the BIT must be deemed to constitute acceptance by the Slovak Republic of ICSID jurisdiction. Specifically, the question to be resolved is whether the consent required under the ICSID Convention can be satisfied by a reference to a treaty that is not in force on the international plane.\n\n50.\n\nThe parties have expressed conflicting views regarding the significance of the reference to the BIT in the Consolidation Agreement. Claimant contends that it is immaterial whether the reference is characterized as a choice-of-law clause or an incorporation by reference. To Claimant, the decisive question is whether the provision can be interpreted as an agreement to submit to ICSID jurisdiction. Relying on the text of the clause and its reference to the BIT, Claimant contends that it constitutes an incorporation by reference of ICSID jurisdiction. Respondent submits that the reference to the BIT is made in the context of a choice-of-law provision, with both Czech law and the BIT equally governing the interpretation of the contract. Since the BIT never came into force, the reference to it should be disregarded. Respondent further contends that even if Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement were to be interpreted as an incorporation by reference, the reference itself cannot be deemed to amount to consent to arbitration. In support of this contention, Respondent points, *inter alia,* to the UNCITRAL\u2019s Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration of June 21, 1985, whose Article 7(2) states in part: \"The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement provided that the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.\"\n\n51.\n\nThe negotiating history of the provision under examination offers elements permitting the Tribunal to determine the parties\u2019 common intent regarding the issue here under consideration. The documents submitted by the parties show that the Consolidation Agreement was the subject of various drafts due to changes requested by Respondent. This latter circumstance provides a sufficient basis for rejecting Respondent\u2019s argument that the *contra proferentem* rule should be applied against Claimant by holding that the reference to the BIT in Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement does not embody consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n52.\n\nIt is uncontested and fully borne out by the record that in reply to a draft of the Consolidation Agreement submitted by the Slovak Republic on or about November 15, 1993, containing neither a governing law clause nor a dispute-settlement provision, CSOB proposed various drafts in the period between November 15-December 17, 1993, including a governing law provision referring to Czech law only and an arbitration clause referring disputes to the Arbitration Tribunal of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Prague. The latter reference was not accepted by Respondent. After further revisions the parties agreed to a final draft, which included the following provision: \"This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and the Treaty on the promotion and mutual protection of investments between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic after it is ratified.\" The final draft of the Consolidation Agreement makes no express reference to arbitration or to any other method of dispute settlement, but before it was signed on December 17/ 19, 1993, the above provision was amended by deleting the words \"after it is ratified\" and by replacing it with the date of the signature of the BIT.\n\n53.\n\nThe parties have given different explanations for this amendment. For the purposes of the present analysis, it is relevant to note, first, that the issue of the settlement of disputes through arbitration was raised in the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of the Consolidation Agreement; that a clause proposed by CSOB on that subject was rejected by the Slovak Republic; and that the final text as agreed by the parties contains no separate arbitration clause, although it does make reference to the BIT which provides for a dispute settlement method that permits resort either to the ICSID Convention or the UNCITRAL arbitration rules. Second, the reference in the final draft to the BIT \"after it is ratified\" would have justified the conclusion that the acceptance of the arbitration provision was conditioned upon the BIT\u2019s coming into force at international level; however, the phrase relating to ratification was eliminated from the signed text.\n\n54.\n\nThe negotiating history of the clause under consideration thus indicates that the issue of the dispute settlement method had been discussed by the parties and that the proposal to resort to domestic arbitration in the Czech Republic had been rejected by the Slovak party. These considerations support Claimant\u2019s contention that the parties eventually agreed on international arbitration. In the absence of a separate dispute resolution provision, the reference to the BIT satisfies the requirement that international arbitration, as specified in its Article 8, is the agreed dispute resolution mechanism. This reference cannot be understood to mean that the contested provision was intended to deal exclusively with the governing law question, as Respondent contends, if only because by eliminating the phrase relating to the BIT\u2019s ratification, the parties made the reference to the BIT and to the consent to arbitration expressed by it effective and unconditional. As a matter of fact, the elimination of the phrase may be deemed to indicate either that the parties were convinced that the BIT was already in force (the Notice announcing the BIT\u2019s status had appeared less than two months before) or, what is more likely, that they intended the reference to the BIT to be a valid expression of consent for purposes of their contract, including the provision for the settlement of disputes, independently of the BIT\u2019s entry into force on the international plane.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, therefore, that by referring to the BIT, the parties intended to incorporate Article 8 of the BIT by reference into the Consolidation Agreement, in order to provide for international arbitration as their chosen dispute-settlement method. The soundness of this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the provisions of the BIT were well known to the negotiators for both parties.\n\n56.\n\nRespondent also contends that even if the BIT is held to be applicable, its dispute-settlement mechanism under Article 8 can be invoked only by means of a joint submission of the dispute by the parties either to an ICSID arbitration tribunal or to a tribunal established under the UNCITRAL arbitration rules. Since Claimant has not sought ICSID arbitration jointly with Respondent, the latter submits that the requirements of Article 8 of the BIT have not been satisfied.\n\n57.\n\nRespondent\u2019s contention, which is based on its translation of the Czech and Slovak texts of Article 8, has been convincingly refuted by expert evidence presented by Claimant. The Tribunal also notes that in its last submission, Respondent itself admits that the wording of Article 8 is \"ambiguous.\" Moreover, a holding that the parties must submit their dispute to arbitration jointly would amount to a finding that the terms of Article 8 of the BIT, even if otherwise effective for purposes of ICSID jurisdiction, do not provide for binding arbitration unless the parties agree to arbitration if and when a dispute arises. As correctly pointed out by Claimant, such an interpretation would leave investors without the protection afforded by international arbitration, contrary to the main objective of bilateral investment treaties. The fact that some such treaties may contain provisions for joint submission of disputes to arbitration does not compel the conclusion that provisions whose wording is at best ambiguous must be interpreted in like manner. Such a construction of the terms of a treaty would be incompatible with the applicable international rules for the interpretation of these types of agreements. (Vienna Convention, art. 31(1).)\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, furthermore, that Article 8(3) of the BIT provides that whichever of the two dispute-settlement facilities envisaged under Article 8(2)\u2014ICSID or the UNCITRAL rules\u2014first receives a dispute shall resolve it. The language of this provision makes sense only if it is predicated on the assumption that each party to a dispute has the right separately to initiate the arbitration proceedings.\n\n59.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Tribunal holds that the parties have consented in the Consolidation Agreement to ICSID jurisdiction and that the date of such Agreement is, for all relevant purposes, the date of their consent. Since each party may separately institute the arbitration proceedings, Claimant was entitled to elect ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nIV. IS THERE A LEGAL DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF AN INVESTMENT?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal must now consider the objection raised by the Slovak Republic in which it challenges the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Tribunal\u2019s competence in this case on the ground that the dispute between the Parties is not a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n61.\n\nThe Slovak Republic stresses the political nature of the instant dispute and its close link with the dissolution of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, but it does not question the legal nature of the dispute. CBOS\u2019s claim is based on Article 3 of the Consolidation Agreement. The Tribunal must therefore analyze the rights and obligations set forth therein, as well as the question whether CSOB is entitled to damages due to the breach of the obligations alleged to have been committed by the Slovak Republic. CSOB does not seek a determination relating to the division of assets and liabilities between the two Republics, a subject expressly excluded from the scope of the BIT by its Article 11. While it is true that investment disputes to which a State is a party frequently have political elements or involve governmental actions, such disputes do not lose their legal character as long as they concern legal rights or obligations or the consequences of their breach. Given these considerations, the Tribunal is satisfied that CSOB\u2019s claim is legal in character.\n\n62.\n\nThe Slovak Republic bases its objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal on the ground that the dispute in the instant case is not related to an \"investment\" and, moreover, that it does not arise \"directly\" out of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n63.\n\nIt is common ground that the Convention does not define the term \"investment\" and that various proposals to define it during the drafting negotiations failed. This fact is reflected in the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank, which noted that:\n\n27. No attempt was made to define the term \"investment\" given the essential requirements of consent by the parties, and the mechanisms through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4)).13\n\n1 ICSID Rep. 28 (1993)\n\n64.\n\nThis statement also indicates that investment as a concept should be interpreted broadly because the drafters of the Convention did not impose any restrictions on its meaning. Support for a liberal interpretation of the question whether a particular transaction constitutes an investment is also found in the first paragraph of the Preamble to the Convention, which declares that \"the Contracting States [are] considering the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein.\" This language permits an inference that an international transaction which contributes to cooperation designed to promote the economic development of a Contracting State may be deemed to be an investment as that term is understood in the Convention.\n\n65.\n\nIt is worth noting, in this connection, that a Contracting State that wishes to limit the scope of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction can do so by making the declaration provided for in Article 25(4) of the Convention. The Slovak Republic has not made such a declaration and has, therefore, submitted itself broadly to the full scope of the subject matter jurisdiction governed by the Convention.\n\n66.\n\nIt follows that an important element in determining whether a dispute qualifies as an investment under the Convention in any given case is the specific consent given by the Parties. The Parties\u2019 acceptance of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the rights and obligations arising out of their agreement therefore creates a strong presumption that they considered their transaction to be an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal must accordingly attach considerable significance to the reference made in Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement to the BIT and thus to the ICSID arbitration clause contained therein (Article 8). The Parties\u2019 acceptance of the relevance and applicability of the BIT to the Consolidation Agreement expresses their view that the latter transaction relates to an investment within the meaning of the BIT. The contrary conclusion would deprive the reference to the BIT in Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement of its meaning or *effet utile.*\n\n68.\n\nThe Slovak Republic is correct in pointing out, however, that an agreement of the parties describing their transaction as an investment is not, as such, conclusive in resolving the question whether the dispute involves an investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention. The concept of an investment as spelled out in that provision is objective in nature in that the parties may agree on a more precise or restrictive definition of their acceptance of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, but they may not choose to submit disputes to the Centre that are not related to an investment. A two-fold test must therefore be applied in determining whether this Tribunal has the competence to consider the merits of the claim: whether the dispute arises out of an investment within the meaning of the Convention and, if so, whether the dispute relates to an investment as defined in the Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration, in their reference to the BIT and the pertinent definitions contained in Article 1 of the BIT.\n\n69.\n\nCSOB\u2019s claim is based on the allegation that the Slovak Republic breached its obligation under the Consolidation Agreement by failing and refusing to cover the losses incurred by the Slovak Collection Company. Viewed in isolation, this undertaking does not involve any spending, outlays or expenditure of resources by CSOB in the Slovak Republic. Standing alone, therefore, it does not constitute an investment.\n\n70.\n\nClaimant argues, however, that the loan made to the Slovak Collection Company qualifies as an investment and that the actual dispute is therefore within the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal. The Slovak Republic rejects the view that CSOB\u2019s loan is an investment and contends that the dispute does not arise directly out of the Loan Agreement. It submits that the dispute is concerned exclusively with the purported obligation of the Slovak Republic to cover the losses of the Slovak Collection Company.\n\n71.\n\nThe Slovak Republic\u2019s argument calls for an analysis of the meaning of the word \"directly\" as used in that part of Article 25(1) of the Convention which reads as follows: \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment,... Here it is relevant to note that in the *Fedax* case the Tribunal stated:\n\nIt is apparent that the term \"directly\" relates in this Article to the \"dispute\" and not to the \"investment\". It follows that jurisdiction can exist even in respect of investments that are not direct, so long as the dispute arises directly from such transaction. This interpretation is also consistent with the broad reach that the term \"investment\" must be given in the light of the negotiating history of the Convention.14\n\nFedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, July 11, 1997, 37 I.L.M. 1378, at para. 24 (1998).\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the interpretation adopted in the *Fedax* case. An investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation15 that qualifies as an investment.\n\n*See ibid.,* paras. 25 and 26, and cases cited therein.\n\n73.\n\nThe Preamble of the Convention confirms the foregoing interpretation. Here, after \"considering the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein,\" the Contracting Parties bear \"in mind the possibility that from time to time disputes may arise in connection with such investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States.\"\n\n74.\n\nThe foregoing analysis indicates that the term \"directly\", as used in Article 25(1) of the Convention, should not be interpreted restrictively to compel the conclusion that CSOB\u2019s claim is outside the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence merely because it is based on an obligation of the Slovak Republic which, standing alone, does not qualify as an investment.\n\n75.\n\nHence, in deciding whether the obligation referred to in CSOB\u2019s requested relief forms part of an investment, the Tribunal has to determine whether the purported obligation of the Slovak Republic forms an integral part of a transaction which qualifies as an investment. The Slovak Republic\u2019s undertaking to cover the losses incurred by the Slovak Collection Company is closely linked to the loan provided by CSOB pursuant to Article 3 of the Consolidation Agreement and the provisions of the Loan Agreement. This loan was basically designed to secure the refinancing of the Collection Company up to an amount corresponding to the payment by the Company of the value of the receivables assigned by CSOB on the basis of the schedule of payments covering the years 1995 to 2003. As stated in Article 3 of the Consolidation Agreement, it follows from the nature of the assigned receivables, which are qualified therein as \"non-performing\", that the Collection Company will incur a loss resulting from the operating costs of the Company and the schedule of payments, including interests, due to CSOB and the amounts eventually recovered from those described as \"non-performing\" debtors. The purpose of the Slovak Republic\u2019s obligation to cover the loss of the Collection Company is therefore to allow this Company to meet its obligation towards CSOB under the schedule of payments based on the Loan Agreement. Given this close link, the dispute arising out of the alleged breach of the Slovak Republic\u2019s obligation is closely related to the loan made by CSOB to the Slovak Collection Company.\n\n76.\n\nThe Slovak Republic submits that loans as such do not qualify as investments under Article 25(1) of the Convention, nor under Article 1 of the BIT. It contends further that the loan in the instant case is not an investment because it did not involve a transfer of resources in the territory of the Slovak Republic. As to the first point, the Tribunal considers that the broad meaning which must be given to the notion of an investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention is opposed to the conclusion that a transaction is not an investment merely because, as a matter of law, it is a loan. This is so, if only because under certain circumstances a loan may contribute substantially to a State\u2019s economic development. In this connection, Claimant correctly points out that other ICSID Tribunals have affirmed their competence to deal with the merits of claims based on loan agreements.16\n\nSee, *e.g.,* the *Fedax case,* paras. 22 and 29, *supra.*\n\n77.\n\nIn support of its conclusion that the CSOB loan qualifies as an investment under the BIT, Claimant points to Article 1(1), which reads in part as follows:\n\n1. \u2018Investment\u2019 shall mean any asset invested or obtained by an investor of one Party in the territory of the other Party in accordance with the laws of the other Party, including, without limitation:...\n\nc) monetary receivables or claims to any performance related to an investment;...\n\ne) any rights under an act or under any contract, license or permit issued under an act, including any concession to search for, cultivate or exploit natural resources.\n\nAlthough loans are not expressly mentioned in this list, terms as broad as \"assets\" and \"monetary receivables or claims\" clearly encompass loans extended to a Slovak entity by a national of the other Contracting Party. Loans as such are therefore not excluded from the notion of an investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT. It does not follow therefrom, however, that any loan and, in particular, the loan granted by CSOB to the Slovak Collection Company meets the requirements of an investment under Article 25(1) of the Convention or, for that matter, under Article 1(1) of the BIT, which speaks of an \"asset invested or obtained by an investor of one Party in the territory of the other Party\".\n\n78.\n\nThe Slovak Republic contends that the CSOB loan does not constitute an investment. It defines an investment essentially as the acquisition of property or assets through the expenditure of resources by one party (the \"investor\") in the territory of a foreign country (the \"host State\"), which is expected to produce a benefit on both sides and to offer a return in the future, subject to the uncertainties of the risk involved. While the Slovak Republic argues that the CSOB loan does not meet any elements of the above definition, CSOB submits that its loan qualifies as an investment thereunder. The Tribunal notes, in this connection, that while it is undisputed that CSOB\u2019s loan did not cause any funds to be moved or transferred from CSOB to the Slovak Collection Company in the territory of the Slovak Republic, a transaction can qualify as an investment even in the absence of a physical transfer of funds.17\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 41, *supra*\n\n79.\n\nClaimant argues that the loan provided the Slovak Collection Company with the funds necessary to settle the purchase price of the assigned receivables, and that these funds therefore represented an asset acquired by CSOB in the territory of the Slovak Republic. An analysis of the particular circumstances of this transaction indicates, however, that while CSOB\u2019s receivables against the Slovak Collection Company had a defined value, as determined in the loan agreement and the schedule of payments agreed upon by the Parties, these receivables had no corresponding value for the Slovak Collection Company. Indeed, the price to be paid by the Company to CSOB, that is, the return-payment of the advances received from CSOB under the loan facility, had a value far above the expected recovery from the collection of the assigned non-performing receivables. To that extent, CSOB\u2019s loan did not involve any spending or outlay of resources in the territory of the Slovak Republic.\n\n80.\n\nThe contractual scheme embodied in the Consolidation Agreement shows, however, that the CSOB loan to the Slovak Collection Company is closely related to and cannot be disassociated from all other transactions involving the restructuring of CSOB. As stated in the first part of Article 1, the Consolidation Agreement was designed to provide for \"the implementation of the project of the second phase of CSOB\u2019s transformation,\" and further:\n\nThis process shall consist primarily of a financial consolidation of CSOB in preparation for the future privatization of CSOB. The consolidation of CSOB shall involve the improvement of CSOB\u2019s balance by the disposal of non-performing assets of CSOB to such level as agreed herein.\n\nThose provisions of Article 1 that deal with the objects to be achieved show that the Agreement constituted the legal framework for a \"consolidation process\" consisting of several interrelated actions, as defined in the second part of Article 1 :\n\nThe following actions shall be taken as part of the consolidation process:\n\nI. An increase in the registered capital of CSOB;\n\nII. Improvement of the balance of CSOB, comprising:\n\n(a) the coverage of a part of the Non-Performing Assets of CSOB (as defined below) out of the profit and reserves;\n\n(b) the establishment of Collection Companies and the transfer of the Non-Performing Assets to such Collection Companies.\n\nIII. The privatization of CSOB.\n\nThe assignments of a part of CSOB\u2019s non-performing receivables to the respective Collection Company to be established in each Republic was thus an integral part of the whole process. This transfer improved CSOB\u2019s balance by crediting CSOB with payments equivalent to \"the nominal value of the assigned receivables, including any interest accrued until the time of the assignment\", whereas the Collection Company had to suffer the loss resulting \"from the nature of the assigned receivables.\" (Article 3.)\n\n81.\n\nThe sole or exclusive purpose of the CSOB loan was to ensure the refinancing by the Collection Company of CSOB. The loan facility was therefore a mere instrument in ensuring the payment by the Collection Company of the nominal value of the assigned receivables, which was part of the improvement of CSOB\u2019s balance. This close link is further evidenced by the fact that CSOB\u2019s loan to the Collection Companies is part of the Consolidation Agreement concluded between CSOB and the Republics. (Article 3.) Similarly, the Slovak Republic\u2019s undertaking to compensate its Collection Company for the losses made as a consequence of unsuccessful recoveries of the non-performing assets was instrumental to ensuring the refinancing of CSOB and thus to covering the payment of the assigned receivables up to their nominal value. This obligation of the Slovak Republic is also included in the terms of the Consolidation Agreement (Article 3) and referred to in Article 7 of the Loan Agreement.\n\n82.\n\nThe Slovak Republic\u2019s undertaking and the CSOB loan form an integrated whole in the process defined in the Consolidation Agreement. Hence, individual transactions comprising it may still meet the requirements of an investment under the Convention, provided the overall operation for the consolidation of CSOB, to which it is closely connected, qualifies as an investment.\n\n83.\n\nThe basic feature of the Consolidation Agreement was not the financial consolidation of CSOB as such, but the development of the role and activities of CSOB in both Republics. When considering the implementation of the second phase of CSOB\u2019s transformation, the parties to the Agreement referred to:\n\nThe special position and role of CSOB in managing the central foreign exchange source for both Republics and in performing foreign banking transactions, and the extraordinary role that CSOB plays in the economy of both Republics.... (Article 1.)\n\nThe second phase was to render CSOB more attractive to potential new shareholders from the private sector and thus prepare for the future privatization of CSOB. The ultimate goal of this process was to enable CSOB to exercise fully its role and to develop its activities in both Republics within the framework of a market economy.\n\n84.\n\nThe Slovak Republic is correct in submitting that both Republics undertook to initiate this process and to ensure the capital increase of CSOB as well as the funding necessary to cover the losses of the Collection Companies and, consequently, the refinancing of CSOB. These important financial contributions to the benefit of CSOB are not investments within the meaning of the Convention, for they do not involve investments made in a Contracting State by a national of another Contracting State. This conclusion does not, however, resolve the issue whether or not CSOB qualifies as an \"investor\" under the Consolidation Agreement. To answer that question, the Tribunal must focus on CSOB\u2019s role in achieving the ultimate goal of the Agreement, irrespective of whether or not the funds required to allow CSOB to exercise this role were provided by the Republics.\n\n85.\n\nThe function attributed to CSOB in the Consolidation Agreement was, as stated in the heading of Article 5, the \"Development of CSOB in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic\". According to the first sentence of this provision, \"[t]he development of CSOB in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic shall reflect the needs of the Company and the interest of the shareholders in maximizing the value of CSOB.\" This development was designed to improve what Article 1 qualifies as \"the extraordinary role that CSOB plays in the economy of both Republics.\"\n\n86.\n\nThe drafting history of the Consolidation Agreement shows that the Slovak Republic wished to ensure that CSOB would maintain and extend its activities on its territory. This conclusion finds support in the Slovak insistence on this point during the negotiations of the Agreement:\n\nThe Slovak party demands guarantees of sound development of CSOB in the Slovak Republic, and makes the compensation of the collection company\u2019s losses conditional upon the honoring of such guarantees.18\n\nMinutes of Interdepartmental Discussion of the Project of CSOB\u2019s Restructuring as Part of the Preparation for CSOB\u2019s Privatization on October 21, 1993.\n\n87.\n\nThe Consolidation Agreement provides basically for the development of CSOB\u2019s activities in both Republics. A particular consideration was given to CSOB\u2019s role in the Slovak Republic in two respects. First, pursuant to the last sentence of Article 5, the Czech National Bank (CNB), in consultation with the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic, \"shall enable CSOB to develop business in the Slovak Republic in line with the above principle by issuing a general foreign-exchange licence\". Second, the parties provide in Article 6 for the establishment of a CSOB subsidiary domiciled in the Slovak Republic that would take over the entire range of banking services provided by the CSOB branch network in the Slovak Republic and enable CSOB to reduce its equity interest below 50%. Although this subsidiary has not as yet been created, there can be no doubt that the parties intended to strengthen CSOB as a leading entity in the Slovak banking sector. Since the Loan Agreement was concluded by CSOB\u2019s branch in Bratislava, CSOB\u2019s accounts receivable were recorded in the accounting books of that branch. They were to be paid in Slovak currency and constituted a working asset designed to enable CSOB to engage in business activities through its Slovak branches.\n\n88.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the basic and ultimate goal of the Consolidation Agreement was to ensure a continuing and expanding activity of CSOB in both Republics. This undertaking involved a significant contribution by CSOB to the economic development of the Slovak Republic; it qualified CSOB as an investor and the entire process as an investment in the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the Convention. This is evident from the fact that CSOB\u2019s undertakings include the spending or outlays of resources in the Slovak Republic in response to the need for the development of the Republic\u2019s banking infrastructure.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, moreover, that the requirements spelled out in Article 1(1) of the BIT for a qualifying investment are also met in the instant case. This must have been the view of the parties when they accepted a reference to the BIT in Article 7 of the Consolidation Agreement. The contrary conclusion would deprive this reference to the BIT of any meaning *{cf.* para. 67). Furthermore, CSOB\u2019s activity in the Slovak Republic and its undertaking to ensure a sound banking infrastructure in that country compel the conclusion that CSOB qualifies as the holder of an \"asset invested or obtained\" in the territory of the Slovak Republic within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT, including \"movable and immovable property and any other encumbrances, including any mortgages, liens, guarantees, and similar rights\" (Art. 1(1) (a)) and \"monetary receivables or claims to any performance related to an investment\" (Art. 1(1)(c)).\n\n90.\n\nFinally, applying the definition of an investment proffered by the Slovak Republic (para. 78, *supra),* it would seem that the resources provided through CSOB\u2019s banking activities in the Slovak Republic were designed to produce a benefit and to offer CSOB a return in the future, subject to an element of risk that is implicit in most economic activities. The Tribunal notes, however, that these elements of the suggested definition, while they tend as a rule to be present in most investments, are not a formal prerequisite for the finding that a transaction constitutes an investment as that concept is understood under the Convention.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, accordingly, that CSOB\u2019s claim and the related loan facility made available to the Slovak Collection Company are closely connected to the development of CSOB\u2019s banking activity in the Slovak Republic and that they qualify as investments within the meaning of the Convention and the BIT.\n\nV. DECISION\n-----------\n\n92.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides that this dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal will issue the necessary Order for the continuation of the proceedings on the merits."}, {"Title": "Decision of the Tribunal on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2000-12-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the Tribunal on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 24 May 1999 this Tribunal rendered a first decision on jurisdiction (hereinafter, the \"First Decision\"), holding that the parties had consented in the Consolidation Agreement to ICSID jurisdiction and that, accordingly, the dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n2.\n\nThe First Decision describes the contractual arrangements between the parties, the object of the dispute and the procedural steps taken prior thereto. The terms, as defined therein, shall have the same meaning when used in this Decision.\n\n3.\n\nAfter the First Decision was rendered, the parties filed the following memorials within the time limits fixed by the Tribunal:\n\nClaimant: Memorial on the Merits, dated November 15, 1999;\n\nRespondent: Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction under ICSID Rule 41, dated December 23, 1999;\n\nClaimant: Observations on the Slovak Republic\u2019s Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction, dated February 7, 2000;\n\nRespondent: Reply to Claimant\u2019s Observations on the Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction, dated March 7, 2000;\n\nClaimant: Rejoinder to the Slovak Republic\u2019s Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction, dated March 21, 2000.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 17, 2000, the Tribunal held a meeting at which the parties presented oral arguments regarding the Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction raised by Respondent.\n\nII. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITION\n-------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe respective positions of the parties, based on their written and oral submissions, are summarized below.\n\nA. Respondent\u2019s position\n------------------------\n\n6.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimant\u2019s submission on the merits improperly attempts to have this Tribunal resolve a broad range of highly factual issues arising exclusively under agreements that lack an arbitration clause and involve only private parties. Specifically, Respondent contends that many of the issues raised by Claimant do not arise under the Consolidation Agreement, but under the Loan Agreement and other contracts to which the Slovak Republic is not a party. Respondent further submits that such other agreements, which it describes collectively as the \"CSOB/SI Agreements\", did not serve as the basis for Claimant\u2019s claims as set out in its Request for Arbitration since their scope was restricted to claims arising under the Consolidation Agreement. Respondent adds that these agreements were not the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional determination, and are currently the subject of proceedings in the Slovak courts.\n\n7.\n\nSince Claimant has submitted 12 volumes of supporting materials with its Memorial on the Merits, accompanied by 22 boxes of accounting documents, Respondent considers it essential that the proceeding on the merits be suspended and a decision be rendered as to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction relating to the issues raised by the CSOB/SI Agreements.\n\n8.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s position that Claimant should not be allowed to surreptitiously extend the scope of this arbitration beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. It obtained jurisdiction only with regard to the Consolidation Agreement because an ICSID arbitration clause was held to have been incorporated by reference into that agreement. According to Respondent, therefore, the Tribunal cannot be deemed to have jurisdiction to decide disputes arising under the CSOB/SI Agreements, since they differ significantly in a variety of respects from the Consolidation Agreement.\n\n9.\n\nIn further amplification of its objection to jurisdiction, Respondent emphasizes that:\n\ni) The Slovak Republic is party to the Consolidation Agreement, but not to any of the CSOB/SI Agreements to which only SI is a party;\n\nii) Czech law and the BIT govern the Consolidation Agreement, while Slovak law governs the CSOB/SI Agreements;\n\niii) None of the CSOB/SI Agreements contains an arbitration clause, which suggests that, according to the applicable rules of private\n\ninternational law, Slovak courts have jurisdiction to resolve disputes arising under these agreements. One of them in fact contains an express reference to *\"the court of competent jurisdiction\"* and not to arbitration;\n\niv) The First Decision emphasized the relationship between the Loan Agreement and the Consolidation Agreement for the purposes of determining whether the dispute arose directly out of an investment. It did not do so for the purpose of determining the existence of consent by either party to arbitration or the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae-,*\n\nv) In determining that *\"this dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre\"* (First Decision, paragraph 92), the *\"dispute\"* is necessarily defined by reference to the claims before the Tribunal, which were all brought under the Consolidation Agreement.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that, notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s holding in its First Decision, Claimant seeks an award of sums due it from SI under the Loan Agreement, Si\u2019s indebtedness thereunder being supported by Respondent\u2019s undertaking under the Consolidation Agreement to cover Si\u2019s losses. That undertaking is characterized by Claimant\u2019s legal expert, Professor Jan Didi\u00e8, as a \"comfort letter\" according to which Respondent would have secured the debtor\u2019s (Si\u2019s) obligations. It constitutes, therefore, a second-tier obligation in respect of Si\u2019s first-tier obligation to repay its debt to Claimant under the CSOB/SI Agreements. Respondent submits that only when the courts competent to resolve the disputes arising out of the first-tier obligations have done so, will there be a liquidated amount of losses capable of constituting the subject matter of the second-tier obligation, which is the subject of this arbitration.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent submits that it is a generally accepted principle that an arbitration clause contained in a guarantee does not extend to the primary contract. The same is deemed to be true the other way round, that is, when the clause in question is found in the primary contract and not in the guarantee. According to the Respondent, this Tribunal has jurisdiction only with regard to disputes under the Consolidation Agreement, namely, the Agreement which stipulates the second-tier obligation, and does not extend to disputes under the agreements that govern the first-tier obligation. In the instant case, these are the Loan Agreement and the other CSOB/SI Agreements. Respondent therefore rejects the proposition that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the indebtedness of SI to CSOB because those issues arise solely under the CSOB/SI Agreements.\n\n12.\n\nRespondent contends further that in the present case there was no consent for the submission to ICSID arbitration of issues arising under the CSOB/SI Agreements. It founds this argument on the proposition that the determination of the Tribunal that the arbitration clause contained in Article 8 of the BIT was incorporated by reference into the Consolidation Agreement and cannot be construed as extending to the CSOB/SI Agreements or to any other contract. According to this view, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends to issues involving the Slovak Republic that arise under the Consolidation Agreement and includes jurisdiction to award damages. It does not, however, apply to the determination of amounts owed by SI to CSOB under the CSOB/SI Agreements. This conclusion, according to Respondent, gains further support from the fact that, since SI is a national of the Slovak State, the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over such an entity.\n\n13.\n\nIn conclusion, while reserving its right to seek the annulment of any subsequent award on the merits on the ground that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in the First Decision, Respondent submits that, while the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide issues arising under the Consolidation Agreement, including the existence and nature of the parties\u2019 obligations thereunder, only the Slovak courts are competent to determine the existence and amount of Si\u2019s debt to CSOB under the CSOB/SI Agreements.\n\nB. Claimant\u2019s position\n----------------------\n\n14.\n\nClaimant submits that it claimed, both in the Request for Arbitration and in its Memorial on the merits, that the Slovak Republic violated the Consolidation Agreement and that Claimant was entitled therefore to the remedies afforded by Czech law in such circumstances, including damages. Accordingly, Claimant contends that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is not limited to the determination of Respondent\u2019s breach of the Consolidation Agreement and the resulting liability for damages, but that it also extends to the determination of the amount of damages. This result has its basis in the principles of effectiveness and finality applicable to the matter of jurisdiction as indicated by the practice of the International Court of Justice.\n\n15.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the scope of the consent to ICSID jurisdiction given under Article 25 (I) of the Convention must be determined by reference to the good faith intentions of the parties and the economic realities of the contemplated transaction. It follows that when such a transaction is to be consummated through a series of separate agreements, or is to be executed through a special purpose entity, ICSID tribunals have held that they have jurisdiction to address issues arising under those related agreements. This has been the case even where such related agreements did not contain separate consents to ICSID jurisdiction and when they were concluded between parties other than, but related to, the parties to the arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nIn support of its position, Claimant refers to the many cases decided by ICSID tribunals which exercise jurisdiction over issues arising not only under the agreement containing the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID jurisdiction, but also under other contracts concluded to carry out the contemplated investment. In rendering these decisions, the ICSID tribunals relied on the overall unity or inseparability of the relevant operation.1 Claimant asserts further that its position finds support also in the caselaw of other non-ICSID tribunals. They based their jurisdiction to rule on issues arising under contracts related to the primary contract, which contained the parties\u2019 consent to arbitration, whenever the related contracts defined the scope of obligations arising under the primary contract.\n\n*Holidays Inns* v. *Morocco,* as commented by P.

Arb. 71 (1985)\n\n17.\n\nClaimant further contends that this Tribunal has already recognized that its claims necessarily concern the entire transaction contemplated by Article 3 of the Consolidation Agreement, and that the CSOB/SI Agreements, which were designed to implement the Consolidation Agreement, are central to a determination of the scope of the rights and obligations of the Parties under that Agreement. Claimant submits that the principle that international proceedings take precedence over national court proceedings requires the exercise of ICSID jurisdiction to the exclusion of proceedings in Slovak national courts, and that the decisions of such courts concerning matters subject to ICSID jurisdiction are not binding on this Tribunal, which must render its own independent decision.\n\n18.\n\nClaimant submits next that the evidence in this case demonstrates that the only interpretation of the Consolidation Agreement that *\"takes into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged\"2* is one that would extend this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to the determination not only of the existence of Respondent\u2019s obligation but also of the precise amount of that obligation, instead of leaving the latter determination to the Slovak courts. This evidence is said to be reflected in the history of the negotiations leading to the Consolidation Agreement. Here the Slovak Republic itself referred to this Agreement as a *\"master agreement\"*. The evidence is also to be found in the subsidiary agreement where the Slovak Minister of Finance confirms the obligations assumed by Respondent with regard to the Consolidation Agreement. The numerous cross references in the text of the subsidiary agreements to the Consolidation Agreement as well as the conduct of the parties subsequent to the conclusion of these agreements are said to further support Claimant\u2019s conclusion.\n\nFirst Decision, paragraph 34 (quoting *AMCO Asia et al. v. Indonesia,* Decision on Jurisdiction of Sept. 25, 1983, 23 LL.M. 359 (1984)).\n\n19.\n\nIn reliance on the caselaw of the International Court of Justice, Claimant contends that when a tribunal has been seized of a dispute arising under an instrument over which it has jurisdiction, it is deemed to be competent to address secondary or incidental questions relating to other instruments, provided this is necessary in order to adjudicate the dispute over which it has jurisdiction. According to Claimant, the instant case is in fact such a case because the Consolidation Agreement defines Respondent\u2019s obligation in terms of Si\u2019s liability under the subsidiary agreements. It is Claimant\u2019s position that its claims are against Respondent and not SI, and that they arise under the Consolidation Agreement, rather than the implementing or subsidiary agreements.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant further submits that the absence of dispute resolution clauses in the implementing agreements demonstrates that the parties to these agreements considered such provisions unnecessary because the Consolidation Agreement contained the requisite arbitration clause. In this connection, Claimant suggests that questions concerning the intention of the parties regarding whether or nor they agreed to arbitration are routinely evaluated by reference to agreements at issue in other cases with similar elements. Previous ICSID decisions are thus relevant in deciding comparable issues in this case.\n\n21.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserts that it is consistent with the obligation of Article 48 (3) of the ICSID Convention that the Tribunal\u2019s award deal with every issue submitted to it. In the present case the dispute under the Consolidation Agreement raises two principal issues, namely, (i) whether Respondent breached its obligation to cover Si\u2019s losses as contemplated by the Consolidation Agreement, and (ii) what are the damages to which Claimant is entitled under that Agreement as a consequence of such a breach. Since the dispute submitted to this Tribunal covers the transactions described in the Consolidation Agreement, Claimant submits that it is necessary for the Tribunal to examine the agreements contemplated therein. Hence, according to Claimant, this Tribunal has the requisite jurisdiction over the dispute and should reject Respondent\u2019s latest jurisdictional challenge.\n\nIII. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS\n-----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThis further challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the arguments advanced by the parties make it necessary for the Tribunal to spell out the precise scope of the jurisdictional determination it made in the First Decision. In this connection, the Tribunal recalls that in paragraph 92 of the First Decision it ruled that \"...this dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal...\"\n\n23.\n\nClaimant is correct in asserting that the reference in the First Decision to \"this dispute\" applies to the manner in which the Claimant has presented its claims. In its Request for Arbitration, Claimant requested that a final award be issued\n\n*\"(a) Declaring that the Slovak Republic without legal justification has breached its obligations to CSOB under the Consolidation Agreement by failing and refusing to cover losses made by the Slovak Collection Company;*\n\n(b) Requiring the Slovak Republie to fulfil its obligations to CSOB under the Consolidation Agreement to cover fosses made by the Slovak Collection Company in an amount sufficient to discharge its debt to CSOB;\n\n(c) Granting to CSOB any and all of the damages suffered by it as a result of the Slovak Republic\u2019s failure and refusal to fulfil its obligations to CSOB under the Consolidation Agreement to cover fosses made by the Slovak Collection Company; and\n\n*(d) Granting to CSOB all of the costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator\u2019s fees and the administrative costs fixed by ICSID, the expenses of the arbitrators, the fees and expenses of any experts, and the legal costs incurred by the parties (including fees of counsel)\".*\n\nThe Tribunal confirms its jurisdiction regarding the dispute as so framed by Claimant to the extent that the same arises under the Consolidation Agreement and is to be settled according to its provisions, including its governing law clause.\n\n24.\n\nThe relief requested by Claimant in its Memorial on the merits reads as follows:\n\n\"For the reasons stated above, CSOB respectfully requests the Tribunal to award it as compensation for the damages it has incurred due to the Slovak Republic\u2019s breach of the Consolidation Agreement the following:\n\n1. The sum of SKK 24,659,907.271, being equal to the principal and interest due to June 30, 2000 under the SI Loan Agreement;\n\n2. The sum of SKK 9,064,537.958, being the additional fosses of CSOB it may claim pursuant to Section 379 *et seq.* of the Commercial Code of the Czech Republic, measured by the Slovak Government bond yield to June 30, 2000;\n\n3. The additional sums due when the damages under 1 and 2 above are carried forward from June 30, 2000 to the date of the award to be issued in this case;\n\n4. Such additional sums as may be calculated and submitted to the Tribunal prior to the closure of this proceeding representing CSOB\u2019s further damages, including lost productive management time and professional fees and expenses incurred relating to\n\na. all proceedings relating to Si\u2019s bankruptcy;\n\nb. obtaining, documenting, implementing and maintaining Czech shareholder financial support of the Bank;\n\nc. this proceeding; and\n\nd. otherwise asserting its rights under the Consolidation Agreement;\n\n5. interest at a rate (or rates) to be determined on all sums awarded from the date of the award until the date it is paid.\"\n\n25.\n\nThe determination of the precise scope of its jurisdiction as established by the Tribunal in its First Decision must be made by reference to the consent of the parties to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal\u2019s decision on this subject will be guided by the principles set out in paragraph 34 of the First Decision, which reads as follows:\n\n\"In determining how to interpret agreements to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is guided by an ICSID decision which held that\n\na convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively,* nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly* or *liberally.* It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties.... Moreover,...any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\" (Emphasis supplied)]\n\n26.\n\nAfter full consideration of the arguments and authorities submitted by the parties, the Tribunal concludes that an analysis of what may be deemed to be *\"the common will of the parties\"*, as that phrase is used in paragraph 34, indicates that the Tribunal was not granted jurisdiction also with respect to the CSOB/SI Agreements.\n\n27.\n\nIn reaching the foregoing conclusion, the Tribunal notes, in the first place, that each case must be assessed by reference to its specific facts. Unlike the prior cases to which Claimant has referred, the parties in the instant case have not provided for a separate and express dispute resolution clause. The Tribunal did find, however, that the reference to the BIT in the Consolidation Agreement constituted an incorporation by reference into the Consolidation Agreement of Article 8 of the BIT which provides for international arbitration. This conclusion, while fully justified as an interpretation of the common will of the parties, imposes a measure of restraint on the Tribunal when it is called upon to identify, once again by a process of interpretation, what types of disputes the parties actually intended to have covered by their arbitration agreement.\n\n28.\n\nIn the First Decision, the Tribunal has held that the CSOB\u2019s claim and the related loan facility made available to SI qualify as investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT (paragraph 91). This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal thereby automatically acquires jurisdiction with regard to each agreement concluded to implement the wider investment operation. Other requirements have to be met for such jurisdiction to be established. That is, the fact that the agreement to arbitrate referred to in the First Decision must be construed in good faith does not necessarily mean that the interpretation of the consent of the parties under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention must in each case be deemed to extend to any and all agreements comprising the entire transaction.\n\n29.\n\nIn the instant case, there are good reasons that militate against extending the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate beyond the Consolidation Agreement. The CSOB/SI Agreements have not been signed by the same entities which are parties to the Consolidation Agreement. Moreover, national courts have shown considerable restraint in extending the reach of an arbitration agreement beyond the signatories\u2019 sphere. In taking this position, these courts have relied on the principle of the relative effects of a contract *(tertio \u00f1eque nocet \u00f1eque prodest)* as well as on the contractual basis of arbitration as a dispute resolution method.3\n\nCohen D., *Arbitrage et Groupes de Contrats,* Rev. Arb. 1997, p. 502\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the contention that the absence of an arbitration clause in the CSOB/SI Agreements supports the conclusion that the parties thereto considered the arbitration agreement of the Consolidation Agreement to be applicable also to disputes between them. The absence of such a clause may in fact be deemed to reflect the intent to leave the resolution of disputes to the competent national courts. In this respect, it is significant that one of these agreements, viz., the Agreement to Conclude Future Agreements on the Assignment of Certain Receivables Under Off-Balance Sheet Instruments between CSOB and SI (Article III), makes a specific reference to *\"a court of competent jurisdiction\".*\n\n31.\n\nThe principle of effectiveness and finality of jurisdiction, invoked by Claimant with reference to the practice of the International Court of Justice, cannot override the basic rule that arbitral jurisdiction is based on the consent of the parties. Moreover, this Tribunal lacks competence *ratione personae* to decide with *res judicata* effect issues arising out of the CSOB/SI Agreements. This is so because, on the one hand, SI is not bound by an agreement to submit disputes arising under these Agreements to ICSID jurisdiction and is not a party to the dispute pending before this Tribunal. On the other hand, Respondent is not a party to the CSOB/SI Agreement\n\n32.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal confirms its First Decision and holds that its competence covers, and is confined to, issues arising out of the Consolidation Agreement.\n\n33.\n\nFor the guidance of the parties in the merits phase of these proceedings, the Tribunal reiterates that it has jurisdiction to determine the validity, nature and scope of Respondent\u2019s obligation to cover Si\u2019s losses as provided by Article 3(11) of the Consolidation Agreement, to establish whether Respondent has breached that obligation, and to assess damages, if any, payable by Respondent to CSOB for any such breach.\n\n34.\n\nAccording to paragraph 61 of the First Decision, CSOB\u2019s claim based on Article 3 of the Consolidation Agreement requests the Tribunal to analyze the rights and obligations set forth therein, as well as the question whether CSOB is entitled to damages due to the breach of the obligations alleged to have been committed by the Slovak Republic. In Article 3(11) of the Consolidation Agreement, the Slovak Republic undertook to cover Si\u2019s losses resulting from the operating costs and the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned by CSOB to SI, including payment of interest. The more concise wording of Section 7 of the Loan Agreement provides that \"the repayment of the loan including interest thereof is secured by an obligation of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\". At the bottom of that Agreement, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its obligation under Section 7, which refers expressly to the Consolidation Agreement as the legal basis for the Ministry\u2019s undertaking.\n\n35.\n\nIt follows that if the determination of Si\u2019s losses and the amount of Si\u2019s indebtedness to CSOB were to be left to the national courts, as contended by Respondent, the determination of the amount of the Republic\u2019s alleged obligation to secure the repayment of the loan would be excluded from the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in the Consolidation Agreement and, hence, also from the competence of this Tribunal. The ICSID Convention does not require an ICSID tribunal to accept the binding effect of national court decisions. By contrast, Article 26 of the Convention states that \"[c]onsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy\". The Tribunal\u2019s competence must include, therefore, the determination of the Slovak Republic\u2019s obligation, if any, to secure the repayment of CSOB\u2019s loan, as well as, the amount of CSOB\u2019s damages, if any, due to the breach of that obligation. This competence, as recognized by Article 26 of the Convention, is exclusive of any other remedy. Accordingly, Slovak national courts may not retain jurisdiction over issues arising under the Consolidation Agreement.\n\nIV. DECISION\n------------\n\n36.\n\nFor all the above reasons, the Tribunal unanimously rejects the Slovak Republic\u2019s Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction under ICSID Rule 41, and decides to continue the proceedings on the merits pursuant to a pleading schedule to be fixed in due course."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I.** Introduction\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this case is the Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka A.S. (hereinafter \"CSOB\"), a commercial bank organized under Czech law; the Respondent is the Slovak Republic. CSOB filed its \"Request for Arbitration\" with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\" or \"Centre\") on April 18, 1997, charging the Slovak Republic with a breach of the Agreement on the Basic Principles of a Financial Consolidation of Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka dated December 17, 1993 (hereinafter the \"Consolidation Agreement\"), that was concluded between the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic and CSOB. CSOB alleged that the breach consisted in the failure of the Slovak Republic to cover the losses incurred by the Slovensk\u00e1 inkasn\u00e1 spol. s.r.o. (the Slovak Collection Company), as agreed to in the Consolidation Agreement and claimed dam- ages for the losses sustained, plus costs. The Request was registered by the Centre on April 25, 1997.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), the Tribunal was deemed constituted and the proceedings to have begun on August 20, 1997, the date on which the Parties were notified by the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID that Professor Andreas Bucher, appointed by CSOB, Professor Piero Bernardini, appointed by the Slovak Republic, and Professor Thomas Buergenthal, designated as President of the Tribunal by the Centre, had accepted their appointments. On that date, the Acting Secretary-General also informed the Parties that Ms. Margrete Stevens, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nOn 24 May 1999, the Tribunal rendered a first decision on jurisdiction (hereinafter the \"First Decision on Jurisdiction\"),1 holding that the Parties had consented in the Consolidation Agreement to ICSID jurisdiction and that, accordingly, the dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n14 *ICSID Review, Foreign Investment Law Journal,* at 251 (1999).\n\n4.\n\nOn December 23, 1999, the Slovak Republic filed a Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.\n\n5.\n\nAfter having heard the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions on this Request, the Tribunal, on December 1, 2000, rendered its Decision on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction (hereinafter the \"Second Decision on Jurisdiction\").2 In this Decision, the Tribunal confirmed its jurisdiction regarding the dispute as framed by CSOB to the extent that the same arises under the Consolidation Agreement and is to be settled according to its provisions, including its governing law clause. On February 20, 2001, the Tribunal informed the Parties that further directions, as they had been requested by the Slovak Republic on February 12, 2001, were not necessary to enable the Slovak Republic to proceed with its defense; the Tribunal therefore concluded that it had nothing to add to its Second Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n15 *ICSID Review, Foreign Investment Law Journal,* at 530 (2000).\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated October 4, 2001, Judge Thomas Buergenthal confirmed his decision to resign as President of the Tribunal. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding was suspended until the vacancy had been filled.\n\n7.\n\nIn a joint letter dated December 3, 2001, both Parties requested that the Centre appoint Professor Hans van Houtte to replace Judge Buergenthal on the Tribunal. By letter dated December 11, 2001, the Centre informed the Parties that Professor van Houtte had accepted his appointment and that, accordingly, the Tribunal was deemed to have been reconstituted and the proceedings to have resumed as of that date.\n\n8.\n\nAfter the First Decision on Jurisdiction had been rendered and the merits phase of these proceedings opened for the presentation of written submissions, the Parties filed the following memorials, together with supporting documentation, within the time limits fixed by the Tribunal:\n\nCSOB: Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, dated November 15.1999;3\n\nSlovak Republic: The Slovak Republic's Counter Memorial, dated April 19.2001 ;\n\nCSOB: Claimant's Reply, dated August 31, 2001;\n\nSlovak Republic: The Slovak Republic's Rejoinder, dated February 28, 2002.\n\nThis Memorial was re-submitted on February 15, 2000, including corrections to the Expert Report of Timothy H. Hart (Arthur Andersen) submitted January 20.2000.\n\n9.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 6 dated February 16, 2001, the Tribunal granted, with modifications, the Slovak Republic's request for the production of documents by CSOB. A set of documents was filed by the CSOB on March 12, 2001. In its Procedural Order No. 7 dated October 14, 2002, the Tribunal confirmed that Procedural Order No. 6 continued to govern the production of documents, including the denial of the Slovak Republic's request for production of documents relating to the finances and performance of Ceska inkasni s.r.o.; the Tribunal ruled therefore that in respect of the latter category of materials, it considered irrelevant documents and paragraphs whose removal from the file had been requested by the Slovak Republic and would not take them into account, without, however, ordering that such documents and paragraphs were to be actually removed from the files already submitted.\n\n10.\n\nOn October 1, 2002, the Tribunal held a meeting at the Centre in Washington, D.C. that dealt with procedural issues regarding the conduct of the first oral hearing on the merits to be held on November 8-12, 2002.\n\n11.\n\nThe first oral hearing on the merits was held on November 8-12, 2002 in Prague, at a venue agreed by the Parties. The hearing of witnesses and experts, followed by the Parties\u2019 respective pleadings, was recorded and documented by a transcript (hereinafter \"TR, November 2002\").\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the first oral hearing held in Prague, the Parties filed on January 31, 2003 the following submissions, within the time limit fixed by the Tribunal:\n\nCSOB's Post Hearing Submission on Issues Addressed at the Hearing of November 812, 2002;\n\nThe Slovak Republic's First Post Hearing Memorial.\n\n13.\n\nThe second oral hearing on the merits was equally held in Prague, as agreed by the Parties. It took place on April 14-18, 2003. The hearing of witnesses and experts, followed by the Parties\u2019 respective pleadings, was again recorded and documented by a transcript (hereinafter \"TR, April 2003\").\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the second oral hearing on the merits, the Parties filed the following submissions, within the time limits fixed by the Tribunal:\n\nOn June 20, 2003: CSOB's Post Hearing Submission on Issues Addressed at the Hearing of April 14-18, 2003; The Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial;\n\nOn July 18, 2003: CSOB's Reply to the Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial; The Slovak Republic's Third Post Hearing Memorial.\n\nOn June 20, 2003, the Slovak Republic further filed a brief under the title \"The Slovak Republic's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\", to which CSOB submitted a Reply on July 18, 2003.\n\n15.\n\nUpon the invitation by the Tribunal, the Parties submitted on October 18, 2004 an update of the quotations of the inter-bank rates on three-months loans (BRIBOR).\n\n16.\n\nOn October 29, 2004, each Party submitted a statement of costs incurred or borne by it in this proceeding and on November 15, 2004, each Party made comments on the other Party's statement.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated November 19, 2004, the Parties were informed that the proceeding had been closed.\n\n**II.** Background of the Dispute\n---------------------------------\n\nA. CSOB\u2019s Privatisation\n-----------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn the early 1990s, banks in Central and Eastern Europe had great difficulty remaining solvent and competitive as their markets evolved from state-run economies to private market economies. In order to remain viable, they needed restructuring. Most state-owned banks thus became subject to privatisation processes in their respective countries.\n\n19.\n\nThe present dispute relates to the privatisation of one such bank, CSOB, the Foreign Trade Bank of the former Czeskoslovak Republic, that changed its name to the \"Czech and Slovak Federal Republic\" in 1990. After this Republic was dissolved in December 31, 1992, CSOB remained active in the succeeding Czech and Slovak Republics.\n\n20.\n\nIn 1992, with a view to future privatisation, the Czech and Slovak Republics had begun the restructuring of CSOB. In fact, the restructuring of CSOB was the first of several restructuring operations of former Czechoslovak state-owned banks so as to prepare them for privatisation.\n\n21.\n\nAt the end of 1992, after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the succeeding Czech and Slovak Republics had become involved in the restructuring of CSOB. Both Republics became shareholders of CSOB which was pursuing its activity in the territory of both States.4\n\nThe main shareholders of CSOB were the Czech National Bank (26.51%) and the National Bank of Slovakia (24.13%), the Czech Ministry of Finance and the Czech National Property Fund (each 19.59%), as well as private shareholders (10.18%).\n\nB. The Three Phases of the Restructuring and Privatisation Process\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe restructuring and privatisation process was organized in three phases:\n\n23.\n\nDuring the first phase, which was initiated under the Federal Czechoslovak Government, non-performing state-related assets and liabilities from CSOB were transferred to the Czech and Slovak Republics at the ratio of 2:1, reflecting the respective population of both successor states. As of January 1, 1993, the central foreign exchange resources and the assets and liabilities of non-convertible currencies were transferred to the Czech and Slovak Republics at the same ratio of 2:1. Problems connected with foreign exchange assets and liabilities of state character within CSOB\u2019s balance were thus resolved and CSOB was relinquished from its former role as the Government\u2019s financier of foreign trade.\n\n24.\n\nDuring the second phase, CSOB\u2019s forthcoming privatisation came under preparation. It was contemplated that such privatisation would take place within two to four years. This phase included, *inter alia,* the increase of the registered capital of CSOB; the establishment of a Czech and Slovak Collection Company to whom non-performing receivables of CSOB would be transferred; and the establishment of a CSOB subsidiary in the Slovak Republic. To implement the second stage of the restructuring, the Consolidation Agreement (abbreviated \"CA\") was concluded between the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter the \"MF CR\"); the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the \"MF SR\"); and CSOB. The Czech National Bank, the National Property Fund of the Czech Republic and the National Bank of Slovakia declared their consent to this Agreement. Contrary to the later restructuring of other Czech and Slovak banks, where restructuring assets were written down to the real value, CSOB\u2019s assets were maintained at nominal value and non-performing assets were replaced by performing receivables.\n\n25.\n\nThe third and final phase of CSOB\u2019s transformation was its privatisation. This privatisation would require that at least 51% of the remaining state participation in CSOB were sold to one strategic investor. In 1997, the actual privatisation of CSOB was undertaken. CSOB was subsequently privatised in 1999 when the Czech State shareholders *(i.e.* the Czech National Property Fund, the Czech Ministry of Finance, and the Czech National Bank) as well as the National Bank of Slovakia sold their shares to KBC, a Belgian bank.\n\n26.\n\nThe restructuring and privatisation of CSOB has been profitable to both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Before the restructuring, the privatisation of CSOB would have been difficult and not very lucrative. The Tribunal notes that the Slovak Republic contributed an amount of Czech Crowns 1,055 million to the increase of CSOB\u2019s capital. CSOB claims that the Slovak Republic undertook a commitment to cover the losses incurred by the Slovak Collection Company and that its obligation to cover these losses amounted to SKK 13,523,712.976. In this Award the Tribunal will analyze whether indeed the Slovak Republic was required to cover such losses for such amount. It may be born in mind that regardless whether the Slovak Republic would have to cover the full amount as claimed by CSOB, the privatisation of CSOB, that has yielded more than 17 billion SKK to the Slovak Republic, has been a profitable operation for the Slovak Republic.\n\nC. The Agreements Relating to the Second Phase\n----------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Consolidation Agreement that was the basic agreement to implement the second stage of CSOB's restructuring provided, *inter alia,* for the assignment by CSOB of nonperforming loan portfolio receivables to two so-called \"Collection Companies\", one to be established by the Czech Republic (Ceska inkasni s.r.o., hereinafter \"CI\"), and the other by the Slovak Republic (the Slovensk\u00e1 inkasn\u00e1 spol s.r.o., hereinafter \"SI\"), in their respective national territories. This operation led to the conclusion of a number of agreements which, in respect of SI, have been described collectively as the \"CSOB/SI Agreements\".\n\n28.\n\nThe \"Agreement on the Assignment of Certain Receivables of a Loan Portfolio\" (hereinafter the \"Assignment Agreement\"), and the \"Agreement to Conclude Future Agreements on the Assignments of Certain Receivables under Off-Balance Sheet Instruments\" (hereinafter the \"Future Assignment Agreement\" or \"FAA\"), that became effective on December 31, 1993, organized the assignments. On the one hand, the Assignment Agreement assigned actual balances of loans and payments made under guarantees. Two amendments to this Agreement were concluded subsequently, with the effect of changing the amount of receivables assigned. On the other hand, the FAA covered receivables that were to be created by a future payment by CSOB, *e.g.* when a letter of credit was drawn. These receivables were therefore assigned at a later stage, through several specific agreements (hereinafter the \"OBS Assignment Agreements\"). The FAA identified the amounts of receivables as specified and determined that they were related to: Technopol a.s., Slovart a.s., Chirana Export-Import, Drevo\u00fania a.s., Istroconti a.s., Martimex a.s., Elteco Zdruzenie.\n\n29.\n\nOther agreements had to organize the financing of the assignments. The Czech and Slovak Collection Companies were to receive the necessary funds from CSOB by way of a loan in order to allow them to finance the assigned receivables and to pay their nominal value (o CSOB.\n\n30.\n\nSI and CSOB thus concluded a \"Loan Agreement on the Refinancing of Assigned Receivables\" (hereinafter the \"LA\"), also effective as of December 31, 1993. The LA was amended ten times in relation to the financing of the assignment of receivables arising from the on-balance sheet instruments, some of these amendments being more relevant to this dispute than others, as will be seen below.\n\n31.\n\nThe actual assignment of the off-balance sheet instruments was carried out by the OBS Assignment Agreements, each of which relates to one particular Foreign Trade Organization (hereinafter \"FTO\"). In parallel, OBS Loan Agreements were concluded between CSOB and SI, again in respect of each FTO, providing for loan disbursements in accordance with the payments to be made for the receivables. The LA provided in Article 1(b) for the conclusion of these agreements; on the other hand, the OBS Loan Agreements stated that they were related to the LA and that both documents should only be interpreted in their mutual interconnection (Art. V). When the underlying guarantees had to be paid and CSOB\u2019s exposure materialised, SI had to pay for the transferred receivable. A corresponding Amendment to the respective OBS Loan Agreement was then concluded pursuant to which CSOB loaned SI an amount equal to the consideration part for the transferred asset.\n\n32.\n\nUncertain receivables were thus removed from CSOB\u2019s balance sheet and were replaced by payments made by the Czech and Slovak Collection Companies, financed with funds provided as a loan by CSOB.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, CSOB and SI also concluded an \"Agreement on securing activities of Slovensk\u00e1 inkasn\u00e1\" (hereinafter the \"Operation Agreement\"). Under this agreement CSOB had to take care of the administration of SI and secure the collection of the receivables CSOB had transferred to SI. For this purpose, CSOB had to put at the disposal of SI the necessary number of employees, one of which would act as executive of SI (Art. III[2]). CSOB employees performing activities for SI were subject only to orders and instructions of the executives of SI in accordance with the resolution of the General Meeting and the Supervisory Board of SI; however, they were not to act against the business interest of CSOB (Art. III[ 1 ] [2]). The activities of SI\u2019s executives were to be subject, *inter alia,* to the control and other authority of the Supervisory Board of SI (Art. III[2]). Since the MF SR was the sole shareholder of SI, it had full authority in the General Meeting and the power of appointment of the members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n34.\n\nOn the part of the Slovak Republic, the preparation and implementation of stage II of CSOB's restructuring was the responsibility of a Working Group appointed by Resolution No. 937 of the Government of the Slovak Republic of December 15, 1993. This Group was composed of selected Ministers of the Slovak Republic and the Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia.5 The Group authorized the Slovak Republic's Minister of Finance to found SI; to enter into a \"master agreement\" with the MF CR and CSOB (which later became the CA); and to prepare and enter into the required partial agreements for the purpose of securing the implementation of stage II of CSOB's transformation.6 The Working Group also charged the Minister of Finance with making provisions for the expenditures needed for the coverage of the losses of the Collection Company in the State budget for the years 1995 to 2003. SI had to be \"administered by the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\", according to the draft resolution relating to the proposai for the project for stage II7 that was \"recognized\" by the Government of the Slovak Republic and \"approved\" by the Working Group, as well as according to the report attached to this draft. The CA states in its Preamble that it was \"based on\" Resolution No. 937 of the Government of the Slovak Republic of December 15, 1993, as well as on the corresponding Resolution No. 689 of the Government of the Czech Republic of December 1, 1993.\n\nCSOB's Memorial, Exh. 6.\n\nConclusion with respect to the Proposal for the project for Stage II of the restructuring of CSOB, December 16, 1993, CSOB's Memorial, Exh. 7.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 1.\n\nD. The Cover Losses Provision of Article 3 of the CA at the Core of this Dispute\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nOne of the essential features of the assignments and their financing was that the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic had agreed in the CA that they would \"cover any losses\" of the Collection Companies. Article 3, II, 5th paragraph of the CA stated -\n\nThe losses of the Collection Company shall be compensated for over the period 1995-2003. The MF CR [Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic] and the MF SR [Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic], each undertakes to cover any losses made by the Collection Company in its respective territory.\n\n36.\n\nThe Collection Companies that had to take over the non-performing receivables at their nominal value risked never to realize these receivables. This risk was covered by the commitment from the Czech and Slovak Republics that they would \"cover\" the losses of the Collection Companies.\n\n37.\n\nThe present dispute thus turns on the meaning, scope and effect of the \"cover losses\" commitment from the Slovak Republic. CSOB claims that the Slovak Republic did not \"cover losses\" of SI as this had been agreed. Moreover, prospects of SI repaying are nil, as the SI has been subject to bankruptcy proceedings and has stopped all activities. The Slovak Republic is of the view that the \"cover losses\" provision is unenforceable as it does not satisfy the certainty requirement of Czech law. It contends that it has no liability to CSOB under this provision.\n\nE. CSOB\u2019s Claims and the Slovak Republic's Request\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn its Memorial of November 15, 1999, CSOB claimed compensation of -\n\n*1. The sum of SKK 24,659,907.271, being equal to the principal and interest due to June 30, 2000 under the SI Loan Agreement;*\n\n*2. The sum of SKK 9,064,537.958, being the additional losses of CSOB it may claim pursuant to Section 3 79 et seq. of the Commercial Code of the Czech Republic, measured by the Slovak Government bond yield to June 30, 2000;*\n\n*3. The additional sums due when the damages under 1 and 2 above are carried forward from June 30, 2000 to the date of the award to be issued in this case;*\n\n*4. Such additional sums as may be calculated and submitted to the Tribunal prior to the closure of this proceeding representing CSOB \u2019s further damages, ineluding lost productive management time and professional fees and expenses incurred relating to*\n\n*a. all proceedings relating to SI\u2019s bankruptcy,*\n\n*b. obtaining, documenting, implementing, and maintaining Czech shareholder financial support of the Bank;*\n\n*c. this proceeding; and*\n\n*d. otherwise asserting its rights under the Consolidation Agreement;*\n\n*5. Interest at a rate (or rates) to be determined on all sums aw arded from the date of the award until the date it is paid.*\n\n39.\n\nIn its final submission of June 20, 2003, CSOB has specified its claim to be awarded as compensation the following -\n\n*1. The sum as of March 31, 2003 of SKK 40,300,940.576, consisting of:*\n\n*(a) SKK 32,443,747.036 in \u2018actual damage\u2019, being equal to the diminishment in value of CSOB's rights under the SI Loan Agreement caused by the Slovak Republic's breach of the Consolidation Agreement; and*\n\n*(b) SKK 7,857,193.540, reflecting the additional gains that CSOB would have realised had the Slovak Republic satisfied its obligation to CSOB in April 1997 and if CSOB had invested the amounts then due and owing in Slovak Government bonds;*\n\n*2. CSOB's costs including all the costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding; and*\n\n*3. Interest at a rate (or rates) determined with reference to Section 735 of the Commercial Code of the Czech Republic, as amended, on all sums awarded* *from the date of the award until the date of payment.*\n\n40.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argues on various grounds that CSOB\u2019s claims are unfounded. In its submission, the Slovak Republic requested the Tribunal to issue an award -\n\n*\u2022 dismissing all of CSOB's claims;*\n\n*\u2022 ordering CSOB to pay all the Slovak Republic's costs associated with this proceeding, including attorney's fees and expenses, and*\n\n*\u2022 grant the Slovak Republic any further relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.*\n\nF. The Scope of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn front of the complex legal structure of the second stage of CSOB's restructuring and privatisation, it may be useful to recall that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is limited to claims arising under the CA. In its Second Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal confirmed its First Decision and stated that it holds -\n\nthat its competence covers, and is confined to, issues arising out of the Consolidation Agreement (No. 32)\n\n42.\n\nThe Second Decision further explained -\n\n33. - For the guidance of the parties in the merits phase of these proceedings, the Tribunal reiterates that it has jurisdiction to determine the validity, nature and scope of Respondent's obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses as provided by Article 3(II) of the Consolidation Agreement, to establish whether Respondent has breached that obligation, and to assess damages, if any, payable by Respondent to CSOB for any such breach.\n\nG. The Petition for the Declaration of SI\u2019s Bankruptcy\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn May 6, 1998, SI was declared bankrupt by the Regional Court in Bratislava. CSOB submitted an Application for registration of receivables in bankruptcy proceedings on June 23, 1998.8 CSOB also requested that the bankruptcy proceeding be dismissed on the ground that SI had only one creditor. The Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic affirmed the decision of the Bratislava Regional Court by its ruling dated September 13, 1999.\n\nStatement I. Cestr, Tab C, filed with CSOB's Request for Provisional Measures of September 4, 1998; the Slovak Republic's Observations on CSOB's Request for Provisional Measures of January 19, 2000, Exh. B; the Slovak Republic's Hearing Exhibits, November 2002, Tab 9.\n\n44.\n\nBy its Procedural Order No. 5 of March 1, 2000, the Tribunal, upon CSOB's request, recommended that the bankruptcy proceedings be suspended to the extent that such proceedings might include determinations as to whether SI has made a loss resulting from the operating costs and the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned to it by CSOB, including payment of interest, as contemplated in the Consolidation Agreement at issue in this arbitration. It also invited the Parties to keep the Tribunal informed of the implementation of this Order.\n\n45.\n\nUltimately, the Regional Court in Bratislava cancelled the bankruptcy by its decision of June 7, 2001. The Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic upheld this decision on September 19, 2001 and the cancellation of bankruptcy became effective on November 16, 2001.\n\n46.\n\nOn October 23, 2002, SI filed a second bankruptcy petition and sought to have its assets declared bankrupt. However, by decision of January 20, 2003, the Regional Court in Bratislava discontinued the proceedings as SI had not submitted the necessary evidence to sustain its request for bankruptcy. This decision of the Regional Court was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic on March 12, 2003.\n\n**III.** The Law Applicable to the **CA**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe present dispute concerns the rights and obligations in respect of CSOB and the Slovak Republic arising under the CA that was concluded to implement phase II of CSOB's restructuring and privatisation. This phase was a product of phase I and a condition precedent to phase III. Both phases I and III are essential to understand the economic purpose of phase II and the CA under which it was implemented. However, as a legal instrument, the CA stands on its own.\n\nA. The CA is a Legal Agreement\n------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has argued that the CA was not a legal agreement but a mere political resolution, expressing the political intention of the Czech and the Slovak Republics to proceed with phase II of CSOB\u2019s restructuring. It has also argued that the CA was a mere \"framework agreement\" that does not contain legally binding and enforceable obligations.\n\n49.\n\nThe nature of the CA as a legal agreement is no longer in dispute. In its First Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal has indeed recognized that the CA contains legally binding obligations at least in its parts relevant for this dispute -\n\nWhile it is true that investment disputes to which a State is a party frequently have political elements or involve governmental actions, such disputes do not lose their legal character as long as they concern legal rights or obligations or the consequences of their breach. Given these considerations, the Tribunal is satisfied that CSOB\u2019s claim is legal in character.9\n\nFirst Decision on Jurisdiction, No 61.\n\n50.\n\nBy deciding that CSOB\u2019s claim - based upon the Consolidation Agreement - is legal in character, the Tribunal thus has confirmed that the CA, at least in its relevant parts which include its Article 3, contains legally binding provisions. In view of the Parties\u2019 further arguments developed in this respect, the Tribunal adds the following observations.\n\n51.\n\nThe CA undoubtedly was entered into for a public purpose, *i.e.* to privatise CSOB pursuant to Government resolutions and to the benefit of the public finances of both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic. As the Tribunal has stated in its First Decision, the fact that the Czech and the Slovak Republics acted for a public purpose does not exclude that the CA contains rights and obligations of a legal nature.\n\n52.\n\nBy naming the document they signed a \"Consolidation Agreement\" and by submitting it to Czech law (Art. 7), the Parties themselves indicated that they considered it to be an \"agreement\" governed by law, and not a mere political resolution. Moreover, the reference contained in Article 7 CA to the Treaty on the Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic dated November 23, 1992 (hereinafter the \"BIT\"), which, as the Tribunal has stated in its First Decision (No. 55, 59, 67, 89), had the effect of submitting disputes arising under the CA to settlement by ICSID arbitration, likewise confirms that the Parties understood the CA as containing legal rules and making it legally binding. Indeed, as indicated in Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, ICSID arbitrators have to apply rules of law to the dispute, unless the parties agreed that the Tribunal decide their dispute *ex aequo et bono.* No such an agreement was concluded in the instant case.\n\n53.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has accepted on various occasions that the CA was intended to be a legal instrument and not a mere political promise. On the bottom of the LA, the Slovak Republic's Minister of Finance declared that he \"in particular, confirms the obligation under Section 7 of this Agreement\", *i.e.* a provision which in turn states that under the CA, \"the repayment of the loan including interest thereon is secured by an obligation of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic\". Although this provision cannot, in itself, determine the legal nature of the relevant rule of the CA, it demonstrates that the Slovak Republic knew and accepted the fact that it was bound by an obligation arising under the CA, relating to the repayment of the loan. This declaration was addressed to SI and CSOB as signatories of the LA. Together with SI and CSOB, the Ministry of Finance received one of the originals of the Agreement (Art. 13 LA). Further, the Slovak Republic's Minister Kozlik has stated in his letter of May 17, 1996 that the obligations of the CA were not \"legally ambiguous\".10 Moreover, several statements made on behalf of the Slovak Republic have admitted that the Slovak Republic had an obligation to pay CSOB.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek Exh. 18.\n\n54.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argued that - as a matter of principle - the CA could not be a binding agreement of a legal nature because it was a \"framework\" agreement that established nothing more than the basic principles and essential features of CSOB's consolidation during phase II. The CA had indeed been envisaged by the Czech Republic11 and the Slovak Republic12 as an agreement limited to the basic commitments in respect of CSOB's consolidation and privatisation. As Article 7(1) of the CA confirms, many specifications relevant for the actual relationships and procedures to be followed had to be agreed upon in later agreements. The CA did not and was not designed to spell out all the necessary details of the transaction. Indeed, it often instructed the Parties to make further arrangements, in particular as to the establishment of Collection Companies,13 the further assignment of off-balance receivables,14 the grant of loans,15 the mechanism to cover losses,16 the further relations between the shareholders17 and any other more detailed regulation of the various parties\u2019 relationships or on appropriate technical procedures.18\n\nResolution No. 689 of the Government of the Czech Republic of December 1, 1993.\n\nConclusions of December 16, 1993 of the Working Group created by the Government of the Slovak Republic.\n\nArt. 3(II)(1)\n\nArt. 3 (II) (2 and 3)\n\nArt. 3 (II) (4)\n\nArt. 3 (II) (5)\n\nArt. 7(1)\n\nArt. 7(1)\n\n55.\n\nHowever, the assertion that an agreement is not a legally binding agreement when it leaves open some matters to be specified later cannot be sustained. The fact that an agreement imposes obligations to do something at a future time does not mean, in itself, that such an obligation is not legally binding, even when such obligation only specifies the target to reach and leaves the contracting Parties or one of them free to determine the means and mechanism to do so.\n\n56.\n\nThe obligations of the Consolidation Agreement that required further specification *(e.g.* Article 3 - Improvement in CSOB\u2019s balance; Article 4 - Privatisation of CSOB; Article 5 - Development of CSOB in the Slovak Republic; Article 6 - Institutional Form of CSOB's Activity in the Slovak Republic) imposed sufficiently specific obligations upon the parties in the nature of legally binding agreements, and they also specified how they had to be implemented.\n\n57.\n\nThe comparison made by the Slovak Republic, following one of its legal experts,19 with the \"Agreement on Economic Cooperation\" between Czechoslovakia and Yemen of March 24, 197820 and the \"Arrangement\" concluded between CSOB and the Bank of Yemen \"on behalf of their respective governments\" on May 7, 1979,21 does not allow another conclusion in respect of the legal nature of the CA. The fact that this Cooperation Agreement is called a \"framework agreement\" by the Slovak Republic does not mean that it is similar in nature to the CA, even if the term \"framework agreement\" is also used in respect of the CA. This Arrangement is a mere instrument for the implementation and completion of the Economic Agreement between Czechoslovakia and Yemen,22 whereby two banks, on behalf of their respective Governments, established accounting and financial procedures as provided for in the bilateral Cooperation Agreement. The CA, on the contrary, although created to carry out the resolutions of each of the two States, is the basic agreement concluded between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, as well as CSOB. It was concluded by CSOB in its own capacity and contains primary obligations that do not just complement another agreement. Therefore, CSOB\u2019s position as a party to the CA is different from its position as a party to the Arrangement mentioned above. The Slovak Republic\u2019s legal expert accepts that the CA was signed as a tripartite agreement, with CSOB as a direct party thereto, and that the CA, therefore, differs from the bilateral agreement signed between Czechoslovakia and Yemen that he characterizes as a \"framework agreement\".23 This demonstrates that the \"model\" consisting of the agreements relating to the cooperation with Yemen does not apply to the CA which has a different nature and content. Therefore, if the term \"framework agreement\" is used in respect of the CA and one or both of the above mentioned agreements, it does not have the same meaning.\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, No. 28/29.\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, Exh. 10.\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, Exh. 11.\n\nThe provisions of the Arrangement referred to the corresponding provisions of the Economic Agreement (except Article 3 of the Arrangement that specified Article 1 of the same Arrangement).\n\nCf.

The expert\u2019s conclusion is anyhow rather vague when he states that the alleged fact that the CA was a \"framework agreement\" is \"obviously a more probable interpretation\" than the construction that the cover losses obligation is a \"comfort letter\". Even if such a conclusion would be correct, it does not demonstrate that the CA was a framework agreement of the type described by the expert.\n\nB. The Role of International Law in Respect of the CA\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe question has been raised whether and if so, to which extent, the CA was governed by public international law.\n\n59.\n\nThe CA, as a whole, is not a Treaty between States, governed by international law. The fact that two States, *i.e.* the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, concluded an agreement is not sufficient to make such agreement subject to international law, especially as a commercial entity - *i.e.* CSOB - was also party thereto.\n\n60.\n\nThe Slovak Republic's experts on Czech law envisaged the possibility that the CA was \"an agreement of a mixed nature, containing both public international law duties between the two States, and private law obligations of the individual Parties\".24 In their view, the state-to-state obligations and rights contained in the CA - *i.e.* those between both Republics - would be governed by international law. Thus the engagement of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic to cause their respective shareholders to increase CSOB\u2019s capital (Art. 2 CA) would be subject to international law. However, even in the hypothesis that international law were to apply to the relationship between the two Republics, the Slovak Republic's experts concede that the rights and obligations of individual Parties, *i.e.* CSOB, were governed by national law.\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professors Pohunek, Stuna and Svestka, No. 11-12, 33.\n\n61.\n\nThe concept of \"State Contracts\" has also been used by one of the Slovak Republic's experts to characterise the CA.25 In this respect, the reference to the BIT as included in Article 7(4) CA has been seen as a \"manifestation of increased protection of a private legal entity signing a contract with two sovereign states\".26 However, this expert has also admitted that the space left for the application of international law was significantly narrow, in light of the reference to Czech law contained in the choice of law clause of Article 7(4),27 which reads as follows -\n\nThis agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and the Treaty on the Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic dated November 23, 1992.\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, No. 38; TR, November 9.2002, 67:2-68:23 (Sturma).\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, No. 39; TR, November 9.2002, 68:16-71:8 (Sturma).\n\nTR, November 9, 2002, 69:5-18 (Sturma); Rejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, No. 50.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal need not engage in a broad discussion about the relevance of international law in respect of the CA and of the possible characterization of the latter as a \"State Contract\" concluded between two States and a private law entity. The law applicable to the provision relevant to this dispute, *i.e.* Article 3 CA, is determined by Article 7(4) as being Czech Law and the BIT. Any further focus has to be on these two sets of rules. CSOB has stated that international law could also be applicable as a matter of Czech law. Such an application of international law through Czech law is, however, not relevant for the resolution of this dispute.\n\n63.\n\nPursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"The Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties\". An implied submission to international law can be seen in Article 7(4) CA where it is stated that the CA shall be governed by the BIT, in addition to the laws of the Czech Republic. In its First Decision on Jurisdiction (No. 55), the Tribunal concluded that by referring to the BIT in Article 7(4) CA, the Parties intended to incorporate the arbitration clause of Article 8 of the BIT into the CA. As the reference to the BIT in Article 7(4) is not limited to this particular provision, such incorporation into the CA is equally pertinent in respect of any other provision of the BIT that may be relevant for the interpretation and application of the CA. Even to the extent the CA is not governed by international law as such, the BIT, as it is incorporated into the CA, has to be interpreted in the context of the legal system under which it has been drafted. Consequently, the incorporation of the BIT includes the rules of international law that are relevant for its interpretation. Article 2(2) BIT states -\n\nInvestments of investors of each Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other Party.\n\nC. Is the CA Governed by Czech Public Law ?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe CA expressly states in Article 7(4) that it \"shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic\". The Slovak Republic has argued that this reference, in light of the two States being parties, had to be understood as a choice of Czech public law.\n\n65.\n\nThe fact that the conclusion of the CA involved two States and that it was a consequence of several public law instruments, such as constitutional provisions, government resolutions, regulatory decisions and government authorizations, does not make the CA itself an agreement governed by Czech public law. Such acts of public law by the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic do not make the CA, which is a different legal instrument that stands on its own, an agreement governed by the public law of the Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic. It is equally irrelevant whether other banks in the Czech and the Slovak Republics were later restructured and privatised on the basis of instruments governed by public law *(i.e.* by governmental resolutions) and not by private law agreements. In those later instances, one State only was acting as shareholder and ordered the privatisation. In the case of CSOB, to the contrary, the consolidation could not be ordered on the basis of a resolution of one State; it had to be managed by the two State-shareholders on the basis of an agreement involving both States and CSOB.\n\n66.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also argued that the CA was a public law instrument as it raises rights and obligations between the two Republics only, whereas CSOB did not have any rights arising from the imposed obligations, in particular under the provisions of Article 3 CA. This argument appears to be linked to the proposition that the CA constitutes a framework agreement of a type that is allegedly often used in state-to-state relations, and which does not confer direct actionable rights on private parties, *e.g.* CSOB.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the term \"framework agreement\" has been used in these proceedings with different meanings (as this has been illustrated hereinbefore in respect of the comparison between the CA and the Economic Cooperation Agreement concluded between Czechoslovakia and Yemen). One of these meanings at least corresponds to a type of agreement that contains particular rights and obligations notwithstanding the fact that they need further implementation through negotiation and more specific agreements. The Tribunal has stated that the CA is a legal agreement and that it contains rights and obligations of a legally binding nature. When the Slovak Republic contends that the CA, by its nature as a framework agreement, is a public law instrument not conferring any right on CSOB, the Slovak Republic draws a general and conceptual conclusion that is not supported by a detailed analysis of the particular provisions of the CA that are relevant for this dispute.\n\n68.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the pertinent approach must be different. CSOB's claim is of a legal nature and based on the cover losses provision of Article 3 CA. The fundamental issue in these proceedings is whether CSOB can derive any right to claim under this provision against the Slovak Republic. This matter has to be examined on the basis of the rules of Czech law that are capable of creating rights in favor of private parties such as CSOB, *i.e.* Czech private law, provided all legal requirements are met. In fact, the Slovak Republic adopted, this approach when advocating the opinion that the cover losses provision of Article 3 CA was not valid to the extent it was based on the relevant provisions of the Czech Civil and Commercial Codes. Indeed, as Czech public law, as alleged by the Slovak Republic, does not create substantive rights for private parties like CSOB,28 Czech private law is the only source of law that could support the existence of such rights.\n\nIt may be noted that the argument that legal instruments governed by Czech public law do not create any right on private parties has been put forward by the Slovak Republic's legal experts without being further supported. The underlying documentation confirms that under public law, the State and the individual party do not enjoy equal status or position. This, however, seems not to allow the conclusion that the private party would have \"no right\" in such a public law relation.\n\n69.\n\nA State's public law regulates the State's organization and its relation with the population living in the same territory. It is not intended to govern the relations to other States. One of the Slovak Republic's legal experts pointed out that the fact that Czech public law assumes unequal positions between the parties renders its application in relation to the Slovak Republic impossible. This was because the Czech Republic could not have a higher legal position than the Slovak Republic which had to be legally in an equal position. He concluded that Czech public law was therefore not applicable to the CA.29\n\nRejoinder Opinion of Professor Sturma, No. 44; TR, November 9, 2002, 31:1-8 (Sturma).\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the view that Czech public law is not applicable to the provisions of Article 3 CA that are relevant to the resolution of this dispute. It does not and does not have to make a statement on the question of whether the CA may contain some other provisions that may call for the application of Czech public law and that would thus allow the CA to be characterized as a \"mixed agreement\".\n\nD. Czech Private Law Is Applicable to Article 3 CA\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nAs it is stated aboye, the reference in Article 7(4) CA to Czech law cannot be found to have the meaning that Czech public law would govern CSOB's claim under Article 3 CA, with the effect that CSOB would be deprived of any right arising under this provision. This dispute is therefore governed by Czech private law. The Tribunal adds that this conclusion is the only way to give effect to the Parties\u2019 choice to have the BIT applicable by incorporation into the CA. Indeed, Article 2(2) BIT which ensures CSOB \"full protection and security\" for its investment in the territory of the Slovak Republic would be without any useful effect if CSOB were to have no right in respect of the CA under Czech public law, as this has been argued by the Slovak Republic.\n\n72.\n\nIt may further be added that the Slovak Republic's legal experts on Czech law, despite the fact that they contend that CSOB has no rights as a private party under Article 3 CA,30 nevertheless accept that the CA has a private law part and that the provisions of Article 3 CA, to the extent they may create rights of CSOB, are to be interpreted on the basis of Czech private law.31 They add in this respect the following -\n\nAfter all, all the parties considered the Consolidation Agreement as a commercial law agreement and confirmed this fact also in the course of these arbitration proceedings, doing that they in fact made a subsequent choice of law under Section 262 of the Commercial Code.32\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to examine whether the Parties have concluded effectively a subsequent choice of Czech private law in the course of these proceedings. Indeed, such a choice was already made when they accepted the choice of law clause in Article 7(4) CA. This was also the conclusion of another expert, presented by the Slovak Republic during the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings, who stated that -\n\n... the nature of the Consolidation Agreement is a private law agreement, i.e. a civil law or commercial law agreement.33\n\n... the Consolidation Agreement is a special agreement that, in terms of its strict legal nature, falls into the category of private law agreements.34\n\nOpinion by Professors Pohunek, Stuna and Svestka, No. 41-50.\n\nOpinion by Professors Pohunek, Stuna and Svestka, No. 51-56; Rejoinder Opinion, No. 11.34.\n\nOpinion by Professors Pohunek, Stuna and Svestka, No. 56.\n\nAffidavit of A.

Introduction\n---------------\n\n73.\n\nThis dispute turns on the meaning of Article 3 of the CA that aimed at the \"Improvement of CSOB\u2019s Balance\". It relates in particular to part II of the second section of the same Article, under the heading \"Establishment of Collection Companies and Transfer of CSOB's Non-Performing Assets to the Collection Companies\". There is no controversy about the fact that these Collection Companies have been established as agreed and that SI was the Company operating for the purposes determined in Article 3(II) in the Slovak Republic. In the second (not numbered) paragraph of the same provision, it was agreed that CSOB\u2019s non-performing receivables were to be transferred to the Czech and the Slovak Collection Companies in a ratio of about 3:1, each Company being assigned receivables from entities domiciled in the respective Republic. The amount of such receivables had to be specified as of December 31.1993, \"so that the actual capital adequacy of CSOB as of the same date amounts to 6.25%\". On the basis of this provision, CSOB and each Collection Company had to specify in a subsequent agreement which receivables had actually to be transferred.\n\n74.\n\nIn order to improve CSOB\u2019s balance, the third paragraph of Article 3(II) CA stipulated that the Collection Companies had to pay to CSOB as a \"consideration\" the nominal value of the assigned receivables, together with the interest accrued thereupon until the time of the assignment. In respect of this payment, it was further provided as follows -\n\nThe payment for the assigned receivables shall be made by the Collection Companies on the basis of a schedule of payments for the assigned receivables over the years 1995 to 2003. CSOB shall provide a loan to cover the 1994 operating costs of the Collection Companies and secure the refinancing of the Collection Companies by making advances under a loan facility up to the sum of considerations for the receivables assigned to the Collection Companies. The terms and conditions for the refinancing shall be determined under special agreements to be entered into by and among CSOB and the Czech and Slovak Collection Companies.\n\n75.\n\nAs the receivables to be assigned were defined as non-performing and in fact were recoverable for small amounts only, the Collection Companies could never be placed in a position to recover the full nominal value of the assigned receivables which would have allowed the repayment of the loan to CSOB. The Parties to the CA undertook in paragraph 4 of Article 3(II)35 to identify this consequence in the following terms -\n\nIt follows from the nature of the assigned receivables that the Collection Companies will make a loss. Such loss will result from the operating costs and the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned by CSOB to the Collection Companies, including payments of interests.\n\nThis provision will be referred to as Article 3(II)(4) CA. The same applies, *mutatis mutandis,* to the other paragraphs of Article 3(II) CA.\n\n76.\n\nFurthermore, Article 3(II) stated in its paragraph 5 the so-called \"cover losses provision\" -\n\nThe losses of the Collection Companies shall be compensated for over the period 1995-2003. The MF CR and the MF SR each undertakes to cover any losses made by the Collection Company in its respective territory. For this purpose, the MF CR, in co-operation of the NPF CR [National Property Fund of the Czech Republic], shall prepare a mechanism for covering any losses of the Czech Collection Company and the MF SR shall prepare a mechanism for covering any losses of the Slovak Collection Company.\n\n77.\n\nCSOB has submitted its claim based on an alleged undertaking by the Slovak Republic in the provision just quoted to cover any losses made by the Slovak Collection Company. The Slovak Republic, from its side, contends that this cover losses provision does not have such meaning and legal effect. For the Slovak Republic, this provision lacks any required precision, is too vague, not sufficiently specific, not intelligible and it does not identify adequately and in a legally binding way what CSOB holds to be the object of the Slovak Republic's obligation.\n\n78.\n\nThe Parties thus have different views as to the meaning and effects of the cover losses provision. This controversy can be centered on two issues. One issue relates to how the cover losses provision has to be understood and interpreted. The other issue, which is linked to the first issue, relates to the question of whether the content of the cover losses provision was certain enough to be legally binding.\n\n79.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, the CA - or at least the cover losses provision - is thus null and void because its meaning is uncertain. The Slovak Republic relies in this respect on Section 37(1) of the Czech Civil Code that states -\n\nAn act in law must be made... in a definite and intelligible [also expressed as \"understandable\"] manner; otherwise the act is invalid.\n\n80.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also refers to Section 269(2) of the Czech Commercial Code that states specifically for innominate contracts that -\n\nIf the Parties fail to identify adequately the object of their obligations, such a contract is not considered as concluded.\n\n81.\n\nOn the basis of these provisions of Czech law, the Slovak Republic objects that the cover losses provision - or the whole CA - does not satisfy Section 37(1) of the Civil Code and Section 269(2) of the Commercial Code, and is therefore null and void. The Slovak Republic argues forcefully that no interpretation can revive an imprecise and therefore invalid contractual provision as the cover losses provision of the CA.\n\nB. The Rules of Czech Law Applicable to the Interpretation of Article 3 CA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. In general*\n---------------\n\n82.\n\nThe requirement that a contract provision is \"definite and intelligible\" (Section 37 Civil Code) and that it should adequately identify the obligations undertaken (Section 269 Commercial Code), does not require that the text of the provision is so detailed and precise that it would be entirely sufficient to simply read the provision in order to understand its Content. If that were the case, the rules of Czech law on the interpretation of contracts, laid down in Sections 35 Civil Code and 266 Commercial Code and discussed hereafter, would be meaningless.\n\n83.\n\nSection 37 Civil Code and Section 269 Commercial Code have to be read in the light of, respectively, Section 35 Civil Code and Section 266 Commercial Code. These provisions give room, in particular, to the Parties\u2019 own intentions and understanding. Section 37 Civil Code and Section 269 Commercial Code only require that the Parties\u2019 agreement is sufficiently definite and clear to define the Parties\u2019 mutual obligations. The interpretation tools indicated in Section 35 Civil Code and Section 266 Commercial Code may serve to understand that the agreement meets the requirements in respect of the precisi\u00f3n of its content under Section 37 Civil Code and Section 269 Commercial Code.\n\n84.\n\nBoth Parties accept that to the extent that the CA may create rights for which CSOB has title to sue, the Czech Commercial Code applies to the CA. To construe the meaning of the relevant provisions of the CA, Section 266(3) of the Czech Commercial Code instructs the Tribunal as follows -\n\nWhen interpreting a manifestation of will under subsections (1) and (2), due account shall be taken of all the circumstances related to the manifestation of will, including the negotiations about conclusion of the contract in question and the practice which the parties have introduced between themselves, as well as the subsequent conduct of the parties, if the nature of the case so permits.\n\nThus, all the relevant circumstances, including the context and purpose of the agreement, the history of the negotiation and the Parties\u2019 subsequent conduct, are relevant to reconstruct the Parties\u2019 intentions and to identify the meaning of their agreement.\n\n*2. The relevance of the wording*\n---------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Slovak Republic, through the first Opinion of its legal experts on Czech law, submitted that the CA was a commercial agreement, governed by the Commercial Code.36 Only at a later stage37 did it argue that equally relevant for the construction of the CA was Civil Code Section 35. The Slovak Republic then argued that indeed both Section 35 Civil Code and Section 266 Commercial Code applied to commercial contracts.\n\nOpinion Pohunek, Stuna & Svetska, No. 56 and 187.\n\nRejoinder, Pohunek, Stuna & Svetska, No. 60.\n\n86.\n\nSection 35(2) Civil Code states in respect of the interpretation of an expression of a will in words the following -\n\nActs in law expressed in words shall be construed not only according to the verbal expressions but shall also in particular take into account the intention [also translated as \"will\"] of the person who performed the act, provided that such intention is not conflicting [also translated as \"inconsistent\"] with the wording.\n\n87.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argues that Section 35 Civil Code differs from Section 266 Commercial Code in respect of the last part of the provision where it is emphasized that the intention of the parties shall not be upheld if it would be contrary to the wording of the agreement. It contends that under Section 35 Civil Code, the Tribunal cannot take into account the alleged intention of the Parties to give a meaning to the cover losses provision when this alleged intention is contradicted by the wording of their agreement. In this respect, Section 35 Civil Code does, in the Slovak Republic's view, prevail over Section 266 Commercial Code.\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the relationship between Section 35 Civil Code and Section 266 Commercial Code is a delicate and debated matter under Czech law. The starting point is that commercial agreements are governed by the Commercial Code as the Czech Commercial Code Section 1(2) clearly indicates. This first Section of the Czech Commercial Code reads, under the title \"Scope of the Code\", as follows -\n\n(1) This Code regulates the status of entrepreneurs, business obligations and some other relationships connected with business activities.\n\n(2) The legal relationships specified in subsection (1) above are subject to the provisions of this Code. Should it prove impossible to resolve certain issues according to the provisions of this Code, they shall be resolved in accordance with the civil law provisions. In the event that such issues cannot be resolved in accordance with the civil law provisions, they shall be considered according to trade usage (commercial practice) and, in the absence of this, according to the principies upon which this Code is based.\n\nPursuant to this provision, the CA, that the Parties agree to be subject of the Czech Commercial Code, is governed by this Code. This includes Section 266 of the same Code on the matter of interpretation of the Parties\u2019 will, and in particular paragraph 3 of this Section. The Slovak Republic has not argued that Section 266 would not allow the resolution of issues of interpretation in respect of the CA. This would be the only case where the Civil Code could come into play according to Section 1(2) Commercial Code.38 The Slovak Republic argues that Section 35 Civil Code shall apply as it is more restrictive in matters of interpretation than Section 266 Commercial Code. This, however, is not a situation for which Section 1(2) Commercial Code provides for the application of the Civil Code to commercial agreements.\n\nProfessors Pohunek, Stuna and Svetska, who support in their Rejoinder Opinion the application of Section 35 Civil Code (No. 60), confirm that the general rules of the Civil Code are applicable only if there are no special rules in the Commercial Code and, in other words, that the Civil Code can be applied only if the rules of the Commercial Code are incomplete (No. 56); see TR, November 11, 2002, 77:5-21 (Pohunek). See further the Reply Affidavit of A. Banyaiov\u00e1, of July 17, 1998, No. 31, that recalls the same interpretation, accepting, however, that both provisions (See. 35 Civil Code and See. 266 Commercial Code) apply jointly (No. 35) and that a manifestation of will is interpreted according to the intention of the parties, but not inconsistently with the wording used by the acting party. The intention of the acting party is taken into account to the extent it was known to the other party (No. 36). The same view has been expressed by Professor K. Eli\u00e1s, *A Course of Commercial Law,* 2nd edition 1999, page 42, Annex 22 of the Rejoinder Opinion of Professors Pohunek, Stuna and Svetska.\n\n89.\n\nThree recent decisions of the Czech Supreme Court do not support the view that Section 35 Civil Code may prevail over Section 266 Commercial Code. They rather indicate that the latter provision prevails, or that both Sections may be combined and lead to the same result of the interpretation. In its decision of November 15, 2000,39 the Czech Supreme Court decided that in a case where it was not clear between the parties whether a contractual penalty or default interest was agreed upon by the word \"penalty\" used in their agreement, \"it was appropriate to consider the arrangement in question under the provision of Section 35(2) of the Civil Code and Section 266(1) and (3) of the Commercial Code\". The decision did quote, but did not further examine, these provisions, the judgment of the appellate court being reversed and the case remanded for further trial. The decision also indicates that the appellate court, in regard to the sanctions agreed by the parties upon the occurrence of a default in payment, referred to both the Civil Code (Sections 544-588) and the Commercial Code (Sections 297-323), and concluded that the agreement was not contrary to any mandatory legal rule. In a decision of February 7, 2001, the Supreme Court criticized the appellate court that came to the conclusion that in the particular case, the legal act was uncertain pursuant to Section 37 Civil Code \"without interpreting this act pursuant to Section 266 of the Commercial Code\".40 In a more recent decision, dated November 5, 2002,41 the Czech Supreme Court had to deal with an applicant who claimed commission payments based on a brokerage contract and who reproached the appellate court \"for failing to proceed in accordance with Section 35(2) of the Civil Code by interpreting the wording of the said brokerage contract\". The Supreme Court referred the matter back to the appellate court, stating that the appellate court's \"fundamental error\" was \"that it completely failed to apply Section 266 of the Commercial Code to the case at hand, which Section 266 sets out rules governing the interpretation of manifestations of will in business relations\". No mention of Section 35 Civil Code was made in this finding of the Czech Supreme Court.\n\nNo. 29 Cdo 2735/99.\n\nNo. 29 Cdo 1402/99.\n\nNo. 29 Odo 512/2002.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that on the basis of Section 1(2) Commercial Code and in light of these decisions, the argument cannot be retained that Section 35 Civil Code prevails over Section 266 Commercial Code in matters governed by the latter Code. It cannot be retained that Section 35 Civil Code, to the extent it is considered more restrictive than Section 266 Commercial Code with regard to elements of interpretation that might differ from the agreement's wording, would render inapplicable the pertinent provision of Section 266 Commercial Code to the interpretation of an agreement governed by this Code.\n\n91.\n\nThat Section 266 Commercial Code prevails over Section 35 Civil Code, however, is not alone decisive to reach a conclusion on this issue. Indeed, Section 35 of the Civil Code, that states that the Parties\u2019 intention shall not be contrary to the wording of the agreement, does not require that the Parties\u2019 intention is somehow reflected or recognizable in the terms used in the agreement. It only excludes intentions that are contrary to these terms. Section 35 thus allows retaining the intention of the Parties, even if it has not been reflected in the wording of the agreements. The only restriction to this is that the Parties\u2019 intent must not be contradicted by the wording of the agreement as such wording may be interpreted.\n\n92.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, in a case where a contract provision is too vague, it cannot become valid by later specification from the Parties. Interpretation only allows specifying the content of an existing contractual provision; it cannot turn a vague and therefore legally unbinding commitment into a valid contract by making an imprecise and therefore ineffective manifestation of will more precise. In brief, it cannot rescue a provision that was vague and therefore non-existent. However, interpretation can help to understand the meaning of a contract provision. This has been confirmed by a decision of the Czech Supreme Court of October 7, 1998,42 quoted by the Slovak Republic, where it is stated that \"by interpretation it is not possible to supplement a legal act\", while \"by interpretation it is only possible to determine the content of a legal act\". In another case the Czech Supreme Court decided on November 26, 1998 that interpretation can be used to see whether the agreement was sufficiently certain and definite to be valid.43 It ruled that -\n\n... it is precisely the process of interpretation that is to dispel doubts as to the content of the legal act, even in case that the written manifestation of will contains an expression permitting multiple interpretations.44\n\nIn the decision referred to above, of February 7, 2001, the appellate court was criticized because it considered a legal act uncertain without interpreting the act pursuant to Section 266 Commercial Code. In another example, a clause that \"the price may be altered\" was in itself not *per se* unclear, insufficient and thus uncertain; it all depended on what the parties understood under this provision. Because in that case it was clear for the parties that such clause meant that the price would be adapted to changes in the currency rate, it was sufficiently clear to be binding.45 In a more recent decision, rendered on November 5, 2002 and referred to above, the Czech Supreme Court explained that a clause that used a clear term can still be a matter for interpretation, as follows -\n\nThe fact that the parties used a statutory term (contractual fine) in the contract, with reference to the applicable provisions of the law, does not in itself rule out the application of Section 266 of the Commercial Code and cannot justify the court interpreting the legal act in question solely according to the meaning of the verbal expression ensuing from the referenc\u00e9d legal norm, without regard to the acting parties\u2019 intent, or the circumstances relevant for the interpretation of the parties\u2019 manifestation of will within the meaning of Section 266 of the Commercial Code, as the case may be.\n\nAnother decision of the Czech Supreme Court, dated October 27, 1999, stated -\n\nIf the principle that the content of a legal action may only be determined by interpretation, and that the demonstration of will cannot be amended thereby, is respected (cf.....), the will of the person/entity who undertook the action, can be determined, *inter alia,* with regard to subsequent conduct of the contractual parties (cf....).46\n\nNo. 1 Odon 1\u00cd0/97.\n\nCzech Supreme Court, November 26, 1998, No. 25 CDO 1650/98.\n\nFor a similar ruling see Czech Supreme Court, May 30, 2000, No. 32 Cdo 2061/99.\n\nCzech Supreme Court, August 31, 1999, No. 29 Cdo 2400/98-41.\n\nNo. 2 Cdon 824/97.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes therefore that the interpretation of Article 3 of the CA is to be done in light of all relevant circumstances as mentioned in Section 266(3) Commercial Code. Elements of interpretation other than the wording of the agreement may prevail over verbal expressions used in the text unless the wording in itself represents the Parties\u2019 understanding and intention in respect of the agreement. Even if Section 35(2) Civil Code would be of some relevance in this dispute, it does not impose a strictly literal understanding of the CA, nor does it support that expressions contained in Article 3 CA would be interpreted without considering the Parties\u2019 intention in concluding this provision.\n\nC. The Legal Nature of the Cover Losses Provision of Article 3 CA\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nIn the Parties\u2019 submissions and in the oral debate, various legal terms have been used to characterize the cover losses provision of Article 3 CA. CSOB mentioned that this provision is or comes close to a guarantee, a security or a comfort letter. The Slovak Republic voiced objections to such terms, either because the CA did not comply with the legal requirements related to a particular type of contract, or because Czech law does not know a particular undertaking, like \"comfort letters\". In his declaration set fourth at the end of the Loan Agreement, entered into between SI and CSOB, the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic accepted Article 7 LA that uses the term \"secure\" in this respect. Mr. Magu\u00eda, representing the MF SR, initialed the Operation Agreement that uses the term \"guarantee\" (Art. IV/3). The Slovak Republic also argued that none of the available types of contracts could be relevant, as the CA was a mere \"framework agreement\" that provided for nothing more than general principles requiring further implementation in order to be legally binding.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal does not uphold the submission that Article 3 CA were to represent a \"framework agreement\" that does not contain obligations of a legally binding nature. In the course of the proceedings, both Parties came to accept the view that Article 3 CA, respectively the CA as a whole, did not represent a particular type of contract known in Czech law as a nominate agreement. Such an agreement is regulated by law as an individual type of contract containing \"the essential elements of a contract as specified in the fundamental provisions for each of these contracts\" (Section 269(1) Commercial Code). The legal undertaking in dispute has therefore to be qualified as an innominate agreement. The expressions used by the parties are as a consequence not to be linked to a particular nominate agreement and to its specific legal requirements. The conclusion of an innominate agreement is a matter for the parties\u2019 autonomy, as stated in Section 269(2) Commercial Code that reads as follows -\n\nParties may also conclude a contract which is not specified as a particular type of contract. However, if the parties fail to identify adequately [also translated as: \"sufficiently define\"] the object of their obligations, such a contract is not considered as concluded.\n\n96.\n\nAs has been noted above, the Slovak Republic did also refer in this respect to Section 37(1) Civil Code that states that an \"act in law\" is valid only if it is made in a \"definite and intelligible\" manner. The Tribunal finds, however, that the agreement contained in Article 3 CA is based upon and has to be examined in respect of the relevant provisions of the Commercial Code. The Parties have accepted that the CA is a commercial agreement. In light of Section 1(2) Commercial Code, there is no particular reason that would allow to have Section 269(2) Commercial Code supplemented by Section 37(1) Civil Code.\n\n97.\n\nSection 269 Commercial Code also deals in paragraph 3 with cases where the content of an obligation is identified in subsequent agreements. This provision reads as follows -\n\nAn agreement regarding a certain part of a contract may be replaced by an agreement of the parties on the method allowing the content of the obligation to be defined subsequently, provided that such method does not depend on the will of one party only. If a missing part of a contract is to be established by a court or a particular person, the agreement must be in writing and the provisions of Section 291 shall apply *mutatis mutandis.*\n\nIt may be recalled that this provision follows paragraph 2 that declares an innominate agreement not concluded if it fails to identify adequately the object of the parties\u2019 respective obligations. Nothing in the text of these provisions prevents the conclusion that a further agreement on the identification of the content of an innominate agreement may also allow the adequate identification of the object of the parties\u2019 obligations in an agreement that otherwise would not meet the requirement on precision as stated in paragraph 2. Section 269(3) Commercial Code constitutes therefore a further confirmation that an agreement can contain legally binding rights and obligations even if their identification may be in part contained in subsequent agreements like those referred to in Article 7(1) CA. Therefore, the issue of whether the CA may be called a \"framework agreement\" or not is not relevant.\n\nD. The Notion of \"Losses\" that Triggers a \"Cover Losses\" Obligation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has argued that it is uncertain as to which \"losses\" Article 3 CA refers and what that term means. As this expression did not sufficiently define the Slovak Republic's alleged obligation to \"cover\" the \"losses\" of SI, no agreement was validly concluded that would create any liability of the Slovak Republic towards CSOB in respect of the repayment of the loan extended to SI.\n\n99.\n\nThe inquiry into the meaning of \"losses\" has to start from what the CA says about this notion. Article 3(II)(4) specifically indicates that the loss will be attributable to each Collection Company and that it results from the operating costs and from the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned by CSOB to the Collection Companies, including payments of interest.\n\n100.\n\nThe dominant part of such a loss is related to the payment for the receivables assigned to SI. This will be dealt with first. The payment of SI's operating costs will be dealt with thereafter.\n\n*1. The losses related to the assigned non-performing receivables*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nWhat the Parties meant by the notion \"loss\" in connection to \"schedule of payments for the assigned receivables\" follows from the economics of the assignments and the place of the references to the term \"loss\" within the text of Article 3(II) CA. Indeed, Article 3(II)(3) first states that the non-performing receivables had to be paid at their nominal value (including any interest accrued). The payment was to be made on the basis of a schedule of payments over 1995 to 2003. In order to allow the Collection Companies to make such payment effectively, CSOB undertook to make advances under a loan facility up to the sum of \"consideration\" for the receivables assigned to the Collection Companies. Immediately thereafter, Article 3(II)(4) CA continues and specifies -\n\nIt *follows* from the nature of the assigned receivables that the Collection Companies will make a *loss,* [emphasis added]\n\n102.\n\nThe term *'\u2018follows\"* clearly indicates that the Parties considered the loss to be triggered by the fact that the nominal value (including interest) of the receivables, payable by the Collection Companies to CSOB, would be higher than the amount for these receivables actually received by the Collection Companies from third parties.\n\n*a. The relevant schedule of payments*\n--------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nArticle 3(II)(4) CA further specifies that the losses will result from \"the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned by CSOB to the Collection Companies, including payments of interest\". In the preceding sub-paragraph, it is stated that the Collection Companies\u2019 payment for the assigned receivables had to be made \"on the basis of a schedule of payments for the assigned receivables over the years 1995 to 2003\".\n\n104.\n\nIt is undisputed that no \"schedule of payments for the assigned receivables\" was established in conformity with the literal reading of the agreement. In fact, the payment for the receivables has immediately been made in full as a \"consideration\" upon their respective assignment. Such assignment occurred, as foreseen in Article 3(II)(2), on December 31, 1993 for the on-balance sheet receivables (under the Assignment Agreement). For the off-balance sheet receivables, the payment for the full nominal value was to be made at their respective maturity dates for these receivables (under the OBS Assignment Agreement, Art. IV).\n\n105.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, however, the provisions of the CA, and Article 3 in particular, should be understood literally. When Article 3 refers to \"losses\" resulting from payments under a \"schedule of payments for the receivables assigned\", losses out of payment of a loan are excluded because *contra verba.*\n\n106.\n\nFor CSOB, the Parties intended and understood this reference to a \"schedule of payments for the receivables assigned\" as a reference to the loan payment schedule.\n\n107.\n\nIt is obvious - in spite of the *prima facie* meaning of the reference to a \"schedule of payments for the receivables assigned\", that the Parties did not intend that the receivables would be paid by the Collection Companies in installments from 1995 to 2003. Indeed, the purpose of the whole transfer of receivables was to improve CSOB\u2019s balance by replacing the bad assets by good ones as per the end of December 1993 in order to make CSOB\u2019s privatisation more attractive and profitable for its shareholders, *i.e.* mainly the Slovak Republic and- the Czech Republic. An outstanding claim for payment of non-performing receivables would not fit that purpose. A \"schedule of payment for the receivables assigned\" is indeed incompatible with the ultimate goal of the consolidation, *i.e.* to replace CSOB\u2019s bad receivables by performing assets equivalent to the full nominal value of the assigned receivables. The transaction thus required that the nonprofitable receivables had to be paid in full as of December 31, 1993 - and not in installments covering many years.\n\n108.\n\nWhen the receivables were actually assigned by CSOB to SI, the loans under which SI obtained the funds to pay for the receivables were accepted by CSOB and SI to be closely interconnected with the assignments. Indeed, the loan for the assignment of the on-balance receivables was recognized by CSOB and SI to be a \"follow-up\" agreement to the Assignment Agreement, both agreements having to be read \"in their mutual conjunction\" (Art. 13 LA); the declaration of the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic includes this statement in his consent. The OBS Loan Agreements as well mention that they are related to the respective OBS Assignment Agreement and that both agreements \"shall only be interpreted in their mutual interconnection\" (Art. V).\n\n109.\n\nMoreover, the CA itself confirms that the Parties in fact did not intend the receivables to be paid in installments. Indeed, the \"consideration\" for the assignment of the receivables, *i. e.* the nominal value of the receivables (and the interest.accrued until the time of the assignment) had to be *advanced under a loan facility* \"up to the sum of considerations for the receivables assigned\". In other words, the CA itself provided for an advance of the total sum of receivables under a loan agreement.\n\n110.\n\nArticle 3 CA expressly instructed CSOB and the Collection Companies to determine the terms and conditions of the refinancing under special agreements. As for the on-balance receivables, the repayment schedule attached to the Loan Agreement clearly functions as such \"schedule of payments for assigned receivables\". In fact, the Slovak Ministry of Finance expressly recognised in its confirmation of Article 7 of the Loan Agreement that the CA involved the repayment of the loan (and not of receivables) and that the Slovak Republic had an obligation to this effect. This consent and acknowledgement in the LA helps to construe the Parties\u2019 intentions and understanding pursuant to Section 266(3) of the Czech Commercial Code. Although the seven OBS Loan Agreements do not contain a similar (signed) acknowledgment, this does not remove the fact that in consenting to Article 7 LA, the MF SR accepted that the obligation referred to, based on the CA, consisted in the repayment of a loan and not in the payment for the assigned receivables. The Assignment Agreement, initialled on behalf of the Slovak Republic, confirms the same understanding when it states in Article III that the consideration to be paid at the day of the assignment was the amount of 100% nominal value of the receivables; such payment leaves no room for any schedule of payments in respect of these receivables.\n\n111.\n\nFurthermore, in the OBS Assignment Agreements (Art. IV), that became effective on December 31, 1993, *i.e.* the same day as the CA, SI recognised that SI\u2019s payment for the receivables would be covered by a loan from CSOB. Consequently, SI has confirmed that installment payments were to reimburse the loans and not the receivables. The Agreement on a Repayment Schedule Mechanisms for Off-Balance Instruments of March 1, 1996, clearly confirms that the Parties intended SI to repay the loans and not the off-balance receivables. Although the Slovak Republic was not a party to the agreement, it was aware of the mechanism through its executive and controlling function exercised within the Supervisory Board of SI.\n\n112.\n\nIn fact, the repayment of the loan was a lull substitute for the payment for the assigned receivables including interest accrued until the date of assignment. The schedule for both repayments would have been identical. However, the fact that the loss also ineluded payments of interest on the amount paid for the receivables according to the agreed schedule confirms that the parties had in mind the schedule of repayment of a loan rather than a schedule of payment for the receivables.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal has stated that the interpretation of Article 3 CA is governed by the provisions of Section 266 Commercial Code. Under paragraph 3 of this Section 266, the agreement has to be interpreted according to the intention of the Parties, taking into account all the circumstances related to the manifestation of will, including the negotiations about the conclusion of the contract in question and the Parties\u2019 subsequent conduct. It clearly was not the Parties\u2019 actual intention that the receivables would be paid in installments. When account is taken of all circumstances related to the manifestation of the Parties\u2019 will, it becomes apparent that when they used the term \"schedule of payment for the receivables\" they in fact intended \"schedule of payment of the loans obtained to pay the receivables\".\n\n114.\n\nEven if Section 35(2) Civil Code would be of some relevance for the interpretation of Article 3 CA, as contended by the Slovak Republic, this would not mean that the literal wording would become decisive. Indeed, as the Tribunal has stated, Section 35(2) Civil Code does not have the effect that verbal expressions used by the parties would prevail over their intention and understanding of the text. Moreover, contrary to the Slovak Republic's view, there is no such clear wording in Article 3 CA in respect of the schedule of payments referred to. Indeed, Article 3(II)(3) CA stipulates that a \"consideration\" is to be paid for the nominal value of the assigned receivables. Such consideration must cover the full value of the receivables. The \"schedule of payments\" must, therefore, refer to a payment to be made through installments. The only payment pertinent in this respect is the repayment of the loan. Further, when the same provision states that CSOB and the Collection Companies shall agree on a schedule for payments, reference is made to the \"refinancing\", *i.e.* the loan and not the receivables. Finally, the \"cover losses\" provision of Article 3(II)(5) CA refers to \"any losses\" made by the Collection Companies, not referring to any specific schedule of payments. The wording of these provisions is therefore not as clear as contended by the Slovak Republic and anyhow not clear enough to leave room for a strictly literal interpretation if Section 35(2) Civil Code would be considered as applicable and understood as calling for such an interpretation.\n\n*b. The occurrence of losses*\n-----------------------------\n\n115.\n\nCSOB argued that the term \"losses\" had in the context of the CA a specific meaning. It should not be understood in the sense of \"negative economic result, lack of funds or damage\". For the Slovak Republic, the term loss is capable of more than one meaning, producing different results. As the amount to be paid under the cover losses provision is not clearly stated or at least capable of determination, this provision is null and void.\n\n116.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the proper understanding of the term \"losses\" follows from the intermediate conclusion, also shared by the Parties, that the CA is to be analyzed as an innominate agreement. By its text, Article 3(II) CA attributes the losses to the respective Collection Companies. These Companies are designated in s\u00f9b-paragraphs 4 and 5 as the entities that will \"make losses\". As those losses derive from the \"nature of the assigned receivables\" and result from the schedule of payments and the operating costs (Art. 3(II)(4) CA), they are clearly identified as the Collection Companies negative bal-anee (or shortage of funds), due to the fact that the amounts collected from third party debtors (the FTOs) for the assigned receivables (representing the only income to be made) did not cover the repayment of the loan to CSOB and the operating costs. Such occurrence of losses made by the Collection Companies was a fact that explains the very essence and purpose of Article 3(II) CA.\n\n117.\n\nThe losses of SI would occur each time SI had to pay to CSOB under the schedule of payments but could not pay because of a negative balance that emerged in SI\u2019s accounts between the amount of receivables collected from third parties and the amount of payments to be made to CSOB. The occurrence of losses was thus related to the schedule of installments to be paid to CSOB, minus the (small) income produced by some of the receivables, and SI's operating costs. Such losses were therefore not equal to a single amount nor were they equal to installments for fixed amounts. The amount of SI\u2019s losses did further depend upon variables as SI\u2019s income and operating costs. Such a situation was envisaged by the drafters of Article 3(II) CA. The cover losses provision relates, indeed, to \"any losses\" and it ordered the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic to prepare a \"mechanism for covering any losses\" of SI (Art. 3(II)(5) CA). Such a \"mechanism\" makes sense only in a hypothesis where the amount representing the coverage changed in the course of the evolution of the loan facility extended to SI.\n\n*c. The selection and collection of the receivables assigned*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Slovak Republic further argues that the term \"losses\" and, consequently, the \"cover losses\" provision was inherently uncertain and the latter provision therefore null and void because the amount of losses is dependent on another set of uncertain factors, that relate to the volume of receivables to be assigned (which in turn depended upon the amount of reserves created by CSOB and CSOB's profitability in 1993), the allocation of receivables between SI and CI, the capital adequacy ratio to be achieved and the extent to which SI was able to make recoveries on its claims against FTOs. When the CA was concluded, the Slovak Republic contends, it was impossible to predict and to calculate the amount the Slovak Republic would have to cover. This amount could not objectively be calculated. Moreover, CSOB had a free hand in manipulating many factors so as to arrive at the result it wanted. In particular, CSOB had full discretion to select the most doubtful receivables to be transferred to CI or SI. The \"cover losses\" provision was thus non-binding because the losses to be paid were unknown at the moment the CA was entered into; nor could the respective amounts be calculated in an objective way later.\n\ni) The Slovak Republic's involvement, knowledge and acceptance\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThere is no doubt that the process for the selection of non-performing receivables to be assigned by CSOB to SI and the volume of assets to be transferred, as well as their value, had an impact on the potential losses of SI and the amount of losses to be covered under the provision of Article 3(II)(5) CA. The Parties to the CA had accepted that the selection of the receivables to be assigned was to be made on the basis of an agreement entered into by CSOB and SI (respectively CSOB and CI), such agreement containing also the \"specification of the various Non-Performing Assets\" (Art. 3(II)(2) CA). In fact, as this has been explained, the receivables were identified, depending the date of their respective maturities, in two distinct agreements, *i.e.* the Assignment Agreement (later completed by two amendments) and the Future Assignment Agreement (subsequently followed by the OBS Assignment Agreements). These agreements can be considered as part of the \"particular bilateral or multilateral agreements\" to be executed \"in the event that the performance of this Agreement [the CA] necessitates a more detailed regulation of the relationships among the various parties\", as stated in Article 7(1) CA. It was further stated specifically in Article 3(II)(2) *in fine* that the transfer of the assigned receivables was made \"pursuant to the above-referenced Government Resolutions\", which are those referred to in the Preamble.\n\n120.\n\nThus, it was accepted by all Parties to the CA, including the Slovak Republic, that the receivables to be transferred to SI were to be identified in agreements entered into by CSOB and SI, including the specification of their nominal value (plus interest accrued until the time of the assignment). It was therefore perfectly clear what the potential loss of SI would amount to, at least as a maximum figure (in case no receivable could be recovered). This disposes of the Slovak Republic's argument that the process of selection of receivables was such that SI\u2019s losses were uncertain.\n\n121.\n\nAs the Slovak Republic argues that there existed a fatal uncertainty at the time of the conclusion of the CA, it may still be argued that the certainty provided by the agreements subsequently concluded did not yet exist at that precise moment. However, Section 266(2) Commercial Code does not specify that the requirement for adequate identification of the object of the parties\u2019 obligations has to be met on the day of the conclusion of the agreement. Further, paragraph 3 of the same provision accepts that proper identification of part of a contract may be made in subsequent agreements. Moreover, as will be explained below, the maximum exposure to cover losses was also determined by the capital adequacy ratio of 6.25% specified as of December 31, 1993.\n\n122.\n\nIndeed, the Slovak Republic had precise knowledge of the potential losses of SI as it was involved in the selection of receivables to be assigned. The Slovak Republic was urged to appoint experts and bank examiners from the National Bank of Slovakia to inspect CSOB\u2019s loan portfolio and any other records pertinent to a proper implementation of the Consolidation Agreement, including the capital adequacy issue.47 A representative of the MF SR had been invited to participate in a working group to examine CSOB\u2019s portfolio of non-performing receivables in September 1993.48 As Mr. Magu\u00eda has indicated,49 as a member of the Supervisory Board of CSOB, he was, like the other members of this Board, entitled to inspect all documents and to insure that the shareholders\u2019 instructions were complied with. The MF SR, in exercising the function of Supervisory Board of SI, was invited to negotiate the assignment of CSOB's OBS receivables.50 The Slovak Republic was aware of the commitments SI had undertaken through SI\u2019s Supervisory Board, composed of high ranking officials of the MF SR. All the major SI agreements were presented to it. The Supervisory Board never has protested that the instructions of SI\u2019s sole shareholder, *i.e.* the Slovak Republic, had not been followed. Neither has the Slovak Republic objected. Besides, on February 13, 1997, an expert commission, established by CSOB and the MF SR, which included Dr. Papunova, a staff member of the MF SR, confirmed that the receivables had been correctly assigned to and accepted by SI.51\n\nCf. Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, No. 14-17, Exh. 3-5.\n\nLetter of CSOB to the National Bank of the Slovak Republic and to the MF SR, of September 10, 1992, Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 4.\n\nAffidavit of J. Magu\u00eda, supporting the Slovak Republic's Memorial on Jurisdiction, January 27, 1998, No. 5..\n\nLetter of CSOB, March 31, 1994, Statement of E. Kalinova, Exh. 5.\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 34.\n\n123.\n\nTo make the Slovak Republic's involvement and acceptance of the transfer of receivables even more clear, the Assignment Agreement and the Future Assignment Agreement were initialed by Mr. Magu\u00eda, then Chief Executive Director of the Section of Economic Policy of the MF SR. The Slovak Republic, through the person of Mr. Magu\u00eda, was thus aware of the specifics of the receivables to be assigned and it accepted such transfer to SI and, consequently, the potential losses suffered by SI.\n\n124.\n\nEqually explicit is the declaration signed by Mr. Filbus, then the Slovak Republic's Minister of Finance, on the bottom of the Loan Agreement, where he acknowledges the content of the LA that states specifically the details of SI\u2019s repayment obligation for the loan. Here again, the Slovak Republic declared to be perfectly aware of the amount of repayments owed by SI to CSOB.\n\n125.\n\nThe Slovak Republic furthermore argues that CSOB had not only a free hand in the selection of the receivables, but also in their collection. However, the collection was made by CSOB's employees performing activities for and on behalf of SI and under instruction of SI. The recovery of the transferred receivables was SI\u2019s activity and duty. SI was governed by its Supervisory Board, which was under the control of representatives of the Slovak Republic, SI\u2019s sole shareholder. SI\u2019s activity had an impact on its need for refinancing and the size of the loan extended by CSOB, but it did not interfere with the understanding and actual application of the CA.\n\n126.\n\nOne could still say that the amount of SI\u2019s losses was uncertain to the extent the result of SI\u2019s activity to collect the non-performing receivables was uncertain. However, this situation was an inherent part of the process set up in Article 3(II) CA and it was agreed upon by all Parties. The potential reduction of SI\u2019s exposure and loss was of no harm to the Slovak Republic, as it had the effect of reducing the amount of the repayment of the loan it had accepted to \"secure\" and did not, in fact, leave the Slovak Republic with any uncertainty. Indeed, when funds were collected from non-performing receivables and used to repay the loan, they had the immediate effect of reducing SI\u2019s potential loss. There did not exist any uncertainty at any given point in time about the amount of SI\u2019s payment obligation and loss in this respect. Consequently, there did not exist any uncertainty for the Slovak Republic either.\n\nii) The 6.25 % capital adequacy ratio\n-------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe privatisation plan required CSOB to reach an overall capital adequacy ratio of 6.25% by the end of 1993 to improve the financial standing of CSOB and to make it more attractive for privatisation. That explains also why the capital adequacy ratio had to improve to 7% at the end of 1994 (Art. 3(1) CA). In Article 3 CA, the ratio of 6.25% is relevant in two respects. First, CSOB had to create reserves to cover part of the nonperforming assets at an amount such that its capital adequacy at the close of 1993 was to be 6.25% (Art. 3(1) CA). Second, the amount of non-performing assets to be transferred to the Collection Companies was to be specified as at December 31, 1993, \"so that the actual capital adequacy of CSOB as of the same date amounts to 6.25%\".\n\n128.\n\nIn fact, more receivables were transferred to SI than necessary to reach the capital adequacy ratio of 6.25 %. As both Parties have told the Tribunal, a capital adequacy ratio of 6.49 % had actually been reached.52 The Slovak Republic argues that the assignments thus had gone beyond what was contractually foreseen and that the role of this capital adequacy ratio shows again how uncertain the content of the Parties\u2019 respective obligations under the CA were. This uncertainty is also demonstrated, in the Slovak Republic's view, by the fact that CSOB had full discretion to compose the bank's own capital, as the starting point for the calculation of the capital adequacy ratio.\n\nCf. Statement of K. Cloughsey, No. 6.\n\n129.\n\nDespite the difficulties of monitoring the process of its determination, the 6.25% capital adequacy ratio was in itself precise and imposed a clear target. Indeed, the drafters did use the direct notion \"amount\" and did not qualify it with \"about\" as they did in the same provision when they provided that for an \"about 3:1 ratio\" the receivables would be allocated between CI and SI.\n\n130.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to have a clear target; another whether the performance should never go beyond that clear target. It is admitted that the capital adequacy ratio is a regulatory minimum that CSOB was required to achieve. As the CA was concluded in order to prepare CSOB for privatisation and to make its acquisition financially more attractive, the capital adequacy ratio had a specific meaning in the consolidation operation. It would have been against the purpose of the CA had the capital adequacy ratio of 6.25% not been reached at the end of 1993. It would, however, not have been against this purpose had the ratio at the end of 1993 been higher, *e.g.* 6.49%, so that it would have been easier to reach the 7%, or an even higher ratio, at the end of 1994. The actual rate of 6.49% complies with the minimum requirement fixed by the CA. In fact, it is very difficult to reach exactly a target capital adequacy. Indeed, many components influence a capital adequacy calculation. Changes in any one component can significantly alter the final ratio. As a practical matter, the banks never achieve a ratio at the exact regulatory minimum, because, as one of CSOB\u2019s expert stated -\n\n... in order to hit that exactly, you would have to spend incredible amounts of money to monitor profit and monitor risk weighted assets.....It will not be cost effective.53\n\nTR, April 15.2003, 131:7-11 (Cloughesy).\n\n131.\n\nThe 6.25% rate had to be implemented on an overall basis, *i.e.* for the totality of assignments to CI and SI. It does not necessarily follow that the 6.25% rate also had to apply separately to each group of receivables assigned to CI and SI, respectively. The CA itself does not instruct to do so. Moreover, the receivables to be assigned to make CSOB reach the 6.25 % rate had to be allocated in a ratio of *about* 3:1 between CI and SI. SI had to agree on the exact division of receivables to be assigned to implement this \"about\" 3:1 ratio. In other words, SI had to explicitly accept the assignment of the specific receivables. Once the receivables were accepted, SI could no longer raise an objection that more receivables had been assigned to CI and SI than strictly required under the 6.25 % standard, nor that the assignments were not in conformity with the \"about 3:1\" split.\n\n132.\n\nIt is a fact that CSOB initially had all the necessary information about the receivables, their specification and the impact their transfer had on CSOB's capital adequacy ratio. CSOB\u2019s assessment of its capital adequacy at the close of 1993 was subject to the scrutiny and approval of the Bank\u2019s own Supervisory Board, which included a representative of the MF SR.\n\n133.\n\nMoreover, the receivables to be assigned had been audited, and information had been formally shared with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. CSOB had to propose the receivables to be selected for their assignment. SI and CI were given the opportunity to examine such proposals before giving their approval. CI and SI undoubtedly were in a position to oppose any over-transfer of receivables whenever not in conformity with the 6.25 % capital adequacy rate and the \"about 3:1\" ratio. They did not do so and they accepted the transfer of receivables as identified in the Assignment Agreement and the Future Assignment Agreement and their collateral agreements. Thus, CSOB and SI had selected and decided to transfer the non-performing assets as provided in Article 3(II)(2) CA. No criticism can be addressed to either SI or CSOB for having \"over transferred\" assets in light of the actual capital adequacy ratio compared to the ratio as fixed in that provision. Indeed, such a target was very difficult to reach at the precise date of December 31, 1993, and the ratio fixed at 6.25% was to be understood as a minimum and not as a maximum requirement, at least in the relations between CSOB and the Collection Companies.\n\n134.\n\nThe question has to be addressed, however, whether the Slovak Republic, given the fact that CSOB and SI accepted assignments over the 6.25% ratio, is bound by such an agreed \"over-assignment\". In other words, what are the effects of such \"over transfer\" on the meaning and operation of the cover losses provision of the CA ?\n\n135.\n\nCSOB has stated correctly that the Slovak Republic knew about the volume of the assignments through the information provided by CSOB and the executive functions it exercised in the Supervisory Board of SI. However, the obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses that is at issue in the instant case is exclusively based on the provisions of Article 3 CA. The involvement of the Slovak Republic in the asset selection process and its approval of the assignments to SI were not intended to and did not change the nature and scope of the cover losses obligation contained in Article 3(II)(5) CA, which is interrelated with the notion of losses as it is to be understood in light of paragraphs 2 to 4 of Article 3(II) CA, as explained above.\n\n136.\n\nIn respect of the assigned non-performing receivables, SI\u2019s losses relevant in the context of Article 3(II) CA could not go beyond the nominal value (plus interest accrued) on December 31, 1993 (without considering SI\u2019s operating costs). The overall scope of the assignments was determined, *inter alia,* by the precise figure of an actual capital adequacy of the amount of 6.25%. This figure was to be understood as a maximum figure, determining the extent to which the assigned receivables were able to trigger SI\u2019s losses relevant in respect of the cover losses obligation. If such a limitation had not been agreed upon by the parties to the CA, the CSOB/SI Agreements could have extended the volume of assets to be transferred without limit, thus extending equally without limit the cover losses undertaking stated in Article 3(II)(5) CA.\n\n137.\n\nAs has been stated, the 6.25% target was not necessarily directed as such to the sole assets to be transferred to SI. It was an overall figure relating to both CI and SI, the split between these Companies not being fully precise, because it had to be \"about\" 3:1 only. However, the Parties have not contended that this element plays a role in this respect and would not allow to retain the actual figure of 6.49% in respect of SI. The Tribunal notes that in this respect the amount of CSOB's FTO credit exposure was a main variable of its capital adequacy position as of December 31, 1993.54 As the Parties have not indicated either on what precise amount of transferred receivables they rely when referring to this 6.49% ratio, the Tribunal includes those receivables that CSOB identified as receivables transferred to SI.\n\nStatement of K. Cloughesy, No. 18.\n\n138.\n\nIn order to determine how to deal with the \"over-draw\" of 0.24%, the Tribunal is of the view that the capital adequacy ratio served to fix a limit on the total exposure under the \"cover losses\" undertaking of Article 3(II)(5) CA. Therefore, the total loss to be covered was not to go beyond an amount that would raise this ratio over 6.25%. There is no need to identify any receivable that might represent the \"over-draw\". This matter will have to be dealt with further when the amount of receivables relevant in this respect is identified.\n\n*2. The losses related to the operating costs*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nArticle 3(II)(4) CA states that the Collection Companies\u2019 loss will result from the \"operating costs\", in addition to the losses resulting from the schedule of payments to be made to CSOB. The preceding sub-paragraph that deals with the payment for the receivables as \"consideration\" and CSOB's loan facility towards the Collection Companies, mentions that \"CSOB shall provide a loan to cover the 1994 operating costs\". The Operation Agreement concluded between CSOB and SI included a quarterly fee of SKK 1.5 million and a percentage of the amount collected to be agreed upon for each collection on an individual basis (Art. IV/1). It also stipulated that CSOB would provide a loan for the purpose of the payment of fees, if the collection of assets of SI during 1994 was not sufficient to cover such payment (Art. IV/3.1). It was added that the repayment of such a loan was \"guaranteed\" by the MF SR under the CA (Art. IV/3.2). The Operation Agreement was one of the various collateral agreements implementing the CA. Its content was fully known to the Slovak Republic, as it was initialed by Mr. Magu\u00eda, representing the MF SR, and had as contracting party SI, directed by the Slovak Republic as its sole shareholder.\n\n140.\n\nThe CA, as explained, included SI\u2019s operating costs in the notion of losses. This did not create any uncertainty or lack of identification of the obligation based on the \"cover losses\" provision. Indeed, the contracting parties to the CA agreed to have the amount of operating costs to be settled between CSOB and the respective Collection Companies. As the Operation Agreement shows, this has been done in respect of SI, to the full knowledge of the Slovak Republic. There existed therefore complete legal clarity about the costs accruing and their determination and, consequently, about their impact on the amount of losses to be covered under the cover losses provision. In fact, CSOB charged SI the quarterly fee through SI\u2019s accounts, reducing accordingly the amount of collected assets on these accounts. Thus, the balance of SI\u2019s obligation towards CSOB was recognizable, in this respect as well, and the Slovak Republic was in a position to know at any time the exposure triggered by the concept of \"losses\" under the CA. The Slovak Republic had every opportunity to object to the handling of SI\u2019s management fees; it did never do so at the relevant time.\n\n141.\n\nIt has been argued, on behalf of the Slovak Republic, that parts of SI\u2019s management fees were charged unduly and should be credited to SI, thus reducing SI\u2019s loss.55 However, such a matter relates to the legal relations between CSOB and SI, governed by the Operation Agreement, and that is outside this Tribunal's jurisdiction. What matters in respect of CSOB's claim against the Slovak Republic is exclusively the actual state of SI\u2019s loss as it appears on the face of SI\u2019s assets and liabilities. Merely potential claims of SI, that are anyhow, as will be explained later, unsupported, do not constitute assets to be taken into account for the determination of SI\u2019s losses.\n\nExpert Opinion of D. Frishberg (Deloitte & Touche), Nos 38, 39; Rejoinder, Nos 75-78.\n\nE. The Obligation to Cover Losses under Article 3 CA\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argues that in addition to the unclear meaning of the term \"losses\" it is equally not clear what the CA means by the \"coverage\" of the losses. Does \"cover losses\" mean that the Slovak Republic had to pay to SI or did it have to pay directly to CSOB ? Would the Slovak Republic have \"covered\" the losses when it were to pay SI, had SI not passed the funds on to CSOB ? Does the \"cover losses\" provision contain any payment obligation, or did it oblige the MF SR only to prepare a mechanism that would allow implementation of a payment obligation agreed upon at a later stage ?\n\n143.\n\nThe Slovak Republic further argues that even if the \"cover losses\" provision contained an obligation of the Slovak Republic to make payments in support of SI, such obligation did not have CSOB as beneficiary, as no mention of CSOB was made in this provision. Therefore, CSOB had no title (or \"standing\") to sue as it does in this dispute.\n\n144.\n\nFor CSOB, when the Slovak Republic had to \"cover\" the losses, it meant that it had to provide CSOB with some kind of security for the repayment of the loan, but the specific form that security and payment had to take was not determined by the CA itself, with the proviso, however, that the MF SR was obliged to prepare the necessary \"mechanism\". For CSOB, there is no doubt that it was the beneficiary of the \"cover losses\" obligation and thus entitled to direct its claim against the Slovak Republic.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal has dealt above with the Slovak Republic's further suggestion that the \"cover losses\" obligation of the CA was intended to be a security but failed to be in the proper form of a \"security\", *i.e.* the nominate contract under Czech law. As it was not a proper security for CSOB, it was not valid and the loans granted by CSOB therefore unsecured. However, the \"cover losses\" obligation is not a \"guarantee\" or a \"security\" of this kind. Despite various controversies on terminology, the Parties both based their argumentation on the understanding that the CA is an innominate contract that parties could agree upon pursuant to their contractual liberty.\n\n*1. The Slovak Republic's involvement in the negotiation of the cover losses provision*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe CA was negotiated extensively over five months. Mr. Magu\u00eda, at that time Chief Executive Director of the Section of Economic Policy of the MF SR,56 as well as a member of CSOB's Supervisory Board, was present at six of the meetings. As the CA itself indicates, all Parties, including the Slovak Republic, were aware that \"It follows from the nature of the assigned receivables that the Collection Companies would make a loss.\" The certainty of the Collection Companies\u2019 losses was the very basis for and the genesis of the CA.57 The Slovak Republic had full opportunity to participate and intervene in this process, as negotiator and party of the CA and through its presence on the Board of CSOB.\n\nAffidavit of J. Magu\u00eda, supporting the SR's Memorial on Jurisdiction, January 27.1998, No. 4.\n\nFor the negotiation history of the CSOB see, in particular, Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek in support of Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, April 30, 1998, together with the Annexes containing the Minutes of meetings and the draft proposals.\n\n147.\n\nDuring the negotiations - a period very relevant to the interpretation of an agreement according to Section 266 Commercial Code - the Slovak Republic knew what was understood by the losses it had to cover. Indeed, on the basis of the draft agreement of December 1993, it has estimated its expenditure till 2003 under the CA, in other words it was aware of the amount of losses it expected to have to cover. Consequently, the Slovak Republic's own behavior shows that the Slovak Republic understood what was covered by the notion of \"losses\". Moreover, the initial draft agreement, that was prepared by the MF SR, provided already that the contracting parties (then the Czech and the Slovak Republics) had to agree that the Finance Ministries of both Republics \"shall bear the losses of the collection unit equally\" and that the \"planned distribution of losses coverage spans from the year 1995 until the year 2003\".58 The subsequent drafts prepared by CSOB contained the cover losses provision as it was adopted in Article 3(II) CSOB.59 Therefore, there could not exist any surprise, doubt or lack of clarity in respect of the Slovak Republic's undertaking.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek in support of Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, April 30, 1998, Exh. J.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek in support of Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, April 30, 1998, Exh. M and N.\n\n148.\n\nThe Working Group that was appointed by the Slovak Republic's Government to deal with stage II of the restructuring of CSOB charged the Minister of Finance -\n\nto make provisions for the expenditures intended for the coverage of losses of the collection company in the State budget, commencing in the year 1995 and ending 2003.\n\nThe Resolution No. 937 of the Government of the Slovak Republic of December 15, 1993 that appointed the Slovak Republic's Working Group, also recognized the proposal for the project for stage II that had been prepared by the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia. This proposal stated in its rationale -\n\nWith account taken of the fact that CSOB is active in both Republics, the participation of both states in the coverage of losses from bad loans and guarantees will be necessary, (page 6, emphasis in the original)\n\nIt was further stated that bad assets in a total amount of approximately SKK 9.3 billion would be transferred to the Collection Company in the Slovak Republic and that the total estimated net expenditures of the state budget of the Slovak Republic would amount to at most approximately SKK 13.3 billion until 2003 (page 7). As a result, no doubt can remain that the Slovak Republic had therefore full knowledge, not only of its obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses, but also of the scope of its exposure and the need to provide for the necessary budget.60\n\nAs Mr. Knapp put it: arc.. this required final calculation and final approval, but the magnitude was known already.... The exact figure of course was not known but in general both parties had very good knowledge of what it is about and what will be the total costs and what also is expected then from [the] privatisation process.\" TR, April 15.2003, 98: 17/18.22-25.\n\n*2. The meaning of \"cover losses \"*\n-----------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAs the Tribunal has stated on various occasions, the CA stands on its own and Article 3 CA constitutes an innominate agreement to be considered under the pertinent provisions of the Czech Commercial Code. When Section 269 of this Code requires that such agreement identifies \"adequately\" the object of the parties obligations, this does not mean that all details have to be spelled out. It is sufficient that the parties, in light of the pertinent elements for the interpretation of the manifestation of their will (Section 266 Commercial Code) understand the essentials of their obligations or know the pertinent elements of their further determination or implementation.61 Furthermore, under Czech contract law - in conformity with general principles of contract law \u2014, it is not required that the amount to be paid should be known when the agreement is entered into; it is sufficient that at the moment when the performance is due, it is objectively quantifiable *(e.g. Art.* 409(2) Czech Commercial Code in respect of contract of sale). As the Slovak Republic was in a position to measure precisely SI\u2019s loss and its evolution at any point in time (at least at each quarter), the Slovak Republic surely was able to objectively quantify its obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses.\n\nSection 37 Civil Code, that requires that the parties\u2019 declaration be \"definite and intelligible\", is, contrary to the Slovak Republic's view, not applicable to Article 3 CA, and it would anyhow not lead to another conclusion than Section 269 Commercial Code.\n\n150.\n\nAs the language of the cover losses provision shows, the Slovak Republic had been offered more than one way to implement its obligation to cover losses. Indeed, this obligation directed the Slovak Republic to achieve the goal of \"covering\", *i.e.* removing or replacing SI\u2019s losses, but it did not impose on the Slovak Republic a particular method to achieve this goal. It requested the Slovak Republic, however, to prepare a mechanism that would permit reaching the required result. It is not disputed that the Slovak Republic did not implement such a mechanism nor provide for the necessary funds on the State's budget. It is clear that the non-existence of such a prepared mechanism cannot serve as an argument to raise an objection based on an alleged lack of clarity of the basic obligation to cover losses when required.\n\n151.\n\nThe decisions of the Czech Supreme Court, which the Slovak Republic invokes to sustain its argument that Article 3 does not indicate what is meant by \"cover losses\" and therefore is illegal, are not relevant. All these decisions concerned flagrant cases where it was not clear whether parties intended a gift or a sale;62 or where there was no objective way to determine the ultimate sales price;63 or where all relevant elements in respect of the rights and duties associated with the membership of a cooperative building society were missing.64 In the case at stake, on the contrary, it was clear that the Slovak Republic would cover SI\u2019s losses, in order to protect CSOB against the most probable risk that loaned sums to SI most likely would not be reimbursed. As the Slovak Republic would ultimately make a profit from the transaction, it had to make this investment.\n\nDecision of October 7, 1998, No. 1 Odon 110/97.\n\nDecision of August 31, 1999. In this case, no ruling on the validity of the agreement was made. The case was remanded to the appellate court to complete the facts in relation to the price arrangement.\n\nDecision of February 7.2001, No. 29 Cdo 1402/99.\n\n152.\n\nAs an equivalent to the MF SR's undertaking to \"cover\" SI\u2019s losses, Article 3(II)(5) CA uses the expression that such losses shall be \"compensated\". The same undertaking covers \"any\" losses. This means that all of SI\u2019s losses, as identified under the provisions of Article 3(II) CA, are to be covered, respectively compensated, and this at any time they occur. The undertaking to cover SI\u2019s losses implied payments to be made at regular intervals, corresponding to the intervals fixed in the agreed schedule of payments, when SI had to pay the installments of CSOB's loan, over the period 1995-2003, but lacked the funds necessary to meet its obligation. That is the reason why the MF SR was required to prepare a \"mechanism\" to ensure a periodic flow of coverage for SI\u2019s losses. The Slovak Republic thus had to provide SI with funds or assets to compensate for the loss it had to suffer because the recovery from the assigned receivables was insufficient to fully repay the loan and the operating costs. In this way, SI would keep the proper financing to meet its obligations towards CSOB.\n\n153.\n\nThe losses to be covered were SI\u2019s losses. In the ordinary course of dealings, the payments to be made by the Slovak Republic to cover those losses would have to be directed to SI. The Slovak Republic has argued, however, that this demonstrates that the cover losses provision hereby shows another face of its inherent uncertainty, as such payments made to SI would not have ensured that CSOB ultimately would be paid. The Tribunal does not accept this argument. First, as the Slovak Republic has not made any payment to cover SI\u2019s losses, such assertion is purely hypothetical. Second, and more importantly, such a refusal of SI to transfer the Slovak Republic's payment to CSOB would imply that the Slovak Republic, after it had paid the amount necessary to cover SI\u2019s losses, would refuse, when acting within SI\u2019s Supervisory Board, to forward the same money to its final destination, CSOB. Such a behavior would represent a gross violation of the principle of good faith and of Article 2(2) of the BIT, resulting in a breach of the Consolidation Agreement.\n\n154.\n\nAs a matter of fact, another way to effectively cover SI\u2019s losses could have been a direct payment from the Slovak Republic to CSOB, to the benefit of SI, thus reducing SI\u2019s repayment obligation and its potential loss. As the Slovak Republic had not prepared any mechanism for the coverage of SI\u2019s losses nor the necessary funds on its budget, this variant to allow compliance with the cover losses obligation need not to be further discussed.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the cover losses provision of Article 3(II)(5) CA identifies adequately and in a definite and understandable manner the Slovak Republic's obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses as soon as and to the extent as the recovery of the assigned receivables did not allow to repay CSOB's loan according to the agreed schedule of payments and taking into account SI\u2019s operating costs.\n\n*3. The Slovak Republic's obligation to cover STs losses*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nConsidering again the basic rules on the interpretation of the manifestation of will of Section 266 Commercial Code, the Tribunal finds that all relevant circumstances for the understanding of the content of the cover losses provision of Article 3(B)(5) CA lead to the conclusion that the Slovak Republic had accepted a legally binding undertaking to make the necessary payments in order to allow the coverage of SI\u2019s losses.\n\n157.\n\nDuring the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the CA, as explained, the representatives of the Slovak Republic were aware of the precise operation of Article 3(II) CA, the need for each Republic to cover the losses of its respective Collection Company and the budgetary funds needed to give effect to such undertaking, as much as the Slovak Republic was aware of the profit it was going to make through the consolidation and subsequent privatisation of CSOB. The documentation supporting Resolution No. 937/93 of the Government of the Slovak Republic, referred to and quoted above, represents the most pertinent evidence in this respect.\n\n158.\n\nThe wording of Article 3(II)(5) CA leaves no doubt about the basic obligation of each Republic, acting through its Ministry of Finance, to provide for the \"compensation\" of the Collection Companies\u2019 losses over the period 1995-2003 and to \"cover any losses\" made by these Companies in its respective territory.\n\n159.\n\nEqually clear is the declaration signed by Mr. Filbus, then the Slovak Republic's Minister of Finance, at the end of the Loan Agreement, where he \"consents to and acknowledges the contents\" of the LA that states specifically the details of SI\u2019s repayment obligation for the loan. This declaration confirms the MF SR's obligation to \"secure\" such repayment under the CA. This means that the Slovak Republic had full knowledge of SI\u2019s exposure to CSOB and declared to confirm that the repayment would finally be \"secured\" by the Slovak Republic. As no other provision than Article 3(II)(5) of the CA is related to such an obligation, this confirmation, declared by the Slovak Republic, is clearly based on and refers to the CA's cover losses provision. The fact that a similar declaration attached to the Future Assignment Agreement has not been signed on behalf of the Slovak Republic does not remove the Slovak Republic's obligation under the CA, which did not require any further confirmation. The declaration attached to the LA shows that the Slovak Republic accepted that an obligation to secure the repayment of the Ioan existed under the CA. Such an obligation covers necessarily all receivables assigned pursuant to the provisions of Article 3(II)(2) CA, including both on-balance and off-balance sheet receivables. This is further confirmed by Articles 1(b) and 2 LA, that refer expressly to loans related to OBS items and that are included in the MF SR's consent declaration.\n\n160.\n\nThe Slovak Republic did argue that under Slovak law, the Slovak Minister of Finance had no power to make such a declaration on behalf of the Slovak Republic.65 The evidence shows, to the contrary, that the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic was authorized by the Working Group appointed by virtue of Resolution No. 937 of the Government of the Slovak Republic of December 15, 1993 to enter into a master agreement and to prepare and to enter into the required partial agreements for the purpose of implementing stage II of CSOB's restructuring.\n\nOpinion of J. Drgonec, No. 25, 128, 211, 214; Rejoinder Opinion J. Drgonec, No. 27, 33. This expert advise does not contain any mention of the cited Government Resolution No. 937\n\n161.\n\nThe main line of the Slovak Republic's argumentation in these proceedings,66*i.e.* that the cover losses obligation is in various respects not definite, not understandable and uncertain, and thus null and void, is contradicted by the position taken by the Slovak Republic's representatives over an extended period of time. Thus, during the negotiations preparing for the conclusion of the CA, as well as in the years of the CA's subsequent practical application, they never raised doubts or objections in respect of the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation. In this way they demonstrated effectively that the provisions of the CA were fully understandable, certain and definite to the Slovak Republic. Any contrary position, as taken by the Slovak Republic in these proceedings, is unsupported by all relevant circumstances of interpretation under the applicable Czech law and, moreover, it does not comply with Article 2(2) of the BIT, which was incorporated into the CA and requires the Slovak Republic to treat CSOB fairly and in an equitable way and to give its investment full protection and security in the Slovak Republic.\n\nAt least in the merits phase. In its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction (p. 68), the Slovak Republic submitted \"that the meaning of the Consolidation Agreement is clear on its face and, if any further evidence were needed, it is supplied by the negotiating history. Because the contract is not ambiguous, no further rules of contractual interpretation are necessary.\"\n\n162.\n\nThe Slovak Republic's subsequent conduct - another source on which to assess and construe the meaning of a contract provision under Section 266 Commercial Code - confirms that the Slovak Republic clearly knew and accepted what was meant by its obligation to \"cover losses\". Through various set-off agreements concluded between the MF SR, SI and FTOs (Technopol, Chirana, Martimex) in 1994 and 1995,67 the Slovak Republic confirmed that SI did dispose of a receivable validly assigned by CSOB to SI. The MF SR accepted to enter into discussions with CSOB on the provision of resources on the state budget that would allow the repayment of CSOB's loan. CSOB was ensured by the Slovak Republic's Minister of Finance that in 1996, the proposed budget would include an amount for SI covering both 1995 and 1996.68 By the end of 1995, the MF SR agreed to propose to the Government that SKK 3 billions from the budget of the Slovak National Property Fund could be used for SI.69 The MF SR had been provided by SI with \"detailed quantification required from the state budget for 1995-1996\".70 At no time during these discussions did any representative of the Slovak Republic question the nature or the extent of the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation under the CA.71 However, the Slovak Republic failed to include in the budget amounts for funding SI.\n\nStatement of E.

In a \"Guarantor's Letter of Information\", issued on December 22, 1997 by the State Secretary of the MF SR,74 it was stated that the MF SR was obliged to ensure that SI had sufficient funds to make payments on SI\u2019s of some SKK 10.7 billions, and that the MF SR recognized that \"to date such payments have not been made in a timely manner\". In statements made to the press, on May 25, 1998, June 1, 1998 and August 11, 2001, as well as in the \"Black Book\" released in January 1999, the Slovak Republic repeatedly recognized that it had to pay CSOB because of SI\u2019s failure to reimburse the loans.75\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 18. Contrary to what the Slovak Republic contends (TR, November 12, 2002, 172:16-173.16), this statement was not a general statement, inspired by practical considerations and not considered as a legal acknowledgement. This is unconvincing as the purpose of the statement was to assure third parties. Indeed, the statement was legally significant as it had the purpose to assure CSOB about the MF SR's willingness to complete stage II of CSOB's restructuring and to recognize the Slovak Republic's obligation under the CA. It further served CSOB to satisfy its auditors (Statement P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 19, TR, November 11, 2002, 156:9-25) and to classify the SI loan as a \"standard\" loan (Reply Statement P.

Other complaints of this kind had been raised in late 1996 and early 1997,76 but no statement made by the Slovak Republic in this respect disputed the MF SR's cover losses obligation under the *CK.77* The expert commission jointly set up by CSOB and the MF SR concluded on February 13, 1997 that no imperfections in respect of the assigned receivables had been discovered.78 In response to CSOB's letter of April 10, 1997, calling SI to pay all drawn loans, SI asked in its letter of April 24, 1997 for postponement of the due payments until December 31, 1997 because it was \"unable to pay its obligation to your bank\".79 No objection to the existence and scope of this obligation was raised.\n\nCf. Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, No. 35, 36, 38, 39.41,42, Exh. 26, 27.29, 31.32, 34.\n\nStatement of P. Knapp, No. 22 and Exh. 4.\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 34\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 37.\n\n165.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has argued that these repeated confirmations of the Slovak Republic\u2019s duty to pay are set aside by the fact that CSOB did not request firm compliance with Article 3 CA. On the contrary, *e.g.* on September 4, 1995, when SI was in default of payments, CSOB explored the possibility of whether the Slovak Republic would grant a specific state guarantee.80 In October, CSOB again invited the Slovak Republic to ensure repayment of CSOB\u2019s loan to SI. A letter was addressed by SI to the MF SR on December 22, 1995, requesting the MF SR to regard its liability towards SI as being secured by a State guarantee. For CSOB, such an endorsement by the MF SR of its obligation would have allowed the SI loan to be given a classification that would have satisfied CSOB's auditors and the bank regulating authorities of the Slovak Republic. Ultimately, the MF SR's letter stating that there \"were no legally ambiguous obligations\" in the CA resolved the auditing and reporting requirements and the proposed agreement was not signed.81\n\nMinutes of meeting, Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 7.\n\nCf. Reply Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, No. 3-14.\n\n166.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, these requests for an explicit guarantee, which remained unsuccessful, indicate that the Slovak Republic was not obliged under the CA to pay CSOB. Article 3 did not specify the mechanisms to cover losses; any number of methods could have been employed.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the request for a specific guarantee is a - belated - request to the Slovak Republic to secure properly its existing obligation for covering SI\u2019s losses. The fact that the Slovak Republic did not issue a guarantee is no indication that Article 3 is not binding. It means only that the Slovak Republic was not prepared to undertake such a further step to strengthen the enforcement of its liability under the CA. The December 22, 1995 proposal stated clearly that it \"will merely endorse the obligations of the MF SR\" pertaining to the CA. The purpose was manifestly to provide SI, and ultimately CSOB, with a security that, while assuring the Slovak Republic's compliance with an already existing and at that time not disputed obligation of the Slovak Republic to cover SI\u2019s losses, would have satisfied CSOB's regulatory requirements.\n\n*4. CSOB's right to claim*\n--------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Slovak Republic further contends that CSOB is not designated as the beneficiary of the cover losses provision and that even if CSOB had had any title to claim, it has no actual interest on the basis of which it can bring a claim against the Slovak Republic.\n\n169.\n\nIn respect of the first item, the Slovak Republic notes that the cover losses provision does even not mention CSOB. It is argued that this is in line with the nature of the CA that can create mutual obligations and rights between states only.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it cannot be disputed that CSOB is a party to the CA with its own rights and obligations. It contracted various obligations towards the Slovak Republic (as well as the Czech Republic). In particular, CSOB undertook to call a General Meeting that would resolve to increase the registered capital (Art. 2 CA), it accepted to improve its balance (Art. 3 CA), to develop its business in the Slovak Republic (Art. 5 CA), and to establish a subsidiary in the Slovak Republic (Art. 6). In respect of the cover losses provision, while it is true that it does not mention CSOB expressly, it is said in the provisions above that CSOB undertakes to transfer non-performing assets to SI (Art. 3(II)(2) CA), that CSOB will be paid for these assets and will provide SI with a loan (Art. 3(II)(3) CA), which will ultimately create SI\u2019s loss that the Slovak Republic undertakes to cover. The heading of part II of Article 3 CA mentions the \"Transfer of CSOB's Non-Performing Assets to the Collection Companies\", a transaction that could not be envisaged without having CSOB as a party to it. Moreover, the above stated heading of Section 2 of Article 3 CA states that \"the parties hereto have agreed to cover the Non-Performing Assets\", thereby referring necessarily to the parties of the CA, ineluding CSOB. The Slovak Republic did not explain how the cover losses provision of the Consolidation Agreement could operate as a state-to-state undertaking from the Slovak Republic towards the Czech Republic. The Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation can only make sense if it entitles CSOB to claim from the Slovak Republic that it effectively provides SI with the funds necessary to meet SI\u2019s obligation to repay CSOB's loan. The fact that CSOB had to be involved and that it had to grant a loan to the Collection Companies, implies that CSOB had to be secured in the likely occurrence that the Collection Companies were to make losses. The Slovak Republic's denial of CSOB's title to request from the Slovak Republic that SI\u2019s losses are covered would deprive CSOB from any meaningful protection for its loan and thus breach the Slovak Republic's commitment to let CSOB \"enjoy full protection and security\" as stated in Article 2(2) BIT that the parties agreed to incorporate into the CA. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the Slovak Republic's contention that CSOB has no title to claim under the cover losses provision of the CA.\n\n171.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also denies CSOB any actual interest on the basis of which it can bring a claim against the Slovak Republic under the cover losses provision of the CA. Indeed, after the present arbitration proceedings had commenced in 1997, CSOB concluded an assignment agreement with the Czech Republic on April 24, 1998,82 which was superseded on June 25, 199883 by a second agreement. The purpose of these agreements was to improve CSOB\u2019s financial situation in view of its privatisation.\n\nReply Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 9.\n\nReply Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 10.\n\n172.\n\nUnder the second assignment agreement, CSOB undertook to assign to the Czech Republic on a so-called \"effective date\" all claims CSOB had against SI under the LA relating to the receivables transferred to the latter as well as the claims CSOB had against the Slovak Republic under the CA. The \"effective date\" is three days after the date on which the Czech Republic receives in writing CSOB's request for delivery of the receivables and the rights attached thereto. However, the Czech Republic does not have the right to request the assignment prior to the completion of the instant arbitration proceedings. In case of these proceedings not being completed by December 31, 2002, the Czech Republic was required to pay a deposit for the payment of the \"consideration\" amounting to 90% of the agreed upon nominal value of the receivables at that date. Were CSOB to receive any payment in settlement of the receivables, 75% of the consideration related to such payment has to be reimbursed to the Czech Republic. Whenever the Czech Republic obtains such payment after the assignment of any receivable, CSOB remains entitled to 25% of any amount received.\n\n173.\n\nThe second assignment agreement was amended on October 31, 2001.84 The due date for payment to CSOB of the deposit for the consideration for the assignment of receivables to the Czech Republic was postponed until after completion of the arbitration proceedings, but no earlier than December 31, 2004. The Amendment denominated the consideration in Czech crowns. It established a variable component of the consideration based on interest on the outstanding fixed component of the consideration. Further, the percentage of the consideration to be reduced in case of payments collected by CSOB was increased from 75% to 85% for payments received as from January 1, 2003; the same percentage were to apply to the amount of the Czech Republic's deposit that would have to be returned to the latter after January 1, 2005.\n\nAdditional documents produced by CSOB pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, on June 13.2002, Tab 1.\n\n174.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has argued that, because of these assignment agreements, CSOB has no longer standing to claim in this arbitration as in fact the Czech Republic became the party interested to obtain a payment from the Slovak Republic. The circumstance that the assignments would not take place before three days after the termination of the arbitration proceedings was - in Slovak Republic\u2019s view - a mere artifice to maintain CSOB as a party in the present proceedings. In fact, the Czech Ministry of Finance has. stated on its web site that the Czech Republic - *i.e.* not CSOB - would win the dispute. Moreover, in its Annual Report 2001, CSOB has dropped the receivable related to SI from its balance sheet and has replaced it by a Czech Republic receivable. The receivable against SI was transferred to the off-balance sheet.\n\n175.\n\nHowever, the Arbitral Tribunal already has decided in its First Decision on Jurisdiction that CSOB is the real party in interest.85 Consequently, CSOB has standing and title to claim.\n\nFirst Decision on Jurisdiction, No 28-32.\n\n**V.** The Receivables That Could Trigger Losses Under Article **3 CA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe losses that the Slovak Republic had to cover could result from SI\u2019s operating costs and from the payments to be made to CSOB to repay CSOB's loan, the amount of which was equivalent to the amount of the consideration paid by SI at the time of the assignment of the selected non-performing receivables. Such selection was based on two distinct agreements, *i.e.* the Assignment Agreement (later completed by two amendments) and the Future Assignment Agreement (subsequently followed by the OBS Assignment Agreements). The Slovak Republic as a party to the CA was bound by these CSOB/SI Agreements in respect of the identification of the assigned receivables as provided for in Article 3(II)(2) CA.\n\n177.\n\nThe Slovak Republic and CSOB disagree on which receivables have actually been properly assigned as provided for by Article 3(II)(2) CA. The assignments of some \"On-Balance Sheet\" receivables as well as of some \"Off-Balance Sheet\" receivables are in dispute.\n\nA. On-Balance Sheet Receivables\n-------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe total amount of CSOB's receivables transferred to SI through the Assignment Agreement was 6,521,108.081.91 Slovak Crowns (hereinafter \"SKK.\"), representing the \"balances of contractual and forced loans denominated in Crowns and foreign currencies as of December 31, 1993\" (Art. I). The Amendment No. 1 dated August 16, 1994 reduced this amount by SKK 51,668,195. The Amendment No. 2 dated May 31, 1995 increased the amount by SKK 86,948,277.04, corresponding to a newly transferred receivable from Omnia.\n\n179.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argued that CSOB had engaged in aggressive lending to the FTOs in late 1993, years after the end of the command economy, and then shunted those late loans to SI. The Slovak Republic contended that this was inconsistent with the agreed purpose of the CSOB/SI Agreements and that therefore a reduction of CSOB's claim of SKK 7,022,989.051 (including interest) should be made. It is not certain whether this request that does not appear in later submissions, has been formally withdrawn by the Slovak Republic. However, the Tribunal notes that the provisions of Article 3(II) CA do not give room to investigate into the origin and nature of the respective non-performing receivables. In the Tribunal's view, the Slovak Republic is bound by the assignments that have been validly agreed upon by CSOB and SI in compliance with Article 3(II)(2) CA.\n\n*1. The devaluation loans*\n--------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argues that among the \"On-Balance Sheet\" receivables, there were receivables for a value of SKK 1,011,426.185 that were not \"non-performing\" as of December 31, 1993 and thus did not fall under the qualification of the \"Non-Performing Assets\" to be transferred under Article 3(II)(2) CA.\n\n181.\n\nThese receivables were related to devaluation loans, granted by CSOB to three FTOs (Technopol, Chirana and Martimex) in order to allow them to honour their obligations in foreign currencies after the devaluation of the Czechoslovakian Crown in 1990. On December 30, 1992, CSOB and the MF SR had entered into a \"Devaluation Agreement\"86 whereby the Slovak Republic accepted to reimburse CSOB certain of the FTO\u2019s devaluation related losses, for a total amount of 1,900,980.000 Czechoslovakian Crowns (hereinafter \"KCS\"); the reimbursements were meant to reduce the indebtedness of the FTOs to CSOB (Art. II). Consequently, in the Slovak Republic's view, because CSOB had obtained a direct guarantee from the Slovak Republic to reimburse these loans, the receivables could not be considered as non-performing. Thus, in the Slovak Republic\u2019s view, the damage claimed by CSOB should have been reduced by SKK 3,068,497.860, consisting of SKK 1,011,426.185 of principal and SKK 2,057,071.675 of interest as of December 31, 2002.87\n\nReply Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 18; Expert Opinion of D. Frishberg, Exh. 21.\n\nRejoinder of D. Frishberg, para. 87.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Devaluation Agreement, concluded in 1992, foresaw that the Slovak Republic would pay KCS 833,100,000 to CSOB for these receivables in 1993 and KCS 1,067,880.000 in 1994. On October 25, 1993, CSOB and Konsolidacna Banka (KBB) concluded an agreement whereby the latter purchased for SKK 724,020,000 part of these receivables and obtained from CSOB a loan for the same amount at an interest rate of 16.5% until October 31, 1996.88 This arrangement had the effect of reducing the outstanding obligations that were later transferred to SI. At the time of the CA's conclusion, the Slovak Republic had agreed to the inclusion of the remaining receivables related to the devaluation losses in the CA that was then under preparation.89 It is not contested that the Slovak Republic agreed to such inclusion while it had full knowledge of the Devaluation Agreement and the agreement concluded with Konsolidacna Banka. The handling of the respective assets by the Supervisory Board of SI shows that their transfer was made properly and was accepted.90 The Slovak Republic's argument presented in these proceedings appears therefore as the opposite to its prior position.\n\nReply Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 2. See further TR, April 15, 2003, 72:12-76:2, 122:14-128:3 (Knapp).\n\nThese loans were put on the list of receivables assigned and they were mentioned in the KPMG report on CSOB's credit exposures as well as in the Proposal of the Slovak Republic of December 1993. Cf. Reply Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, No. 43 and 44, Statement of P. Knapp, Exh. 2.\n\nCf. Reply Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, No. 18-24.\n\n183.\n\nThe argument now raised by the Slovak Republic is that the Devaluation Agreement operated as a \"guarantee\" to give CSOB full protection with regard to the payments of the devaluation loans. The Tribunal observes that the Devaluation Agreement states an obligation to \"reimburse\" and does not contain the notion of a \"guarantee\". Further, the particulars of the agreement with Konsolidacna Banka show that the Slovak Republic did not satisfy its direct payment obligations toward CSOB under the Devaluation Agreement as they were agreed. In fact, the Slovak Republic never did so even later. As Section 266 Commercial Code indicates, the practices introduced between the Parties and the subsequent conduct are important parts of the circumstances of the interpretation of an agreement. In the instant case, the Slovak Republic's own conduct demonstrates that it was perfectly aware and had fully agreed upon the inclusion of the devaluation loans as non-performing receivables into the assets assigned to SI. Indeed, in 1994, three tri-partite set-off agreements were concluded whereby the MF SR paid an obligation it had towards each respective FTO through the set-off of FTO receivables held by SI (after their assignment from CSOB). This operation had the effect of reducing SI\u2019s receivables and entitlement to collect from these FTOs. While this had the advantage for the MF SR and the FTOs of reducing their respective liabilities, it had the collateral effect of reducing SI\u2019s ability to repay CSOB's loan from collections from those FTOs. Such an operation and its implied increase of CSOB's exposure to get SI\u2019s loan repaid could make sense only because of the Slovak Republic's undertaking to provide SI with the funds necessary to meet its loan obligation to CSOB. The Slovak Republic knew, when it accepted the transfer of those receivables to SI, that the Devaluation Agreement was not an appropriate instrument to ensure performance of these receivables and it acted subsequently on the same basis. The Slovak Republic alleges that there had been some indications that through 1994 the Slovak Republic would have repaid some SKK 1.4 billion for these receivables. \u00d1o specific evidence has been submitted in this respect, and the reduction claimed by the Slovak Republic in respect of the principal is below this amount.\n\n184.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not share the Slovak Republic's view that proof should be given that the receivables assigned effective on December 31.1993 were in fact actually non-performing. The content of Article 3(II)(2) CA does not go so far. It requires CSOB and SI to identify the non-performing receivables. If a receivable so selected were later to appear as performing, in full or in part, it would have the effect of increasing SI\u2019s collection and allow the repayment of CSOB's loan. No adverse effect would occur that would put the actual operation of Article 3(II)(2) CA into question. Moreover, the Slovak Republic has no interest in challenging the transfer of receivables because they were performing. As the Slovak Republic had to cover the losses caused by non-performing receivables, the more performing receivables that were transferred, the less substantial its obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses would be.\n\n*2. The receivables concerning Polnopo / Mykoprogres*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nAnother on-balance sheet receivable assigned for an amount of SKK 121,085,371.50 concerned Polnopo. This receivable had been guaranteed by Mykoprogres in an amount of SKK 118,476,874. Mykoprogres became subject of bankruptcy proceedings, initiated by SI. In the course of these proceedings Mykoprogres requested the District Court in Bratislava to declare that SI had no valid claim against Mykoprogres. The Slovak Republic invokes this request to argue that it should not be held to cover losses from the Polnopo receivables as these receivables had not properly been assigned to SI. However, the objection raised by Mykoprogres is not more than an argument of a third party opposing a guarantee payment, that may be based on grounds unrelated to the relationship between the creditor and the debtor of the disputed asset. It does not specifically support a view that no claim of SI exists against its debtor Polnopo. Mykroprogres\u2019 objection has no legal effect on the validity of the transfer of the Polnopo receivable as it was agreed between CSOB and SI and is consequently binding on the Slovak Republic.\n\n186.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic decided on June 26, 1998 to overturn a decision of the Regional Court in Bratislava that failed to examine Mykoprogres\u2019 objection to SI\u2019s claim; the matter was therefore returned to the lower court for further proceedings.91 This Court subsequently reopened the bankruptcy on November 20, 1998, in the course of which the trustee of Mykoprogress challenged SI\u2019s receivable. No evidence has been produced about the outcome of these proceedings. One of the Slovak Republic's legal experts confirms that there is no final decision on the merits and he abstains from offering a conclusion in this respect; he states, however, that the trustee's challenge enables him to assert that the validity of Mykoprogres\u2019 receivable is \"seriously questioned\".92 This expert does not consider, however, nor did the Slovak Republic, that Mykoprogres\u2019 refusal to settle SI\u2019s claim has been examined in detail by an Expert Commission directed by Ms. Papc\u00fanov\u00e1, an executive of SI appointed by the MF SR, at a meeting held on February 13, 1997, that concluded unanimously that no imperfections to the particulars with respect to the assignment of balance sheet receivables from CSOB to SI were discovered.93 As it has been reported to the Tribunal, at no time during its negotiations with SI did Mykoprogres question the validity of its obligations to SI.94\n\nReply Opinion of O.

Kalinov\u00e1, paras. 26-32 and documents referred to.\n\n187.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal does not retain the objection raised by the Slovak Republic in this respect.\n\n*3. Later transfer of receivables*\n----------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nUnder Article 3(II)(2) CA, the receivables to be assigned had to be specified as of December 31, 1993. However, on May 31, 1995, CSOB and SI agreed to transfer receivables to SI that had not been identified on December 31, 1993. Pursuant to Amendment No. 2 to the Assignment Agreement, effective as of June 1, 1995, CSOB assigned to SI a receivable from Omnia for SKK 86,948,277.04. On this basis, Amendment No. 4 to the LA increased the SKK part of the Ioan by the same amount and it modified the amount of the installments correspondingly.\n\n189.\n\nOn August 16, 1994, CSOB and SI agreed in Amendment No. 1 to the Assignment Agreement to retract part of the assignment of receivables related to AVEX and listed in the receivables transferred to SI as of December 31.1993 under the Assignment Agreement. The amount of the assigned receivables was thus reduced by SKK 51,668,195 and became a total of SKK 6,469,439.886.91. With effect on August 1, 1994, the same reduction in SKK was agreed in Amendment No. 2 to the LA, thus reducing the SKK part of the total loan to SKK 5,233,127.586.91 (the other part in Czech Crowns remaining unchanged at 1,055,000.000). The revised payment schedule in Amendment No. 3 of the LA did take account of this reduction. The Slovak Republic's claim for a reduction of approximately SKK 14 million paid as interest on the loan is based on the erroneous assumption that the reduction was effective on December 31, 1993. As stated above, this reduction occurred on August 1, 1994. This claim cannot, therefore, be upheld by the Tribunal.\n\n190.\n\nThe withdrawal of the A VEX receivable, however, did not create new opportunities to change the Slovak Republic\u2019s coverage for losses of assigned receivables. Indeed, the Slovak Republic had only undertaken to cover losses out of the assignment of receivables, as selected on December 31, 1993. Receivables thus selected but no longer assigned to SI, surely reduce the Slovak Republic\u2019s commitment to cover the losses resulting from these receivables. On the other hand, such withdrawal of receivables cannot make room under Article 3 CA to cover receivables not selected as of December 31, 1993, but transferred by an agreement between CSOB and SI after this date.\n\n191.\n\nThe fact that SI\u2019s Supervisory Board has approved the transfer of new receivables to SI does not imply that the Slovak Republic has agreed to extend its obligation to cover these receivables, *i.e.* beyond what was provided in Article 3(II) CA.\n\n192.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that it cannot agree that the receivable from Omnia forms part of the on-balance sheet receivables that can trigger SI\u2019s losses that the Slovak Republic had to cover.\n\nB. Off-Balance Sheet Receivables\n--------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe Future Assignment Agreement (also referred to as the \"FAA\") that became effective on December 31, 1993, identified the off-balance sheet instruments under which CSOB might be obliged to make payments to the payees of such an instrument, whereupon the respective amount would become due and payable by the domestic instructing party (the FTOs) to CSOB. The FAA specified the OBS liabilities that could oblige CSOB to make payments after 1993 because of guarantees and letters of credit granted to third parties. When CSOB had to make such a payment, it assigned the OBS receivable to SI against payment of a consideration in the amount of 100% of the nominal value of such receivable, on the basis of an OBS Assignment Agreement. To finance such assignment, CSOB advanced SI the funds through an OBS Loan Agreement. The receivables exposed to a later assignment have been selected during the negotiations that took place before December 31, 1993 and that involved, *inter alia,* CSOB, SI and representatives of the Slovak Republic, in the same way as this was done in respect of the selection of the on-balance sheet receivables.\n\n194.\n\nThe Future Assignment Agreement set the total amount of STs payment exposure at SKK 4,229,367.000. It identified the FTOs holding such instruments to be assigned to SI as: Technopol, Slovart, Chirana Export-Import, Drevo\u00fania, Istraconti, Martimex, Elteco Zdruzenie.\n\n*1. CSOB \u2019s internal instructions*\n----------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argues that OBS instruments had been created and/or paid by CSOB in breach of its own internal control regulations.\n\n196.\n\nThe issuance of the OBS instruments was governed by CSOB Order No. 7/78.95 This Order required CSOB to follow a specific procedure to issue a guarantee *(e.g.* the use of specific written forms, signatures, specific processing). The Slovak Republic notes that a KPMG audit for 199296 had stated that there were significant differences between the bank\u2019s records and counter party confirmations and that therefore CSOB's procedures had not been applied. The Slovak Republic asserts that of the 420 OBS items assigned by CSOB to SI, 18 OBS files did not have a request by the FTO for the issuance of a guarantee, in 9 files this request had not been signed by the FTO and in 11 files, there was no guarantee agreement signed by CSOB.97\n\nCSOB's Hearing Exh. 7 for I. Cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1 (English translation).\n\nStatement of P. Knapp, Exh. 1.\n\nCf. Rejoinder Opinion of D. Frishberg, Exh. 3-28.\n\n197.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also contends that CSOB Internal Regulation 6/93,98 that applied to the guarantee payment, was not followed either. For instance, the rule that payments could only be made when there was a guarantee agreement, signed by CSOB, was not followed for 17 OBS payments. Contrary to the instructions, 42 OBS files did not contain a request for payment from the FTO, 52 files had no payment order, 297 files had incomplete payment orders, 119 files did not mention the third party beneficiary, 32 files had no proof of a non-payment guarantee and 13 files lacked an original copy of the non-payment guarantee.\n\nStatement of I. Cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1 in Reply, Exh. 1.\n\n198.\n\nThe Slovak Republic further notes that these deficiencies could overlap, as some OBS files breached several rules. In 352 of the 420 OBS transactions, the CSOB\u2019s procedures on issuing and paying thus appear not been followed on one or more points. For that reason, in the Slovak Republic\u2019s view, SI should not have been bound to these irregular receivables, and CSOB\u2019s claim against the Slovak Republic for covering the losses resuiting from assigned OBS receivables should be reduced by SKK 10,371,262.716 (including interest).\n\n199.\n\nCSOB objects to the Slovak Republic's allegations that they are not correct and anyhow not relevant in respect of the validity of the assignments to SI and the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation. CSOB affirms that the Slovak Republic did not produce any evidence in support of its objection that payments were made that had not to be made or that other payments were made to the wrong entity. Despite the accumulation of alleged documentary failures, wholly rejected by CSOB, the Slovak Republic and its accounting expert failed, in CSOB's view, to identify even a single disbursement error.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the deficiencies alleged by the Slovak Republic are of a purely technical nature and relate to CSOB's internal method of processing this line of business. Under testimony, the Slovak Republic's accounting expert had to accept that a number of what he identified as deficiencies did in fact not reveal any irregularity. He also admitted that much less is required by way of documentary proof when CSOB had to honor abstract guarantees, as most of the guarantees were in fact.\"99 It was also established that issues raised by KPMG were not raised again after the 1992 report, and in particular in 1993 and the years when the OBS items reached maturity.100 The Slovak Republic's argumentation was directed to raise doubts about the quality of CSOB's method of handling the guarantees underlying the OBS items. The Tribunal finds that this matter is anyhow not relevant and that the objections raised by the Slovak Republic did not demonstrate that payments were made to creditors to which the CSOB should not have paid. It also observes that the Slovak Republic did not raise similar objections to the processing of guarantees before December 1993 and related to the on-balance sheet instruments.\n\nTR, April 17, 2003, 53:23 - 60:8 (Frishberg).\n\nStatement of P. Knapp, Exh. 2; TR, April 14, 2003, 155:11-157:18 (Hart); TR, April 15, 2003, 103:19104:15 (Knapp).\n\n201.\n\nThe Slovak Republic did not challenge CSOB's assertion that none of the beneficiaries of the underlying guarantees that it alleged to be inherently irregular objected to CSOB's conduct. The Slovak Republic did not consider either the fact that none of the FTOs has ever filed a claim or otherwise complained that CSOB had not properly handled payments under the guarantees and that CSOB thus had not received title to claim the respective amounts from the FTOs.\n\n202.\n\nUnder the OBS Assignment Agreements, SI was entitled to claim the delivery of the complete documentation concerning the FTO and the assigned receivables (Art. VIII). On March 1, 1996, SI and CSOB concluded the Agreement on a Repayment Schedule Mechanism for OBS Instruments and the Method of Source Document Delivery. Under this agreement CSOB committed itself to deliver to SI all documents evidencing and documenting the amounts of the assigned OBS, as from January 1, 1994. On March 31, 1994, CSOB transmitted a complete documentation on the transfer of the OBS items to the MF SR.101 The Slovak Republic has not reported that SI had indicated that it had not received these documents or had objected to the assignment of OBS receivables on the ground that they had not been sufficiently documented.\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 5.\n\n203.\n\nIn late 1996, the Slovak Republic made a declaration that CSOB was not providing documentation to prove the amounts owed to it.102 A request of SI for documentation was addressed to CSOB on December 10, 1996.103 The expert commission, mentioned above, headed by a representative of the MF SR, unanimously confirmed on February 13, 1997 that \"no imperfections to the particulars with respect to the assignment of offbalance sheet and on-balance sheet receivables from CSOB to SI were discovered\".104 When the MF SR was invited, in a letter of May 30, 1997, to send documentation on its objection in respect of the transfer of certain receivables, that it had promised to submit in a meeting held on May 16, 1999, no further reaction occurred.105\n\nLetter of the MF SR of November 8, 1996, Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 26; Bond prospectus issued on December 16.1996, CSOB's Memorial, Exh. 8.\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 32.\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 34.\n\nStatement of P. Knapp, No. 22 and Exh. 3 and 4.\n\n204.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that SI had every opportunity to inquire into the status of each of the receivables before accepting its assignment. In this respect, it was irrelevant whether all the internal procedural rules had been followed when these receivables had been created. As they existed, they were on CSOB\u2019s books. As for CSOB\u2019s payment of the OBS receivables after 1993, SI could at any time have challenged these payments if they were not due, but it did not do so. On the contrary, without any objection it accepted their assignment after CSOB\u2019s payment. The relevant OBS instruments have been listed in the Future Assignment Agreement, in the subsequent OBS Assignment Agreements and again in the numerous Amendments to the OBS Loan Agreement. The Slovak Republic acknowledged the OBS receivables when Mr. Magu\u00eda initialed the FAA. By entering into these transactions, SI accepted and confirmed that CSOB had acquired valid title to the respective receivables and that they were thus validly transferred to SI. This is all that matters under Article 3(II)(2) CA. The Slovak Republic is indeed bound by the transfer of assets as they were negotiated, specified and agreed upon between CSOB and SI. The legal effect of these agreements upon the Slovak Republic, which is an essential element of the operation of Article 3(II) CA, is explained by the fact that the Slovak Republic, as having complete control over SI, had full opportunity to object to the transfer of any particular OBS item to SI or to request any further information it might have thought to be relevant. The Slovak Republic has not done so and cannot do so years later in the course of these proceedings. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the Slovak Republic's objections in this respect..\n\n*2. Absence of signature on OBS Technopol loans*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has argued that the SI is not bound by the Amendments No. 37 through 42 and Amendment No. 46 to the Technopol OBS Loan Agreement No. 01/02/95 because these Amendments have not been signed by SI. Nor is it bound by Amendments No 43, 44, 45, 47, and 48 of said Agreement, as these Amendments were not signed by any of the parties.\n\n206.\n\nThe Slovak Republic notes correctly that the Technopol OBS Loan Agreement No 01/02/95 is governed by Slovak law. It is governed by the same law as the Loan Agreement of May 25, 1994 (LA), that contains a choice of law clause in favour of Slovak law and of which it is an integral part. Under Section 40(3) of the Slovak Civil Code a written agreement or written amendment to an agreement is only binding when it has been executed by the parties thereto.\n\n207.\n\nAs the requirement of both parties\u2019 signature has not been met in respect of Technopol OBS Loan Amendments No 37 through 48, the Slovak Republic contends that SI is not bound by these Amendments. Therefore, CSOB's damage claim against the Slovak Republic, as calculated as of December 31, 2002, must be reduced by SKK 683,553,309 (including interest).\n\n208.\n\nCSOB has argued that the Amendments No 37 through 48, created from October 1996 till December 1997, had not been signed because SI\u2019s Board of Supervisors no longer convened and refused to supervise SI\u2019s activities.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this respect that such refusal of SI\u2019s Board to operate may be a breach of the duty to co-operate and to implement the Agreements concluded between CSOB and SI. It does not compensate for the missing signatures.\n\n210.\n\nUnder Section III of the Technopol OBS Assignment Agreement No. 01/1/1995, CSOB assigned all Technopol OBS receivables to SI, including those due in the future. Section IV stipulated that for each assigned receivable, upon provision of payment in favor of the beneficiary under an OBS instrument, SI shall pay consideration to CSOB in the amount of 100% of the nominal value of the receivable. Concurrently with each such payment, in accordance with Section 1(b) LA -\n\n... the Assignor [CSOB] shall provide the Assignee [SI] with a loan for such reaccounted payment in the corresponding amount pursuant to a separate loan agreement (\"partial disbursement of the loan by the Assignee\").\n\nIn the second part of the same Section IV, it was stated that the same procedure \"shall be applied for each partial monetary payment in favor of a beneficiary under a specific off-balance sheet instrument\". Similarly, Article 2 LA provided that the OBS loans \"shall be drawn as the need arises\".\n\n211.\n\nUnder the Teehnopol OBS Loan Agreement No. 01/02/95, concluded the same day as the respective assignment agreement, it was stated that the loan shall be disbursed gradually in accordance with the payments of OBS receivables from Technopol (Section II/1) and it was specified that -\n\nEach individual (partial) disbursement of the loan shall be regulated by the amendments thereto.\n\n212.\n\nIt follows from these undertakings that upon payment of the beneficiary of a guarantee, SI had to pay the full nominal value of the respective Technopol receivable and was provided by CSOB, for this purpose, with a loan in the same amount. CSOB's obligation to provide for such a loan and SI\u2019s acceptance were agreed upon in the Technopol OBS Loan Agreement. However, the individual provision of a loan for each particular receivable reaching maturity required a procedure to be applied for each partial payment (Section IV of the Technopol OBS Assignment Agreement). In addition, the loan had to be disbursed on the basis of a specific amendment to the Technopol OBS Loan Agreement, the latter thus operating as a kind of umbrella instrument.\n\n213.\n\nThe legal framework agreed upon by CSOB and SI required therefore the execution of a specific agreement, *i.e.* an amendment. This is confirmed by the actual practice followed in the relations between CSOB and SI as demonstrated by the Technopol Amendments No. 1-36 that are all signed by both parties. The Amendments No. 37-48 that have not been signed by SI all contain the following sentence -\n\nBy signing this Amendment, the Client accepts such loan.\n\nIt is thus demonstrated that for CSOB as well, SI\u2019s signature was considered as a legal requirement for the existence and disbursement of each partial loan.\n\n214.\n\nCSOB's position in these proceedings is not consistent with the Application for registration in SI\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings it filed on June 23, 1998 with the Regional Court in Bratislava.106 In respect of the list of outstanding loans related to Technopol OBS instruments, this Application does not refer to any Technopol OBS Loan Amendment above No. 36. The Application states in a separate section V that under the Technopol OBS Assignment Agreement, SI was to pay CSOB consideration in the amount of 100% of the nominal value of the receivables assigned, and that SI violated this Agreement in October 1996 when it refused to conclude amendments to the loan agreement, thus not paying the consideration for the receivables assigned. Consequently, CSOB registered a receivable \"ensuing from the failure to pay the consideration for assignment\", and it offered as documentary evidence, *inter alia,* \"draft Amendments No. 37 through to 48 to the Loan Agreement No. 01/02/95, including the related correspondence\". In the Section VI below, this receivable was identified as \"Receivable by virtue of the unpaid purchase price\" (No. 9). It was thus stated and confirmed by CSOB that the loans based on these amendments, that were not signed on behalf SI, never came into existence. Similarly, CSOB's acceleration letter of April 10, 1997 that listed all relevant contractual documents, does not refer to the Technopol OBS loan amendments above No. 36.\n\nStatement I. Cestr, Tab C, filed with CSOB's Request for Provisional Measures of September 4, 1998; the Slovak Republic's Observations on CSOB's Request for Provisional Measures of January 19, 2000, Exh. B; the Slovak Republic's Hearing Exhibits, November 2002, Tab 9.\n\n215.\n\nArticle 3(II)(3) CA provided for full payment (as \"consideration\") of 100% of the nominal value of the assigned receivable. As has been explained above, such payment was financed by the provision of a loan, that was designed to have SI making a loss that the Slovak Republic undertook to cover. The Slovak Republic's obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses required the conclusion of a loan agreement between CSOB and SI, creating an obligation for SI to repay the loan that triggered its losses and consequently the Slovak Republic's obligation for compensation. The existence of a loan agreement was therefore a requirement, a *conditio sine qua non* of the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation. This requirement has not been met in respect of Amendments No. 37-48 to the Technopol OBS Loan Agreement. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects CSOB's claim in this respect.\n\n*3. Later transfer of receivables*\n----------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nIn relation to the late transfer of the Omnia receivables, referred to above, CSOB explained that this transfer was also to be adjusted, in addition to the credit given for the AVEX receivable, in taking into consideration the partial assignment of the receivable for Intercoop that was agreed between CSOB and SI on April 21, 1995, in an amount of SKK 31,661,730.53. This transfer was also balanced by the assignment back to CSOB of the OBS receivable Drevo\u00faina for SKK 43,661,000. This last assignment has not been documented before this Tribunal otherwise than through the Minutes of the SI Supervisory Board held on August 31.1994,107 where it was agreed to accept CSOB's proposal to exchange the Drevo\u00fania receivable for the Intercoop OBS receivable which did result in the transfer of the entire Intercoop debt exposure to SI.\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 8\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that these transfers were made in a way to keep an overall balance of the amount of receivables transferred to SI and resulted in a decrease of this amount of about SKK 14 million to the benefit of SI. These operations are not, as contended by the Slovak Republic, evidence of CSOB's failure to manage SI, all the more so as SI was governed by its Supervisory Board, composed by representatives of the Slovak Republic. However, the receivables newly added to SI after December 31, 1993 did not comply with Article 3(II)(2) CA that fixed the receivables to be identified at that time-limit, not providing for any later exchange. The losses to be covered by the Slovak Republic had to be caused by receivables assigned to SI in compliance with all provisions of Article 3 CA, including the requirement that they had to be identified on December 31.1993 at the latest. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that it cannot consider the above mentioned receivable from Intercoop aS part of the OBS-assets that can trigger SI\u2019s losses that the Slovak Republic had to cover.\n\n218.\n\nThe Slovak Republic contended, moreover, in its Third Post-Hearing Memorial submitted on July 18, 2003, that it had identified five payments made under three separate guarantees (two relating to Martimex and one to Technopol) which were not included in Schedule A of the OBS Future Assignment Agreement, but were nevertheless assigned to SI. The Tribunal observes, however, that this Memorial was submitted on the condition, expressed by the Chairman, that it shall \"only address issues raised in the posthearing brief of the other side\"; thus, \"no new elements\" were admitted.108 The argument made by the Slovak Republic in its last brief in respect of these guarantees was new. Therefore, it cannot be decided by the Tribunal.\n\nTR, April 18, 2003, 231:5-10 (Chairman).\n\n**VI. CSOB\u2019s** Claim For Compensation\n-------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nCSOB claims full compensation for the damages it suffered because of the Slovak Republic\u2019s breach of its cover losses obligation under Article 3(II)(5) of the CA. CSOB's alleged damage is composed of various elements related to the structure of SI\u2019s payment obligation and loss, and to the consequences of the Slovak Republic's failure to pay on CSOB.\n\nA. Obligation to Pay Full Compensation\n--------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nUnder Section 373 of the Czech Commercial Code, the obligation to compensate for damages is determined as follows -\n\nWho ever breaches a duty arising from a contractual relationship is obliged to provide compensation for the damage caused to the other party, unless he proves that such a breach was caused by circumstances excluding his liability.\n\n221.\n\nIn the instant case, no other compensation than through payment of money is to be considered (Section 378 Commercial Code).\n\n222.\n\nSection 379 Commercial Code states that unless provided otherwise, compensation consists of \"actual damage\" and \"lost profit\". Damage also includes any expenses which the injured party has incurred by having to expend funds due to the breach of obligation of the other party (Section 380 Commercial Code).\n\n223.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Slovak Republic did not provide SI with funds necessary to allow SI to repay CSOB's loan nor did the Slovak Republic in any other way, *i.e.* by direct payments to CSOB, reduce SI\u2019s payment obligation towards CSOB and thus SI\u2019s loss. As CSOB was not paid according to the CSOB/SI Agreements, it suffered damage caused by the Slovak Republic's failure to cover losses in a way that allowed the repayment of the loan. SI\u2019s default on its loan from CSOB and CSOB's damage arising from this default was thus caused by the Slovak Republic's breach of its cover losses obligation. The Tribunal has now to determine the amount of CSOB's prejudice arising from SI\u2019s default that can be attributed to the Slovak Republic's default on its cover losses obligation under Article 3(II)(5) CA.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation and its duty to provide compensation for CSOB's damage is based on and limited by the relevant provisions of Article 3(II) CA.109 The Slovak Republic had to \"cover\", respectively to \"compensate\" SI\u2019s losses (Art. 3(II)(5) CA), such losses being identified as resulting -\n\n... from the operating costs and the schedule of payments for the receivables assigned by CSOB to the Collection Companies, including payments of interest.\n\nAs this has been explained above, the payments hereby referred to relate to the loan that CSOB was required to provide \"up to the sum of considerations for the receivables assigned to the Collection Companies\" (Art. 3(II)(3) CA). To the extent that SI was not in a position to repay this loan and therefore made a loss, the Slovak Republic was required to compensate for such loss in the same amount as determined by paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 3(II) CA.\n\nCSOB has repeatedly argued that its claim was exclusively based on the CA, cf., *inter alia,* CSOB's Reply, p. 30. This has to be held against CSOB's pleadings at the April 2003 hearing where it was contended that CSOB's actual damage resulting from the Slovak Republic's breach of its obligation to cover losses as required under the CA was necessarily [sic] what SI was bound to pay pursuant to the LA (TR, April 18, 2003, 61:13-20, 63:1-8), while it was also argued that CSOB was in no way seeking to enforce the LA itself (TR, April 18, 2003, 62:23-25). CSOB then stated that its claim for actual damage is \"for the value of the Loan Agreement\" (CSOB Post Hearing Submission on issues addressed at the hearing of April 2003, No. 34) and that \"it seeks compensation based upon a factual finding as to the value of its rights under the SI Loan Agreement\" (CSOB's Reply to the Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial, No. 10).\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Parties\u2019 view that as a matter of principle, the burden of proof for CSOB's damage is on CSOB. The Slovak Republic further argues that the applicable standard of proof is determined by Czech law, as the law chosen in Article 7(4) CA. CSOB, on the other hand, is of the view that under Czech law, the burden of proof relates to procedure as opposed to substance, and that the CA's choice of law clause does not extend to matters of procedure; therefore, the only rule to be applied by this Tribunal would be ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) which states -\n\nThe Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value.\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that while Arbitration Rule 34(1) must prevail, it has not to open a discussion on an issue whether this Rule leaves room for the application of Czech law in respect of the assessment of evidence, respectively the required standard of proof. Section 132 of the Czech Procedural Code states that the court assesses the evidence at its own discretion. There does therefore not exist any discrepancy in comparison with Arbitration Rule 34(1). However, it has been argued by the Slovak Republic that in some respects, *i.e.* on the matter of lost profits, Czech law requires specifically high probability in assessing evidence. This may be related to the law applicable to the merits and will be dealt with at the appropriate place.\n\n227.\n\nAfter SI\u2019s failure to meet its payment obligations that had been deferred to that date, the situation deteriorated and lead CSOB to formally request from SI, in a letter dated August 22, 1996, payment of the then outstanding amounts.110 This letter was followed by another letter, dated September 5, 1996 and addressed to the MF SR, requiring payment of the amount of which SI was in default.111 As no further progress was made, in the relation with SI as well as in the course of the exchange of views that took place between CSOB and the MF SR, CSOB, by a letter of April 10, 1997 to SI declared the entirety of the outstanding principal and interest due and payable as of that date, with reference to Article 11(a) LA.112 In another letter of the same day, CSOB requested the MF SR, with reference to Article 3 CA, to fulfill immediately its duty to cover the losses of SI and to secure the payment of the due receivables of CSOB from SI in the amount of SKK 13,710,273.571.88. CSOB further declared that in the event no payment was received by April 17, 1997, it would undertake the necessary steps for collection of the MF SR's obligation and compensation for damages.113\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 20.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 21.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 35.\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 36; Opinion of O. Oveckov\u00e1, Exh. 11.\n\n228.\n\nIn the light of these developments, SI became liable for payment, as from April 10, 1997, for the full amount of the loan. Indeed, pursuant to Article 11(a) LA, and given SI\u2019s default, CSOB was entitled to declare the full amount of the loan immediately due and payable. The CA does not require CSOB to exhaust any method of recoverability from SI, including the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings against SI. As SI had no funds available to repay even part of its loan, it made a loss corresponding to the amounts outstanding on April 10, 1997. As SI did not pay within a week as required by CSOB, the latter confirmed by its letter of April 18, 1997 that all its receivables from SI were mature and payable, pursuant to Article 11(a) LA, as from April 10, 1997. The same letter stated that the total amount of the due receivables was SKK 13,710,273.571.88 and that this figure did take account of a set-off CSOB operated with funds maintained by SI on its sub-accounts and its current account in the total amount of SKK 2,792,822.85. It was further indicated that the global amount included SKK 1,500,000 for unpaid fees under the Operation Agreement, with the effect that the receivable relevant under the loan was of SKK 13,708,773.551.88 (principal and interest).\n\n229.\n\nThe Slovak Republic's obligation was to cover SI\u2019s losses in the amount specified, in compliance with Article 3(II) CA, in the LA and its collateral agreements. Therefore, when the full amount of the Ioan was called on April 10, 1997, the Slovak Republic had to perform its cover losses obligation in respect of the total amount of the loan on the same day. As from that day, the Slovak Republic, failing to perform its obligation, was in delay according to Sections 365 and 367 Commercial Code, thus creating CSOB's title to claim damages under Section 373 of this Code.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal will successively analyze the different claims for actual damages that CSOB has based upon the Slovak Republic\u2019s failure to cover the losses SI has sustained in respect of the loan extended by CSOB. After this examination of CSOB's claim for actual damage, it will focus on CSOB\u2019s claim for lost profits.\n\nB. The Claim Based on the Principal Amount of the Loan\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nFor CSOB, the advances under the Loan Agreement for On-balance sheet receivables were SKK 6,556,388.163.95.114 This amount does not include the portion of the AVEX receivable that had been retransferred in 1994 to CSOB in the amount of SKK 51,668,195.00. It does include the Omnia receivable of SKK 86,948,277.04.\n\nCf., *inter alia,* CSOB's Memorial, Tab B, No. 7.\n\n232.\n\nThe total exposure in respect of the seven OBS Assignment Agreements was SKK 4,217,744.329.42.115 The actual total amount of the exposure, *i.e.* the loan disbursements made effectively is SKK 4,090,848.277.35.116 The retracted Drevo\u00fania receivable of SKK 43,661.00 is not included in this amount.\n\nCf, Expert Report of T.H. Hart, No. 16, table 3.\n\nCSOB's Memorial, Tab B, No. 11.51 ; Statement of J. St\u00ebrbov\u00e0, No. 11, p. 6; Expert Opinion of T.H. Hart, No. 16, table 3.\n\n233.\n\nOn this basis, for CSOB, the total principal amount of the loan is SKK 10,647,236.441.30.\n\n234.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's decision relating to the receivables that cannot be taken into account as triggering SI\u2019s losses to be covered by the Slovak Republic under Article 3(II) CA, the above mentioned amounts have to be adjusted. First, extracting the Omnia receivable, the on-balance sheet portion of the loan amounts to SKK 6,469,439.886.91. Second, the Technopol Loan Amendments No. 37 through 48, in the cumulated amount of SKK 258,272,280, and the Intercoop exposure of SKK 31,661,730.53 have to be deducted (both amounts together: SKK 289,934,010.53) from the OBS portion of the loan, that becomes then a total of SKK 3,800,914.266.82. In the light of these figures, the total principal amount of the loan becomes SKK 10,270,354.154.\n\n235.\n\nThe reductions made above from the total amount claimed by CSOB are in an amount of SKK 376,882,288. As indicated earlier, the question has now to be raised whether this amount can compensate for the overturn by 0.24% of the capital adequacy ratio. As CSOB accepts that a capital adequacy ratio of 6.49% was actually hit at December 31, 1993, when the principal amount of the loan for on-balance and off-balance receivables was, in CSOB's view, reaching an exposure of SKK 10,750,475.082,\u2019117 it follows that a reduction for 0.24% is in an amount of SKK 397,552,237. This leads to a result of SKK 10,352,922.845 as the amount corresponding to a capital adequacy ratio of 6.25% at December 31.1993. Therefore, as the capital adequacy reduction leads to a commitment of an amount higher than the amount of SKK 10,270,354.154, reached as the actual amount of receivables to be covered under the provisions of Article 3(II)(2) CA, it is this lower amount that is to be considered by the Tribunal.\n\nThis figure refers to the on-balance sheet portion (SKK 6,521,108.081.91) and the off-balance sheet portion (SKK 4,229,367.000) as they were agreed upon on December 31, 1993. It does not include the Omnia and Intercoop receivables that are included in CSOB's claim but were admittedly transferred after December 31, 1993. On the other hand, for the purpose of this calculation, the Avex receivable of SKK 51,668,195, and the Drevo\u00fania receivable of SKK 43,661,000, that were transferred at the relevant date, are to be included.\n\n236.\n\nSI\u2019s obligation to repay the loan was admittedly decreasing to the extent SI was able to collect money from the debtors of the poorly performing or non-performing receivables. The payments made on SI\u2019s sub-accounts for the FTOs were later used to repay the loan.118 CSOB's accounting expert presented in his first report a figure of SKK 1,768,360,036,119 whereas another source mentioned an amount of \"over SKK 1.7 billion\".120 In the letter dated April 18, 1997, whereby CSOB confirms to SI the precise amount of the full amount of the due receivables under the loan, it is stated that a total of SKK 2,792,822.85 \"were used to set off a part of CSOB's due receivable from SI\". This confirms CSOB's practice, agreed upon by SI, to use the balance of the subaccounts where payments from the FTOs were collected for the repayment of the loan.121 Taking into account collections made on April 10, 1997, CSOB's accounting expert indicated in his reply a total amount of SKK 1,770,462.989.122 He also reported in respect of these FTO payments that an amount of SKK 1,592,059.556 was collected until April 10, 1997, and another amount of SKK 187,889,159 after that date,123 resulting in repayments on the loan of SKK 1,584,073.830 before and on April 10, 1997, and of SKK 186,389,159 after that date.124 CSOB's claim for the total principal amount does not include such repayments, while other statements made on behalf of CSOB do. Where no reduction was made to take account of SI\u2019s repayments funded by the collections from the FTOs, this has to be done by the Tribunal, where relevant.125 However, the Tribunal cannot take account of later collections that may have been made by SI\u2019s bankruptcy trustee, leading to a positive balance in SI\u2019s account with CSOB, as the allegation made by the Slovak Republic in this respect was contained in its Third Post Hearing Memorial and therefore submitted too late to be considered by this Tribunal. Further, The Slovak's Republic's allegation that repayments funded by collections made by the bankruptcy trustee have been effectively been made to CSOB is not supported by evidence.\n\nAfter FTOs made deposits on their sub-accounts, SI directed CSOB to transfer the balance from the subaccounts to STs main current account that served the repayment of the loan. The payments on the subaccounts with CSOB was secured by Agreement No. 001/1996 on the Creation of Pledge over Receivables. Cf. Statement J. St\u00ebrbov\u00e0, No. 13/14. A small part of the money collected from the FTOs was used to pay CSOB's bank and management fees.\n\nExpert Report of T.H. Hart, No. 46, Table 7.\n\nStatement of J. Sterbov\u00e1, No. 21. CSOB's Reply to the Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial, No. 161: \"approximately 1.7 billion\".\n\nIn reply to a question from the Tribunal, CSOB indicated that the letter sent on September 5, 1996 from CSOB to the Slovak Republic, requesting payment of the outstanding loan, referred to an amount established after CSOB had reconciled the balances of all of the SI accounts into the main SI current account (CSOB Post-hearing Submission on issues addressed at the hearing of November, 2002, Tab A, p. 16).\n\nExpert Reply of T.H. Hart, Exh. 39.\n\nThis amount includes a remaining balance as of May 6, 1998 on SI\u2019s account in the amount of SKK 28,901.19 (Expert Report of T.H. Hart, Exh. 4) that was later corrected into SKK 68,169.95 (Expert Reply of T.H. Hart, Exh. 39).\n\nExpert Reply of T.H. Hart, Exh. 39. See also part of the correspondence in Statement of J. St\u00ebrbov\u00e0, Exh. 25.8,9.\n\nPart of the collection from the FTO may relate to the Omnia and/or Intercoop assets that are to be excluded from the principal amount of the loan. However, the Tribunal's file does not allow to trace such a relation.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal determines therefore that the amount of SKK 8,686,280.324 is the principal amount of the loan as of April 10, 1997. Repayments made after this date in the amount of SKK 186,389,159 will also have to be further considered.\n\nC. The Claim Based on Interest Related to the Loan\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nPursuant to Article 3 (II)(4) CA, the Slovak Republic\u2019s cover losses obligation included \"payments of interests\". The interest related to the repayment of the loan constituted, together with the schedule of payments and the operation costs, the \"losses\" that the Collection Companies would make and that would have to be covered by the Slovak Republic, whenever necessary.\n\n*1. Article 4 of the Loan Agreement*\n------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Loan Agreement sets out in Article 4(II) the following provisions for the fixing of interest rates and the method for their calculation -\n\nThe loan shall bear interest at an annual interest rate. The interest shall be payable, along with the installment of the principal of the loan, always at the end of each calendar quarter commencing on March 31, 1995. The interest rate shall be determined as a floating rate to be fixed at regular three-month intervals for the subsequent period. The first interest rate shall be fixed at the time of loan drawdown, the second fixation shall be made as of March 31, 1994 and, thereafter, the interest shall be fixed at regular three-month intervals, as mentioned above.\n\nThe interest rate shall be determined by using one of the following methods or a combination thereof. Such interest rate shall be increased by a uniform surcharge to cover the Bank\u2019s overhead costs at a rate of 3/4 (three-quarters) % per annum.\n\na. The loan made hereunder shall be refinanced for each subsequent three-month period (until the next interest rate fixation) on the interbank market. The interest rate shall be determined at the rate \u2018sale\u2019 indicated in the table InterestRate Fixing in the Market of Interbank Deposits for a Three-Month Period as published in HOSPODARSKE NOVINY two business days prior to the fixation date. In the event that such rate is not quoted in the future or the quotation is not adequate, a similar interest rate shall be used.\n\nb. If there is not sufficient liquidity in the inter-bank market to allow the refinancing of the Bank to the required extent, the interest rate shall be calculated as the average price of the Bank\u2019s resources with a residual maturity of more than two years.\n\nc. If the interest rate as calculated by the methods referred in Section 4a or 4b is not sufficient to cover the cost of the Bank\u2019s refinancing, the interest shall be determined so as to reflect the price of the specific resources used by the Bank to refinance the loan.\n\nParagraph 1 of this provision was modified on April 18, 1996 in Amendment No. 7 in order to take account of situations when the relevant calendar day was a non-banking day.\n\n240.\n\nIn the first of many objections raised in relation to Article 4 LA, the Slovak Republic contends that this provision is too imprecise and unclear to be binding under Slovak law, the law that governs the Loan Agreement. The Slovak Republic\u2019s legal expert on Slovak law was not so outspoken; he concluded that the terms of Article 4 were \"not unambiguous\".126 He admitted that the interpretation given by the Slovak Republic's accounting expert \"is consistent with the wording of Section 4 of the Loan Agreement\".127 This demonstrates that in this legal expert's view, Article 4 LA can be given a meaning and is thus precise enough to be valid.\n\nRejoinder Opinion J. Drgonec, No. 39.\n\nRejoinder Opinion J. Drgonec, No. 40-42.\n\n241.\n\nCSOB\u2019s accounting expert admitted that the implementation of Article 4 LA could be different according to the person who had to fix the actual interest.128 CSOB stated, however, that between CSOB, SI and the MF SR, the meaning of this provision was very well understood and that the methods to determine the interest rates had been agreed upon when the CA was concluded. That is confirmed by the parties\u2019 behavior at the time the provision had to be implemented and the interest rates had to be fixed. Moreover, so CSOB argues, SI and thus also the Slovak Republic would not have been in a better position if ever Article 4 would have been of no use to determine the interest rate. Indeed, under the Slovak Commercial Code, Section 502, SI would then have been obliged to pay interest at the market rates, that would have been higher than the interest provided for under Article 4.\n\nTR, April 14.2003,201:12-203:1 (Hart).\n\n242.\n\nFor the Tribunal, Article 4 LA gave a choice of methods to determine interest rates that were to be applied depending on the circumstances and by the competent representatives of both parties. It follows from the purpose and the object of the LA, and also from the CA with which the LA was closely connected, that CSOB should not make losses on the loans granted to SI. The interest on the loan had to be set accordingly. Article 4, and especially method (c), contained the mechanism to ensure that the loan granted by CSOB was not at a loss but yielded sufficient interest to make it cost-neutral. This goal was clearly stated and the method to achieve it a matter for specialists to decide. The parties\u2019 conduct in the practical application demonstrates that, albeit with or after some debate on particular items, the provision of Article 4 LA was clear enough to be handled by those involved in matters of financing on the side of CSOB as well as for SI.\n\n*2. Methods (a) and (b)*\n------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also argued that even if Article 4 LA were valid, CSOB did not apply this provision correctly as it made use of method (c) only. For the Slovak Republic, methods (a) and (b) were available and had to be applied.\n\n244.\n\nMethod (a) envisaged that the loan would be refinanced on the inter-bank market so that the interest rate had to be determined \"on the basis of the three-month inter-bank rate\". Method (a) that established the most advantageous interest rate for SI, had to be followed whenever the inter-bank market was sufficiently liquid \"to allow the loan\u2019s refinancing\". The three-month BRIBOR rates, to which method (a) referred, were publicly available as of June 23, 1994. Even if they were not quoted, a similar interest rate could be used under method (a). For the Slovak Republic, the Slovakian inter-bank market had generally known an excess of liquidity from 1994 to 2000.129 For the first and second quarters of 1994, during which only a one-month BRIBOR was quoted, the interest rate could be determined on the basis of the \"similar rate\" provision of Article 4(II)(a) LA. According to the Slovak Republic, nowhere does Article 4(II)(a) LA require that the Slovak inter-bank market is stable; stability of the interest rate is not a criterion for using method (a), the application of which only depends on sufficient liquidity. For the Slovak Republic, the evidence presented at the April hearing demonstrated that the Slovak inter-bank market was sufficiently liquid through most of the relevant period. Therefore, method (a) should have been applied in all but four quarters *{i.e.* Q 3/97, Q 4/97, Q1/98, Q 2/98) during the life of the loan. During those four quarters, CSOB should have used method (b) to calculate the interest rate on the SI loan.\n\nCf. Reply Statement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, Exh. 14.\n\n245.\n\nFor CSOB, method (a) was unavailable due to the \"repeated illiquidity and instability of the money market in the Slovak Republic over the relevant period\".130 The three-month BRIBOR interest rates were hypothetical as they were extrapolated. They were never actually available. There was insufficient liquidity in the inter-bank market to enable CSOB to finance the SI loan balance. When the Slovak Republic asserted that there was sufficient liquidity in the market, it referred to volumes of trade with the same loan being bought and sold repeatedly over short periods of time and with none of the funds trading for 3 months terms, but most often relating to overnight or one day deposits. According to CSOB, the evidence offered by the record that CSOB was never in a position to purchase enough 3 months deposits on the inter-bank market to fund the SI loan stands unrebutted, particularly in view of the fact that the SI loan balance continued to increase rather than decrease over time.131\n\nStatement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 10.\n\nStatement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 6-15; Reply Statement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 6-20.\n\n246.\n\nDuring the four quarters that method (a) could not be used, for the Slovak Republic, method (b) should have been followed, *i.e.* the interest rate should be calculated as \"the average price of the bank\u2019s resources with the residual maturity of more than two years.\" CSOB has argued that it never had resources with a residual maturity of more than two years in an amount sufficient to fund the SI loan and thus the conditions were never met to apply method (b). For the Slovak Republic, however, method (b) did not require that these resources amount to a certain percentage of the loan; method (b) could be used for a small portion of the financing.\n\n247.\n\nThe Slovak Republic\u2019s accounting expert has demonstrated what interest would have been due under method (a), starting in June 1994, for all but four quarters during which method (b) should have been used.132 For the Slovak Republic, his analysis shows that it would have been appropriate to follow methods (a) and (b). Because methods (a) and (b) would have yielded substantially smaller amounts of interest, CSOB\u2019s damage claim must be reduced by SKK 1,989,641.433. However, this calculation purports to demonstrate what CSOB should have done and not what CSOB and SI actually did in respect of interest rates fixed in the years 1994 to 1997.\n\nRejoinder D. Frishberg, No. 105-118.\n\n*3. Method (c)*\n---------------\n\n248.\n\nCSOB has followed method (c), *i.e.* based upon the costs of refinancing, to calculate the interest due. For each quarter the interest was calculated on the basis of the costs of the funds used by CSOB to cover the amounts outstanding.133 Whenever there was no sufficient liquidity in the inter-bank market (method a) and CSOB did not have sufficient resources with a residual maturity of more than two years (method b), the actual costs of refinancing was higher than the interest provided for by methods (a) and (b). In that event, method (c) became relevant, *i.e.* the interest rate were to reflect \"the price of the specific resources\" CSOB actually used to refinance the loan. Method (c) encompassed methods (a) and (b). Interest due on loans taken in the BRIBOR inter-bank market (method a) and the costs of financing with CSOB resources with a residual maturity of over two years (method b) were part of the price of \"specific\" resources actually used. In this way, the interest rate was determined by a \"combination\" of the three different methods, as Article 4(2) LA itself provides for.\n\nCf. Statement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 6-14; Reply Statement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 3-20.\n\n249.\n\nThe Slovak Republic argues in this respect that - even when CSOB was entitled to follow method (c) \u2014 that it did not apply this method correctly. Indeed, although CSOB argues that it calculated the interest on the basis of the actual costs of financing the loan, there was a substantial gap between the specific resources identified by CSOB to that end, and the loan balance.134 In order to carry out the method (c) calculation, CSOB had to first quantify the balance of the SI loan for each quarter, and then to identify the specific resources to be used to match the loan volume. CSOB has not proven that the interest were related to the costs of using the \"specific resources used by the bank to refinance the Ioan\", as required by method (c). According to the Slovak Republic, the evidence in the record shows that the method used by CSOB consistently failed to match specific resources to the balance of the SI loan. It was in fact a pointless and artificial exercise. There was a continuing mismatch between the loan balance and the supposed \"specific resources\" \"used\" by CSOB. The Director of the Risk and Funds Management Subdivision of CSOB in Bratislava attempted to explain this shortfall by claiming that no one within CSOB knew the actual balance of the SI loan for the whole of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995.135 CSOB\u2019s Finance Director, who was at the time working for KPMG, has admitted that the interest claimed did not match the funds used.136 For the Slovak Republic, this clearly demonstrates that CSOB breached the terms imposed on the use of method (c) and instead engaged in an artificial exercise.\n\nCf. Rejoinder D. Frishberg, No. 125-130, including charts 1 and 2.\n\nTR, April 16.2003,75:1-15, 87:17-21 (Majlingov\u00e1).\n\nTR, April 15, 2003, 173:11-175:10 (Cloughesy), referring to a memorandum of Mr. Cloughesy of May 14, 1997 (the Slovak Republic's April 2003 Hearing Documents for Mr. Cloughesy, Tab 2).\n\n250.\n\nCSOB has offered in these proceedings a review calculation of interest based on the analysis of its accounting and damages expert, who \"reconstructed\" the interest rates and made assumptions on the \"specific resources\" that had been available and that he used on some occasions to \"plug the difference\" between the loan balance and the specific resources CSOB had earmarked at the time.137 This expert observed that the balance of the SI loan used for CSOB's interest rate calculations did not exactly match the total sources of financing used to develop the interest rates.138 The interest calculated by CSOB\u2019s expert and based upon an electronic model, additional records and on recalculated data,139 were intended to reflect better the real cost of refinancing the loan.\n\nCf. TR, April 14.2003,49:5-14, 50:1-15, April 15.2003, 18:1-24:13 (Hart).\n\nExpert Report of T.H. Hart, No. 54.\n\nCf. TR April 14.2003, p. 43-51, 84 (Hart).\n\n251.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, it is impossible \"to restructure *post factum* a claim for historical costs, that was manifestly erroneous\". No adequate and true picture of the actual and precise historie costs of the refinancing can be based upon gaps in the historical cost analysis that were complemented with simulated added resources. The Slovak Republic objects that CSOB, based on the calculations of its expert, claims in these proceedings for each single quarter of the 38 quarters that the SI loan was in effect, interest rates different from the historical interest. For the Slovak Republic, CSOB\u2019s \"recalculation\" of the interest rates is a clear admission that the historical interest rate, as claimed in its time, had been erroneous. The Slovak Republic therefore challenges CSOB's new calculations as they fabricated the \"specific resources\" that were to be used for the refinancing. These calculations were spurious, *a posteriori* and not in conformity with method (c) of Article 4 LA or any other method provided for by this provision. For the Slovak Republic, these new interest rates have never been approved by CSOB, SI or the Slovak Republic.\n\n*4. The actually fixed interest rates*\n--------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the interest rates determined by CSOB's staff under Article 4 LA were communicated to SI on a regular quarterly basis.140 In some instances, CSOB also sent estimations about rates that had to be expected in a near future. The specific interest rates for each of the quarters of 1994 and for the first quarter of 1995 had been partly approved, partly acknowledged at meetings of the SI Supervisory Board.141\n\nSee Statement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, Exh. 2.\n\nCf. Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 7, 11 and 13.\n\n253.\n\nAs the Slovak Republic has noted, the Supervisory Board did not approve interest rates for any other subsequent quarters. However, in its very first meeting, *i.e.* on July 1, 1994, the SI Supervisory Board, before specifying the specific interest rates for the first and second quarter of 1994, had agreed more generally that method (c) would be followed.142 This agreement is confirmed by the fact that the specific interest rates for the third quarter could not be determined at that time in advance for the only reason that the actual costs were not known yet. As Article 4 LA specifies, method (c) required \"fixing the interest rate so as to reflect the price of the sources used by the Bank to refinance the loan.\" The Board decided that for the 3rd quarter of 1994 \"the interest rates will be fixed after CSOB determines the price of the sources.\"\n\nStatement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 7.\n\n254.\n\nAs CSOB pointed out, Article 4 LA does not require any agreement of the parties on the interest rate to be applied for each quarter.143 Indeed, this provision states that the rate shall be \"floating\" and \"to be fixed\" quarterly, following one of the methods indicated under (a), (b) and (e). In the modified version of paragraph 1, as agreed upon in Amendment No. 7 of April 18.1996, the term \"adjustment\" was used instead of \"fixed\". Further, there is a reference to the Bank's need for refinancing. This indicates not only that the Bank had to reach a level that permitted it to keep the loan cost-neutral, but also, as a matter of policy and practical application, that the Bank was the pertinent entity to determine its own need for refinancing the loan. The methods provided under (a), (b) and (c) were sufficiently precise in this respect not to allow the Bank to fix interest rates not in compliance with the ultimate goal of the LA. In one of its answers given to questions raised by the Tribunal at the April 2003 hearing, the Slovak Republic stated that the LA \"does not afford SI any opportunity to approve, reject, or even comment on the interest rates set by CSOB\".\n\nOn its meeting held on December 1, 1994, the SI Supervisory Board ordered the executive to prepare an amendment to the LA where the interest rate would be fixed by an agreement between CSOB and SI (Statement E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 10). Such amendment has not been concluded. This confirms that at the time, no acceptance of the rates by SI was formally required.\n\n255.\n\nThe method used by CSOB and SI for the practical implementation fully confirms this reading of Article 4 LA. All communications sent by CSOB to SI on the fixing of the interest rate for each relevant quarter were sent for the purpose of \"information\". No agreement of SI was requested nor required. The fact that the first five quarterly rates were \"approved\" by SI\u2019s Supervisory Board is of no influence on the understanding that no such acceptance was required. Therefore, all rates communicated later, when the Supervisory Board no longer approved interest rates, were valid acts for the implementation of Article 4 LA in the relations between CSOB and SI. This was all the more so as neither SI nor the Slovak Republic's representatives who exercised control over SI never raised an objection as to the actual fixing of the interest rates on the loan by CSOB. The Tribunal adds that such mutual understanding and conduct of the parties involved in these dealings further demonstrates that there can be no room for any hypothetical *a* *posteriori* fixing of interest rates that would not comply with the actual (or also called historical) rates as they were fixed pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 LA.\n\n256.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the interest rates under the loan that are relevant to determine the loss SI actually suffered and that triggered the Slovak Republic's obligation for coverage are the interest rates that were actually charged by CSOB to SI on the basis of Article 4 LA. Relevant in this respect is the understanding that both CSOB and SI had of the proper operation of this provision at the time of its conclusion as well as in light of their subsequent conduct during its practical implementation. SI\u2019s conduct is particularly relevant in this regard, as SI acted under the full control of the Slovak Republic that had ultimately to cover the losses composed of CSOB's interest charges. As this is a matter of interpretation of the LA under Slovak law, the Tribunal notes that the pertinent factors under Section 266 of the Slovak Commercial Code are in this respect the same than those referred to in the corresponding provision of the Czech Commercial Code, that have been explained above.\n\n257.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, it has to be mentioned that CSOB has moreover argued that the costs it sustained on the loan were much more substantial than the interest payments granted under Article 4 LA, especially when such interest was not paid. As the SI loan grew to constitute as much as 70% of CSOB\u2019s total SKK asset portfolio, CSOB ultimately had to raise funds to satisfy existing liabilities through the issuance of bonds, conversion of foreign currency and borrowing overnight deposits on the inter-bank market. For the Tribunal, these considerations are not material. In order to know what interest SI had to pay on the loan, only the provisions of the LA and their implementation by the Parties are relevant.\n\n*5. Interest calculation related to the currency split of the loan*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nOn May 25, 1994, CSOB and SI concluded Amendment No. 1 to the LA to modify section 1 (a) of the LA as follows -\n\nOn July 1, 1994, the Bank has provided the Client with the following loans:\n\n- SKK 5,284,795.781.91  \n- CZK 1,055,000.000\n\nfor the covering of receivables assigned to its Client as of December 31.1993...\n\n259.\n\nThe SI loan was thus split into two currencies, with the Czech crown (hereinafter \"CZK\") bearing an interest rate of 5 basis points lower than the Slovak crown portion. This was done to address partially the high costs to CSOB for refinancing a loan exclusively in SKK, while the interest for CZK was lower.\n\n260.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, Amendment No. 1 clearly stated that the Bank *has provided* SI on July 1, 1994 with the loan amounts specified. Consequently, interest would only accrue as from that date. Therefore, in the Slovak Republic\u2019s view, CSOB has improperly computed interest before July 1, 1994. Consequently, CSOB has overstated its claim for interest to the extent of SKK 2,180,627.907.\n\n261.\n\nCSOB admits that the terms of Amendment No. 1 may be \"somewhat ambiguous\". For CSOB, this ambiguity is, however, corrected by the fact that the Minutes of SI\u2019s Supervisory Board of July 1, 1994 did not indicate that the loans would be newly made on July 1, 1994. These Minutes only approved the denomination in CZK of part of the existing loan granted in SKK.\n\n262.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has pointed out that the fact that these Minutes did not indicate that the loans were new, is not a reason to conclude that SI would have accepted a mere adjustment of the existing loans, contrary to the text of the Amendment itself. Indeed, Amendment No. 1 considered the CZK loan as new, where it determined the interest rate that had to be paid and the repayment that had to be made.\n\n263.\n\nHowever, it follows from the text of Amendment No. 1 itself that it only split the existing loan. Firstly, the \"Amendment\" indicated that it \"modified\" on May 25, 1994, \"the amount of the loan\" granted under the Loan Agreement, concluded on December 31, 1993. Consequently, the loan of SKK 6,521,108.081.91 was merely divided into a loan denominated in SKK and one denominated in CZK.\n\n264.\n\nSecondly, the Amendment only contained provisions for the CZK loan: its interest rate was fixed on the basis of the existing interest rate for the SKK loan (Section 4). Its conditions of repayment were a modification of the existing conditions for the SKK loan. Consequently, the SKK loan remained governed by the loan agreement. Amendment No. 1 only reduced the amount of the principal in SKK and introduced a separate CZK loan. Therefore, Amendment No. T offers no ground to argue that interest on the SKK Loan was only due as of July 1.1994.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal also fails to see how it could deduce from Amendments No. 2-9 that no interest was due before July 1, 1994. On the contrary, Amendment No. 3, approved by SI, indicates that interest were calculated on the SKK loan as from January 1, 1994. Besides, the Slovak Republic\u2019s argument that is based upon the use, in Amendment No. 1, of the terms \"On July 1, 1994, the bank has *provided*... with the following loans\", is not convincing. Amendment N\u00b0 4 of May 31, 1995 similarly states that \"On July 1, 1995, the bank has *provided* the following loans.\" But none of the Parties has argued that in fact the loans started on July 1, 1995. Consequently, for the Parties, \"provide\" did not mean \"create\", but \"keep at disposition\".\n\n*6. Capitalization of interest*\n-------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nCSOB has included in its claim the capitalization on a quarterly basis of the interest allegedly overdue (Art. 4 LA).144\n\nFor the SKK-loans, the quarterly capitalization of interest started on June 28, 1996, the date of default, although SI had not paid interest for the first and second quarter of 1995 (cf. Expert Opinion of T.H. Hart, Exh. 14 and 15; Expert Reply, No. 100). For the CSK-portion of the loan, capitalization occurred on September 29, 1995, March 29, 1996, and April 30, 1995 (cf. Rejoinder of D. Frishberg, No. 101).\n\n267.\n\nThe capitalization was retroactively carried out on April 10, 1997, the date of the loan call. As of December 31, 2002, this capitalization was evaluated by the Slovak Republic to amount to SKK 11,574,157.624.145 CSOB alleged that this amount was incorrect and that the compound interest amounted to SKK 9,225,784.406.146\n\nCf. Rejoinder D. Frishberg, Exh. 34.\n\nCSOB Post Hearing Submission on issues addressed at the hearing of April 2003, No. 190.\n\n268.\n\nBefore entering into this analysis, a preliminary issue needs to be clarified, that is the difference between \"compound interest\", *i.e.* the term often used by CSOB in the present proceedings, and \"capitalization of interest\", *i.e.* the term used by the Slovak Republic.\n\n269.\n\nUnder Slovak and Czech law, there is apparently a difference between \"capitalization of interest\" and compounding \"interest on interest\". Under the former, the outstanding interest is converted into the loan principal; under the latter, interest is charged on overdue and unpaid interest amounts. However, although both techniques are different, they have a similar effect. Consequently, for the present analysis, the term \"capitalization of interest\" will be used.147 This semantic choice, however, does not prejudge the later discussion of CSOB\u2019s argument with regard to its title to charge interest on overdue interest amounts on SI's current account with CSOB.\n\nAlso CSOB has used the term capitalization, *e.g.* its Reply of August 31, 2001, p. 74; Expert Reply of T.H. Hart, No. 112; Reply Opinion of Professor Oveckov\u00e1, No. 19.\n\n270.\n\nUnder Slovak law, which, it may be recalled, governs the LA, interest may only be capitalized with the agreement of the parties (Commercial Code, Section 502) or when it is a \"common commercial practice in the particular line of business and is not contradicted by the agreement of the parties\" (Commercial Code, Section 264).\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal will first explore the possibility that the parties have agreed upon capitalization (a), thereafter whether capitalization is a \"common commercial practice\" pertinent for the instant case (b) and, finally, whether other arguments would justify capitalization (c).\n\n*a. The agreement of the parties to the LA.*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe analysis starts from Article 5 of the Loan Agreement which reads as follows -\n\n*Capitalization of Interest*\n\nUntil December 31, 1994, interest shall be capitalized by. adding it to the principal of the loan on each of the following dates:\n\nMarch 31,1994  \nJune 30,1994  \nSeptember 30,1994  \nDecember 31,1994.\n\n273.\n\nThe agreement contained in Article 5 LA to capitalize interest up to December 31, 1994 relates to the fact that under Articles 3 and 6, as well as under the Repayment Schedule, the first installment to repay the loan was deferred until March 31.1995. For the Slovak Republic, any capitalization after March 31, 1995 is therefore *a contrario* excluded by Article 5.\n\n274.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, however, no decisive conclusion on capitalization in the event of default can be drawn from Article 5 LA. Indeed, this provision addressed a completely different hypothesis, *i.e.* capitalization for the period in respect of which the parties, in common agreement and as provided for in the LA itself, had deferred any payment of capital and interest.\n\n275.\n\nOn the other hand, it is correct to say that the Parties did not explicitly agree on a capitalization of interest after December 1994.\n\n276.\n\nCSOB, for its part, has alleged that such agreement could be inferred from the stipulations in Articles 4 and 6 of the LA that interest had to be paid on a quarterly basis as of March 31, 1995. The fact that interest had to be paid on a quarterly basis as of March 31, 1995 offers, however, no basis for capitalization in case of default. The Tribunal notes that in Appendix No. 1 to the Second Assignment Agreement concluded between CSOB and the Czech Republic on June 25, 1998,148 it is stated expressly that the loan principal was increased by capitalized interest for the year 1994. If capitalized interest was agreed and effectively made as from 1995 or later as from the date of SI\u2019s default, one would expect that this would have been mentioned in this Agreement.\n\nReply Statement of P. Kov\u00e1nek, Exh. 10.\n\n277.\n\nCSOB furthermore relied on its own General Terms and Conditions in effect in the Slo vak Republic149 to claim capitalization of interest. The LA, however, did not refer to these General Conditions. Therefore, they cannot be considered incorporated by reference into the agreement of the Parties. Moreover, even if these Conditions had been part of the agreement, they would not allow CSOB to capitalize overdue interest. Article 7 of Part I of the Conditions only provides for \"positive\" capitalization, not \"negative\" capitalization, as does Section 714 Slovak Commercial Code. It only provides for posting earned interest (so that accrued interest are compounded); it does not provide for capitalization of interest to be paid. In a separate provision of the Conditions, *i.e.* Article 4(5) of Part III, that covers interest to be charged on an overdue negative balance, only a penalty interest rate - and no negative capitalization - is provided for. A similar provision on penalty was agreed upon in the current account agreement concluded between CSOB and SI.150\n\nFurther Statement of J. Sterbov\u00e1, Exh. 1 (effective as of March 1, 1996), Exh. 2 (effective as of January 1, 1994).\n\nStatement of J. Sterbov\u00e1, Exh. 1.\n\n278.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that CSOB has failed to show that the Loan Agreement allows for capitalization of overdue interest.151\n\nSee also Reply Opinion of Professor Oveckov\u00e1, No. 19, where it is said that the parties to the LA \"expected\" that interest would automatically be capitalized. However, this expert later admitted that the LA does not contain an agreement on compound interest after December 31, 1994 (TR, November 10, 2002, 43:1244:13, 62:6-9, 65:15-18, 67:2-25, 68:1-18). She also did not find any specific business practice (TR, November 10, 2002, 45:22-25).\n\n*b. Capitalization as \"common business practice\"*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe question has been raised whether there is a \"common business practice\" in banking loans to capitalize interest in the event of default.\n\n280.\n\nFor CSOB, the capitalization of interest after March 31, 1995 resulted moreover from Section 264 of the Slovak Commercial Code. Under this provision, \"common business practices, generally observed in the particular line of business, have to be taken into account to determine contractual obligations, if they are not contradicted by the content of the contract\". CSOB contends that capitalization was such common practice. CSOB and SI had agreed not only on what the text of the LA explicitly states, but also on what the parties intended and what was customary trade practice.\n\n281.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, no evidence was given that such practice existed in the Slovak banking world. At most, CSOB stated in general terms that capitalization was a general practice of the banking world at large.\n\n282.\n\nFor the Tribunal, CSOB did not submit convincing evidence as to the existence of a common business practice that was therefore by implied agreement also applicable to CSOB in its relationship to SI. Indeed, CSOB\u2019s own behavior towards SI has indicated that it did not consider capitalization the general rule that was also applicable to SI. As CSOB stated in these proceedings, interest capitalization was adopted by its accounting expert starting with the date of SI\u2019s default on June 28, 1996. This capitalization was thus introduced *a posteriori,* while it was not claimed at the actual time when interest were adjusted quarterly by CSOB and communicated to SI. This confirms that there was no \"common business practice\" to support interest capitalization in the instant case.\n\n*c. Other arguments*\n--------------------\n\n283.\n\nCSOB has argued that there is a substantial difference between \"capitalization\", *i.e.* the conversion of outstanding interest into loan principal, and compounding interest-on-interest, *i.e.* charging interest on overdue interest amounts. In this perspective, Article 5 LA has only indicated that interest would be capitalized for 1994; it does not affect the compounding of interest-on-interest. Even if Slovak law were to exclude CSOB\u2019s capitalization in the absence of an agreement to that effect, compounding interest-on-interest would still be possible. This distinction between \"capitalization\" and \"interest-on-interest\" would be crucial in view of SI\u2019s current account, which was debited to cover SI\u2019s payments. According to CSOB, negative interest-on-interest could be charged on this current account.\n\n284.\n\nFor the present dispute, however, it is irrelevant whether interest is charged on negative interest in current accounts. Before April 10, 1997, when the loan was called, no capitalization was claimed; on the contrary, all documents emanating from CSOB and addressed to SI and to the MF SR referred to non-capitalized interest. As of April 10, 1997, the Slovak Republic\u2019s obligation to cover losses was triggered for the losses that existed at that date. Therefore, it is irrelevant to determine whether SI\u2019s current account was actually closed on April 18, 1997, as the Slovak Republic alleges, or after May 18, 1998, as CSOB argues.\n\n285.\n\nCSOB has also invoked the fact that third parties, such as KPMG, SI\u2019s Bankruptcy Trustee, an Expert Commission and the National Bank of Slovakia, all allegedly have accepted that the interest due under the LA could be capitalized.\n\n286.\n\nHowever, acceptance by third parties is no proof that the lender was entitled to capitalize interest to be paid by the borrower. Moreover, the KPMG audit did not address the issue whether the interest CSOB claimed was legally due. Moreover, when, in the bankruptcy proceedings, SI had included interest-on-interest in its declaration of debts towards CSOB, SI\u2019s Trustee in Bankruptcy objected globally to CSOB\u2019s calculation of interest, thus including the capitalization.152 Furthermore, the Expert Commission did not ratify capitalization either. It had only to decide whether the receivables had been assigned in conformity with the agreement between the Parties and not whether interest could be capitalized.153 Finally, the National Bank only examined the changed accounting treatment of the SI loan when it was transferred from the Bratislava branch to the Prague branch of CSOB; it did not render a statement on the capitalization.\n\nExh. A to the Slovak Republic's Observations on CSOB\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, January 19, 2000.\n\nCf. Report of February 13.1997, Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 34.\n\n287.\n\nCSOB contended that it regularly accounted for compound interest and informed SI as well as the MF SR of the status of SI\u2019s account, but that neither of them raised any objection. However, CSOB did not submit contemporary documents to prove that it claimed capitalization from SI, nor that the MF SR was informed of this capitalization at that time.154\n\n*E.g.* the letter sent by SI to the MF SR on September 11, 1995, containing a quantification of funds required from the state budget, does not mention capitalization (cf. Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 17).\n\n288.\n\nFinally, CSOB relied on another argument of its accounting and damages expert, namely that SI would have had no incentive to bring the loan out of default without capitalization, the additional 2% interest was ineffective to secure a timely payment because it would over time be neutralized by the absence of capitalization so that the interest-sanction would be well below the actual benefit of not paying.155\n\nExpert Reply of T.H. Hart, No. 102-106.\n\n289.\n\nHowever, under the CA, CSOB could request the Slovak Republic at any time to cover SI\u2019s losses and to provide SI with sufficient funds to cover the payments that were due. In the event that SI were to continue to be in default, CSOB could rescind the LA and declare the loan and other amounts immediately payable (Art. 11 LA). This was the most effective deterrent Ito secure timely payments.\n\n*7. The amount of interest included in the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 respective experts have offered their own analysis of the proper application of Article 4 LA that are based on calculations made *a posteriori* for the purpose of these proceedings. As they are admittedly different from the interest rates that were applied effectively in the relation between CSOB and SI and to the full knowledge of the MF SR's representatives, the Tribunal finds that they cannot constitute a basis for a decision on this matter.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal, at the April 2003 hearing, asked the Parties-\n\nif possible, the Tribunal would appreciate to receive the interest rates asked by the Bank, quarter by quarter, since 1994 until now. If possible, also, with details, for instance, we are thinking of the document which has been submitted and how this amount could be financed by the different sources of funds available. If this documentation is available.156\n\nOne important item for calculation is the actual amount of the outstanding loan for each quarter that takes account of the progress in reaching maturity of the OBS receivables and of the repayments made by the FTOs and credited to SI\u2019s account with CSOB. In reply, CSOB referred to the calculations of its accounting expert, to CSOB's letters fixing quarterly interest rates and to the SI Supervisory Board meetings.157 However, this documentation does not allow a new calculation of the interest evolution with the rates actually used, as CSOB's expert used his own and different rates and as the other materials contain very little and anyhow insufficient information about the evolution of the principal loan amount. In response to the Tribunal's question, the Slovak Republic observed that CSOB had not produced any contemporaneous documents showing the total running balance of the SI loan.158 CSOB's accounting expert did not recall an overall summary and he referred to the KPMG report,159 that is, however, not periodic and did not serve as support for CSOB's quarterly calculations. For some quarters, the loan balance was not available at the time when the refunding had to be determined and the quarterly interest rate to be fixed.160\n\nTR, April 17, 2003, 170:7-14, see also April 18.2003, 87:16-23.\n\nCSOB's Post Hearing Submission on issues addressed at the hearing of April 2003, Tab A, No. 20.\n\nThe Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial, Tab A, Question 18, p. 10; TR, April 18, 2003, 162:15-163:17.\n\nTR, April 15.2003, 9:12-10:9 (Hart).\n\nTR, April 16.2003, 75:1-15, 87: 17-21 (Majlingov\u00e1).\n\n292.\n\nUntil the day, on April 10, 1997, when CSOB called the full amount of the loan from SI and claimed damages in the corresponding amount from the Slovak Republic, the actual quarterly rates determined under Article 4 LA were as follows, for each quarter -\n\n1994: 18.84%, 18.59%, 21.27%, 18.91%;  \n1995: 17.73%, 17.75%, 8.86%, 8.61%;  \n1996: 12.70%, 14.19%, 12.05%, 13.70%;  \n1997; 12.91%, 14.53%.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal has to apply these rates to the amount of the loan principal. As the amount relied upon differs from the amounts on the basis of which the Parties\u2019 calculations were made, no documentation is on the Tribunal\u2019s file that would show the result of such a detailed calculation. The principal amount to be retained is the amount accrued on April 10, 1997. However, this amount does not reflect the variations that occurred during the relevant period from 1994 through April 10, 1997, and that were caused, as mentioned above, by the increase, at irregular intervals, of the amount of the OBS loans and by the decrease of the loan, at equally irregular intervals, caused by repayments from the FTOs that amounted to a total of SKK 1,770,462.989 (respectively SKK 1,584,073.830 as of April 10, 1997). To run a calculation using actual interest rates, the Tribunal has to consider firstly the period covering the year 1994 when pursuant to Ar-tide 5 LA interest had to be capitalized by adding it to the principal at each quarter.\n\n294.\n\nThe only comprehensive statement from CSOB filed with the Tribunal and stating the full amount of all interest accrued and capitalized in 1994, including the OBS items, is contained in CSOB's application addressed to the Regional Court in Bratislava on June 23, 1998.161 According to this document, when adding all interest capitalized determined for each portion of the loan, the total amount is SKK 1,588,098.324.45.162 The Tribunal relies on this amount. Other documents contain different figures, relating to parts of the loans only and are therefore less reliable, in respect of the on-balance163 as well as the off-balance164 receivables. From the amount indicated above, an amount of SKK 1,749,967.77 has to be deducted that corresponds to capitalized interest for 1994 charged in relation to the Intercoop receivable that is not included by the Tribunal. The Omnia receivable is not to be considered in this respect, as it was transferred with effect in 1995 only. The total amount of capitalized interest for 1994 is therefore SKK 1,586,348.356.68.\n\nStatement I. Cestr, Tab C, filed with CSOB's Request for Provisional Measures of September 4, 1998; the. Slovak Republic's Observations on CSOB's Request for Provisional Measures of January 19, 2000, Exh. B; the Slovak Republic's Hearing Exhibits, November 2002, Tab 9.\n\nAs CSOB's application also refers to Amendment No. 9 to the LA, the Tribunal understands that this figure already includes the correction of the interest for 1994 on the Czech portion of the Ioan as it was agreed.\n\nCf. Amendment No. 3 to the LA; CSOB's Memorial, Tab B, No. 24; Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 14, Development of the loan in 1994, document to be reviewed at the meeting of the Supervisory Board of SI on May 22, 1995. The amounts mentioned in this documentation are at variance to CSOB's bankruptcy application mostly in respect of the exchange rate applied to the CZK portion.\n\nSome amounts, close to those mentioned in CSOB's bankruptcy application, can be found in some Amendments to OBS Loan Agreements, *i.e.* No. 3 (Slovart), 3 (Intercoop), 3 (Istroconti), 5 (Chirana), 4 (Elteco).\n\n295.\n\nFor the interest calculation relating to the subsequent period, from January 1, 1995 to April 10, 1997, the Tribunal has to take account of three different \"floating\" factors, *i.e.* the interest rates fixed quarterly, the repayments in the total amount of SKK 1,584,073.830 and the irregular accrual of the loan relating to the OBS assets.\n\n296.\n\nOn December 31, 1994, the outstanding loan principal was composed of the on-balance loan portion (as adjusted) of SKK 6,469,439.886.91,. an amount of SKK 2,341,923.443.23,165 corresponding to the at that time extended loans for OBS items, and the 1994 interest of SKK 1,586,348.356.68, resulting in a total of SKK 10,397,711.687.\n\nCf. Expert Report of T.H. Hart, Exh. 15 (Summary of SI loan activity, off balance sheet portion). For a slightly different amount (SKK 2,312,328.356.83), provided with few details only, cf. Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 14, Development of the loan in 1994, document to be reviewed at the meeting of the Supervisory Board of SI on May 22, 1995.\n\n297.\n\nIn order to run an interest calculation as from January 1, 1995, account has to be taken of the CZK portion of the loan which produces, pursuant to Amendment No. 3 of the LA, an interest of 5% lower than the interest applicable to the SKK portion.\n\n298.\n\nAccording to Amendment No. 3 to the LA, the amount of the CZK portion of the loan was at December 31, 1994 CZK 1,144,555.351.16, including capitalized interest for 1994 in the amount of CZK 89,555,351.16.166 Expressed in SKK, the corresponding full amount is SKK 1,276,179.217.167 The SKK portion of the loan to be retained as of January 1, 1995 is therefore SKK 9,121,532.470.\n\nCf. CSOB's Memorial, Tab B, No. 24. The figure referred to does not include the correction agreed upon in Amendment No. 9 LA.\n\nTo the Tribunal's knowledge, the exchange rate at that time was 1,115 (cf. Expert Opinion of T.H. Hart, Exh. 5). Another rate (1.1798) results from the document on the development of the loan attached to the Minutes of meeting No. 6 of the SI Supervisory Board of May 22, 1995 (Statement of E. Kalinov\u00e1, Exh. 14), but it is qualified as an estimated rate for 1995.\n\n299.\n\nIn respect of the CZK portion of the loan, *i.e.* CZK 1,144,555.351.16, when taking account, as explained above, of repayments168 and a reduction effective on March 29, 1996,169 the total accrual, as of April 10, 1997, is for the principal CZK 976,880,012, corresponding to SKK 1,094,105.613, and for actual quarterly interest CZK 126,749,082, corresponding to SKK 141,958,972.170\n\nIt has been reported to the Tribunal that repayments on the CZK portion (principal and interest) had been, made between April 3, 1995 and August 30, 1996, at irregular intervals, in a total amount of CZK 228,473,804.52 (principal CZK 161,192,027.45, interest CZK 67,281,777.07), cf. Expert Report of T.H. Hart, Exh. 14, and Expert Reply, Exh. 39, where the portions per quarter can be found. (For a slightly different principal amount - CZK 158,966,021 -, cf. CSOB's Memorial, Tab B, No. 17, 19, 23, 24). The amount retained corresponds to SKK 256,142,705.03 (principal SKK 179,924,101.21, interest SKK 76,218,603.82), cf. Expert Report of T.H. Hart, Exh. 4 and Expert Reply, Exh. 39.\n\nAs mentioned above, a reduction of the loan amount by CZK 6,483,311.27 had been agreed upon in Amendment No. 9 to the LA, effective on March 29, 1996, in order to rectify an incorrect application of capitalized interest for 1994.\n\nThe exchange rate retained as for April 10, 1997 is 1.12. It is lower than the rate provided by CSOB's accounting expert for March 27, 1997 (1,128; cf. Expert Report of T.H. Hart, Exh. 5). At the relevant time, the exchange rate decreased significantly; this allows a reduction occurring after two weeks only.\n\n300.\n\nIn respect of the SKK portion of the loan, *i.e.* SKK 9,121,532.470, when taking into account, as indicated above, the OBS loan accrual171 and the repayments172 related to the relevant period, the total accrual, as of April 10, 1997, is for the principal SKK 9,252,592.171 and for the actual quarterly interest SKK 2,875,959.936.\n\nCf. Expert Report of T.H. Hart, Exh. 15. However, the Tribunal does not include the loan accrual related to receivables it does not retain in respect of the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation. Thus, the amounts related to Technopol loan amendments above No. 36, all dated later than October 14, 1996, are not computed. The same applies to the Intercoop receivable in the amount of SKK 31,661,730.53; as the Tribunal cannot identify the date as from which the respective loan disbursement had been computed, and considering that it was agreed that this loan produced capitalized interest in 1994, the Tribunal operates the corresponding reduction for its interest computation together with the first accrual of interest in 1995.\n\nThe repayments on the SKK portion are, as of April 10.1997, in a total amount of SKK 1,584,073.830, less the repayments computed with the CZK portion of the loan, SKK 256,142,705, *i.e.* SKK 1,327,931.125.\n\n301.\n\nAs of April 10, 1997, the principal amount became, when taking account of the OBS loan accrual, the repayments and a loan reduction, SKK 10,346,697.784. At the same date, the accrued interest amounts to a total of SKK 3,017,918.908.\n\n302.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that CSOB's title to principal and interest as of April 10.1997 is in an amount of SKK 13,364,616.692.\n\n*8. Article 8 of the Loan Agreement*\n------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nCSOB has claimed an additional SKK 1.2 billion based on Article 8 of the Loan Agreement.\n\n304.\n\nArticle 8 LA reads as follows -\n\n*Contractual Penalty*\n\nThe Customer and the Bank have agreed that if there is an event of default under this Agreement, the Bank shall be entitled to exercise vis-\u00e0-vis the Customer a sanction remedy consisting of an increase in the interest rate pursuant to Section 4 hereof by two percent per annum.\n\n305.\n\nOn the basis of this provision and the information given by its accounting expert, CSOB has claimed 2% of the interest on the balance of the loan outstanding as of December 31, 1996. In fact, the loan was in default already on June 28.1996. CSOB's payment request addressed to SI on August 18, 1996 informed SI that due to the breach ofthe Credit Agreement and in accordance with its Article 8, it would be charging interest increased by 2%.173 On the basis of CSOB's notification of quarterly interest rates to SI, it appears that the 2% interest increase was claimed for the first time on July 1, 1997 for the third quarter of 1997.174\n\nStatement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 20.\n\nStatement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, Exh. 2.\n\n306.\n\nThe Slovak Republic denies CSOB the right to claim this amount under the CA. It argues that Article 8 LA is a \"penalty clause\" and not a default interest provision.\n\n307.\n\nUnder Slovak law, a default interest provision, governed by Section 735 of the Commercial Code, is an appurtenance to the receivable. Under Section 121(3) of the Slovak Civil Code: \"The appurtenances of a receivable are interest due, default interest...\". The interest is due and no separate security needs to be established to claim the amount from the debtor. A penalty clause, on the contrary, governed by Sections 544 and 545 of the Civil Code and Sections 300-302 of the Commercial Code, is distinct from the underlying loan. It is not an appurtenance to a receivable.\n\n308.\n\nThe fact that the heading of Article 8 is \"contractual penalty\", by itself, may not be compelling evidence. Nevertheless, this heading is important, at least, as the expression of the parties\u2019 understanding at the time of the conclusion of the LA. The wording of Article 8 LA clarifies the meaning of the title. Indeed, the terms \"a sanction remedy consisting of an increase in the interest rate\", indicate that the parties had a sanction of a penalty type in mind. CSOB\u2019s Slovak law experts equally envisaged that Article 8 LA was a penalty clause.175\n\nOpinion of Professor J. Bejcek, No. 107; TR, November 10.2002, 75:5-9 (Oveckov\u00e1).\n\n309.\n\nIt was mentioned that the qualification of Article 8 LA as a \"penalty clause\" had an advantage for SI, because a penalty clause could be reduced whenever it was judged to be excessive in the actual circumstances. It has, furthermore, been suggested that the interest rate of Article 4 LA was rather low so that CSOB sustained losses when SI did not repay capital and interest on time and that, therefore, the 2% should not be reduced. CSOB has also argued that it was entitled under the CA to claim from the Slovak Republic the 2%, even when it was not able to claim payment of the penalty clause directly from the Slovak Republic. In CSOB\u2019s view, CSOB remained entitled to claim the 2 % from the Slovak Republic under the CA, because the Slovak Republic\u2019s breach of the CA made it impossible for CSOB to obtain from SI these 2%.\n\n310.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, what is decisive in these proceedings are not the legal implications of Article 8 LA in the relation between CSOB and SI, but the Slovak Republic's obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses as determined by Article 3(II) CA. The Slovak Republic's obligation to \"secure\" the loan was explicitly recorded in Article 7 LA and was covered specifically by the Slovak Republic's Finance Minister's approval declaration at the end of the LA. The Tribunal finds that weight has to be given to the place attributed to this provision by the parties to the LA, with the consent of the MF SR. Indeed, Article 7 LA follows all relevant provisions of this Agreement on interest and repayment (Articles 3 through 6). It is placed before Article 8 on \"Contractual Penalty\". This indicates that the \"security\" clause of Article 7 and the statement made by the MF SR in this respect was not intended to cover also SI\u2019s contractual penalty undertaking under Article 8.\n\n311.\n\nFurther, the parties\u2019 conduct does not reveal an understanding that the penalty under Article 8 LA was an inherent part of the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation. Already when SI was in default on June 28, 1996, CSOB claimed that it would add a 2% default charge, but it did not mention the additional 2% when it informed SI of the interest rates for the third and fourth quarter of 1996 and for the first and second quarter of 1997. The 2 % were claimed from SI for the first time in CSOB's acceleration letter of April 18, 1997 and charged for the first time on July 1, 1997 for the third quarter of 1997..176 In the course of these proceedings, the 2% have retroactively been calculated as of December 31.1996, but no claim has been addressed to SI in this respect. The Tribunal notes also that while SI was informed of the 2% penalty in the above mentioned letter of April 18.1997, the letter sent by CSOB to the Slovak Republic on April 10.1997, where the Slovak Republic was called to secure the total amount of the outstanding loan receivable, does not contain any mention of a 2% interest increase.177\n\nStatement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, Exh. 2.\n\nA similar understanding seems to be correct in respect of the letter sent by CSOB to the MF SR on September 5.1996 (Statement of P. Kav\u00e1nek, Exh. 21).\n\n312.\n\nMoreover, as this has already been recalled, the Slovak Republic's obligation consisted in the coverage of SI\u2019s losses resulting from its obligation to pay CSOB's loan that was extended \"up to the sum of considerations for the receivables assigned to the Collection Companies\" (Article 3(II)(3) CA). The Tribunal finds that SI\u2019s payment obligation under Article 8 LA towards CSOB goes beyond the \"sum of considerations for the receivables assigned\". Moreover, even if payments under Article 8 LA were considered as part of SI\u2019s loan repayment obligation, they do not relate, as they should under Article 3(II) CA, to a receivable specified at the latest on December 31, 1993. CSOB's claim for compensation of its damages arises under the CA and it cannot serve to extend indirectly the Slovak Republic's contractual obligations beyond the terms and content of Article 3(II) CA.\n\n313.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Tribunal concludes that a claim based on the CA against the Slovak Republic that would allow CSOB to recover payments provided for between CSOB and SI as parties to the LA and consisting of a 2% interest increase must be dismissed.\n\nD. Lost Profits and Interest on CSOB's Damage Claim\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nFor CSOB, compensation of the actual damages suffered because the Slovak Republic did not cover losses when requested in 1997 does not wipe out all the consequences of the Slovak Republic\u2019s default. CSOB claimed for SKK 13,175,225.718 billion \"lost profits\" as of December 31, 2002. It reduced this claim to SKK 7,857,193.540 for \"lost profits\" as of March 31, 2003.178 This claim is based upon the rate obtained if the money received from the SI loan would have been invested in Slovak Government Bonds.\n\nCSOB Post Hearing Submission on issues addressed at the hearing of April 2003, p. 103. This amount is the difference between the \"Slovak Bond Rate\" calculation (CSOB Hart Examination, Exh. 66) and the actual damage of SKK 32,443,747.036.\n\n315.\n\nCSOB offered flexibility in respect of the relevant rate to be retained when it referred to alternative solutions, in particular to Section 735 Czech Commercial Code, and further invited the Tribunal at the April 2003 hearing to \"take any rate you want\".179\n\nTR, April 18/2003, 78:8..\n\n*1. Procedural standing of CSOB's claim for lost profits*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nAt the April 2003 hearing, counsel for CSOB has indicated that CSOB would limit its claim to SKK 32,443,747.036 for actual damages, as he indicated that -\n\nin an effort, after these six years, now to render this phase of these already somewhat complex proceedings as simple as possible and to give the Tribunal a considerable measure of comfort in the correctness and in the justness of CSOB\u2019s claim, CSOB desires to assure the Tribunal that it will feel that justice has been done if it is awarded the full amount that it asserts as actual damages, the sum I have mentioned, as 32,443 billion Slovak Crowns.180\n\nTR, April 18, 2003, 68:1-23.\n\n317.\n\nThe Slovak Republic relies on this statement to conclude that CSOB has withdrawn the \"additional damages\" or additional losses claim.181\n\nThe Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial, p. 124.\n\n318.\n\nImmediately after the statement quoted above, counsel for CSOB continued -\n\nYou may rightly ask then: does the concept of lost profits then any longer have a role here ? My answer to that is: yes, most definitely.182\n\nCSOB's counsel then elaborated extensively on these lost profits. While CSOB declared thus that it was upholding its lost profit claim, its statement would nevertheless allow the interpretation that CSOB would accept that its total claim would not reach a figure above SKK 32,443 billion. Moreover, CSOB maintained its claim for lost profits in the restatement of claim in its post-hearing submissions.183\n\nTR, April 18.2003,68:24-25.69:1.\n\nCSOB's Post Hearing Submission on issues addressed at the hearing of April 2003, No. 258-263 and request on p. 103, part V 1(b); CSOB's Reply to the Slovak Republic's Second Post Hearing Memorial, No. 6, 150153.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that CSOB's oral statements were contradictory and partly confusing. However, they do not allow the conclusion that CSOB has withdrawn its \"lost profits\" claim, as such withdrawal would require a clear statement to that effect.\n\n*2. Concrete or abstract lost profits*\n--------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nFor CSOB, under Czech law, a claimant may base its profit claim either on the specific profit lost in a particular case (the so-called \"concrete\" lost profit) or on the profit attained in the line of business under conditions similar to those of the breached contract (the so-called \"abstract\" lost profit). Whether a claim is admitted on the basis of \"concrete\" or \"abstract\" lost profit depends upon the nature of the available evidence.\n\n321.\n\nSection 381 Commercial Code specifies the \"abstract\" lost profit as the -\n\nprofit usually achieved in fair business practices on terms and conditions in the line of business in which the injured party engages, which terms and conditions are similar to those breached.\n\n322.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, it is the average profit for the entire operations of a business without regard to the specific type of transaction.\n\n323.\n\nFor CSOB, this \"abstract\" profit is the transactional profit expected to be made on the performance of the contract at issue. CSOB argues that the language of Section 381 confirms that the abstract profit relates to the type of transactions involved. In business, profit follows from transactions not from year-end accounting performances for the company as a whole. When money is received from a transaction, it is invested in a similar transaction. The money received by CSOB from lending to SI would have been used to provide loans to other clients.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the abstract profit has to be based upon the specific type of transaction involved, *i.e.* loans. However, should the profitability of the loan be assessed on the basis of the market in the Slovak or in the Czech Republic ?\n\n325.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, only the profit on banking business in the Czech Republic should be considered, as the Czech Republic is the proper venue to assess the profits.\n\n326.\n\nFor CSOB, the potential profit made on re-lending the money from the SI loan to other customers has to be based upon the profit on loans in the Slovak Republic as this is the most appropriate country of reference. The loan was extended by CSOB\u2019s Slovak branch to a Slovak entity, was denominated in Slovak Crowns and was governed by Slovak law. The proceeds were intended to remain in the Slovak Republic and to be part of the Slovak CSOB spin-off. Under Section 737(1) Commercial Code, the abstract profit shall take account of \"the rate of profits usually attained in the country where the entitled person has his registered seat, place of business or residence.\" For CSOB, this provision thus allowed CSOB to opt for the profit in the Slovak market. Through its Slovak branch, it was doing business in that country. Moreover, that Slovak branch had its registered office in the Slovak Republic.184\n\nTR, November 11.2002,91:11-16 (D\u00ebdic).\n\n327.\n\nOn the basis of this provision and the CA's goal to promote CSOB business activity within the Slovak Republic, the Tribunal accepts that the profitability within the Slovak market is relevant. The conversion by CSOB and SI of part of the loan in a Czech Crown portion does not affect the fact that the losses the Slovak Republic had to cover remained in Slovak currency and were considered as such by the Parties.\n\n*3. The issue of evidence of CSOB's lost profits*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nUnder Czech law, as in other legal systems, lost profits can only be awarded when evidence has been submitted that it is not a mere speculation that profits would have been made if the breach had not occurred. For CSOB\u2019s legal expert, it had to be \"highly probable\" that profits would have been earned.185 For the Slovak Republic, CSOB has to prove that the amount of profits lost would *undoubtedly* have been achieved if the contract had been performed.186 The Czech Supreme Court has held that it should be proven \"with probability reasonably considered certainty that in the usual course of events\" the profit would have been made.187\n\nOpinion of Professor J. Bejcek, No. 116; see also TR, November 10.2002, 155:10-156:16 (D\u00e9di\u00e9).\n\nOpinion of Professor J. Bejcek, No. 114.\n\nOpinion of Professors Pohunek, Stuna, Svestka, No. 130.\n\n329.\n\nCSOB all\u00e8ges that, as a commercial bank, it undoubtedly would have reinvested the proceeds in other lending activities at a higher profit level than SI\u2019s loan that was designed to be not more than cost neutral. CSOB has, however, not substantiated its lost profit claim with an analysis of the profits banks operating in the Slovak Republic would actually have made on loans.\n\n330.\n\nFor the Slovak Republic, the profitability of the Slovak equity market was very low and even negative during certain periods of time.188\n\nOpinion of D. Berrey (Deloitte & Touche), No. 148-155.\n\n331.\n\nCSOB did find support for its lost profits on the basis of six very different approximate market indicators, with a wide range of results. It claims on the basis of the highest indicator, *i.e.* on the basis of the Slovak Government Bond Yield.\n\n332.\n\nHowever, CSOB did not establish that this indicator, or any other indicator, would have been the basis for actual profits. It did not present evidence that it would actually have been able to make loans on the basis of such interest rate and for such amounts had payments under the LA been made on time. It only established that CSOB and other banks purchased some Slovak state bonds at different times.189 However, it has not been proven that CSOB would have invested the whole amount from the SI loan in Slovak Government Bonds, *e.g.* in 1996, when their interest rate was at 42.53 %, probably reflecting not only a high inflation of the SKK, but also a higher risk of default. In fact, CSOB seemed to have a more prudent general investment policy, under which it held only a small portion in debt securities and an even much smaller portion in Slovak bonds.190\n\nStatement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 5; Reply Statement of S. Majlingov\u00e1, No. 31-35.\n\nRejoinder Opinion of D. Frishberg, No. 141.\n\n333.\n\nCSOB has argued that the interest rate of Slovak Government Bonds was a proper criterion to assess the profits lost, because Articles 9 and 10 LA provided for the possibility that the reimbursement of the SI loan would be financed with Slovak Government Bonds, which would probably to a large extent be purchased by CSOB whenever it had money to invest. The interest on these bonds, that have never been issued, constitutes the amount SI - and thus also the Slovak Republic - saved by not paying and thus by not having to issue bonds. Therefore, in CSOB\u2019s view, Slovak Government Bonds interest rates are a proper criterion to assess CSOB\u2019s lost profits.\n\n334.\n\nFor the Tribunal, however, the alleged evidence on CSOB\u2019s lost profits is unrelated to the costs SI and/or the Slovak Republic allegedly saved. Moreover, CSOB\u2019s argument is a mere hypothesis of which the constituent elements *(i.e.* issuance of bonds by SI or the Slovak Republic and purchase of those bonds by CSOB) remain uncertain.\n\n335.\n\nUnder Section 379 Commercial Code, the amount of lost profits must have been foreseeable when the CA was concluded. The Slovak Republic has argued that it would have been impossible to foresee the actual scope of its obligation to \"cover losses\" when the CA was signed in December 1993, as the actual amount of the loan was not known at that time.\n\n336.\n\nHowever, as the Tribunal has already noted above, the Slovak Republic had full knowledge of its obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses and of the scope of its exposure and the need to provide for the necessary budget. In particular, it accepted to provide for a net expenditure of the state budget in an amount of approximately SKK 13.3 billion until 2003. The Slovak Republic could thus foresee the maximum amount of its cover losses obligation and of its potential liability to cover CSOB's actual damages. When the Slovak Republic concluded the CA, it could have foreseen that CSOB would use the revenues from the loan to generate other loans and make profit. However, it could not have foreseen that CSOB would claim as lost profits an average of 18.98% per year for nearly 6 years. CSOB did not submit evidence to prove that the Slovak Republic could have foreseen such high lost profits margin.\n\n337.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Tribunal dismisses CSOB's claim for lost profit in so far that this claim requests the Slovak Republic's to compensate CSOB for an alleged loss of a potential investment in Slovak Government Bonds.\n\n*4. Interest on CSOB's damage claim*\n------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nCSOB recognized that providing interest on its damage claim is yet another solution to compensate for \"lost profits\" occurred and still occurring in respect of its damages accruing as from the time it formally requested the Slovak Republic, on April 10, 1997, to compensate CSOB for damages arising from the Slovak Republic's failure to cover SI\u2019s losses as provided for under Article 3(II)(5) CA.191 Such interest serve the purpose to let the damage claim accrue in such a way that full compensation is granted to the party entitled to it at the date of effective payment. Within this meaning, such interest can be considered, depending on the circumstances, as compensation for actual damage or for lost profits. However, as stated above, the Tribunal has not received evidence demonstrating that CSOB would have been in a position, had it received the Slovak Republic's payment promptly upon request (on April 10, 1997), to invest the respective amounts of money in a way to recover substantially more than the Bank was able to receive for credits extended on the relevant market. It is also to be noted that under Section 369(2) Commercial Code, the creditor is entitled to be compensated for damage caused by delay in the rendering of performance on monetary obligation \"only if such damage is not covered by the interest paid on the amount in arrears\". This provision indicates that interest is the ordinary remedy in case of default on a monetary obligation.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that when CSOB presented its final submission on June 20, 2003 *{supra,* paragraph 39), stating that it claimed the sum referred to \"as of March 31.2003\", it assumed that interest on \"actual damages\" is to be further carried forward from that date until the date of this Award. In other words, this final submission was not meant to withdraw the claim made in this respect in CSOB's preceding submissions.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied with the advise that the fact that under Slovak law, interest accrued since SI\u2019s declaration of bankruptcy is excluded from SI\u2019s bankruptcy does not prejudice its existence and ability to be claimed.192\n\nOpinion of Professor O. Oveckov\u00e1, No. 59.\n\n340.\n\nIn respect of interest accruing on its damage claim, CSOB offered as an alternative to apply Section 735 Commercial Code that provides for the following -\n\nDelay in Fulfilling a Monetary Obligation  \n On delay in fulfilling a monetary obligation, interest on the amount in arrears is payable in the same currency as the monetary obligation. The debtor is obliged to pay interest on the sum in arrears at a rate one per cent higher than the interest set under section 502, with the decisive rate of interest being the rate fixed or offered by banks on credits granted for a period corresponding to the debtor's default in the country where the debtor has his seat, place of business or home address.193\n\nThe quoted provision is part of a chapter on \"Special provisions on contractual relations in international trade\" that is applicable to the CA, as one of the parties has its seat, place of business or his home address on the territory of a country different from that of the other party and, further, as their relationship is governed by Czech law. CSOB did not explain for what reason such \"interest on the amount in arrears\" would be applicable to the instant case where interest has to be determined by the Tribunal in respect of damage resulting from the non payment by the Slovak Republic of the amounts that would have permitted to cover SI\u2019s losses. The Slovak Republic objected to the application of this provision to the determination of interest on CSOB's damage claim (except for post-award interest) and it argued that it had not had full opportunity to address this issue that was raised by CSOB as ah alternative only.\n\nSection 502 Commercial Code, referred to in Section 735 of the same Code, reads as follows -  \n (1) As of the day when the debtor is provided with the monetary resources, he shall pay interest on them at the agreed rate, or else at the maximum rate set by law or on the basis of law. If an interest rate is not fixed in this manner, the debtor must pay the usual rate of interest demanded on credits by banks at the place of the debtor's seat at the time of the conclusion of the contract. If the parties agree on a higher interest rate than the rate permitted by law or on the basis of law, the debtor is bound to pay the interest at the maximum permissible rate.  \n (2) In case of doubt, it is presumed that the agreed interest rate is interest per annum.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Section 735 Commercial Code concerns a monetary obligation that has already been fixed as to its amount and terms of payment and regulates the payment of interest as from the day of default. This provision does not cover the issue of interest determination as from April 10, 1997 as part of the compensation to be established by this Award. The Tribunal refers in this respect to the legal expert on which CSOB relied and who accepted interest to be determined on this legal basis only for the period after the date for the payment of compensation of damages as assessed by this Tribunal.194\n\nAdditional Expert Opinion of Professor J. D\u00ebdic, No. 159, page 78.\n\n342.\n\nThe CA does not provide for an interest rate to be applied to a damage claim resulting from a breach of an obligation contained therein.\n\n343.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the actual rate on April 1997 should not be retained for the whole period for which the Slovak Republic's payment was outstanding, as this has been argued by CSOB.195 Such a rate, fixed over years, would alter significantly the purpose of the interest allocation on a market with considerable changes in interest rates over the years, and, in particular, with notably lower rates in more recent years.\n\nTR, April 18.2003, 74:7-15.\n\n344.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal decides to retain the BRIBOR rate as determined by the National Bank of Slovakia for lending money on a three months basis. In the Tribunal's view, the 3-months BRIBOR rate can be considered under the particular circumstances of the Slovak Republic's obligation to cover SI\u2019s losses as a solution most closely based on the trade usages to which the Czech Commercial Code refers (Sections 264 and 730). This rate is thus applied to the damage amount retained at April 10, 1997.\n\n345.\n\nThe Parties have provided the Tribunal with a chart of the quotations for the three-months BRIBOR rate as from the first quarter of 1994 until the last quarter of 2004. The Tribunal notes that it had indicated that it was considering this rate at the April 2003 hearing when it invited the Parties to submit an update of the relevant quotations.196 None of the Parties has raised objections against this question or argued that it was irrelevant.\n\nTR, April 16.2003, 123:25-124:4, April 17.2003, 170:15-25\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal relies on the quotations cited by both Parties. In respect of the quotations for the third and fourth quarter of 1997, that CSOB alleges that it was not quoted, whereas the Slovak Republic asserts that it was quoted, the Tribunal observes that the tables copied from the Slovak National Bank's website indicate that the quotation of the BRIBOR rate was temporarily stopped;197 on the other hand, the Slovak Republic's accounting expert indicates that the quotations he refers to were obtained by comparison or as a \"substitute\"198. Therefore, the Tribunal deems appropriate to bridge the gap by using the average between the two closest rates, *i.e.* the second quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. For the fourth quarter of 1998, for which both Parties state that no quotation was available, the Tribunal applies the same method.\n\nCf. Expert Reply of T.H. Hart, Exh. 29.\n\nCf. Expert Opinion of D. Frishberg, No. 72: Rejoinder of D. Frishberg, No. 120.\n\n347.\n\nFor some quarters, the Parties\u2019 figures differ to a minimal extent as they disagree on the precise date to be considered for the fixation of the rate applicable to the following quarter. Article 4(1) LA, on which the Parties rely, stipulates that the interest rate shall be \"fixed\" at the last day of the previous quarter or, pursuant to the wording of the modified version adopted in Amendment No. 7, \"adjusted\" at the first business day of the subsequent new quarter or, if this is a non-banking day, at the next banking day. Article 4(2) LA provides for the use of method (a) that the rate published two business days prior to the fixation date is to be used. The Parties are in dispute about the operation of these provisions.\n\n348.\n\nAs the Tribunal-has explained above, the determination of the interest to be awarded on CSOB's claim for damages as from April 10, 1997 is not based on the Loan Agreement. The Tribunal notes that fixation date of the rates quoted by CSOB is closer to the end of the previous quarter. In addition, the rates so determined by CSOB are, taken as an average, lower than the rates quoted by the Slovak Republic. The Tribunal retains the rates provided by CSOB; there is no reason to retain interest rates higher than those invoked in support of CSOB's claim.\n\n349.\n\nTo the Tribunal's knowledge, Czech law does not prohibit an award for compound interest on a damage claim. Full compensation for damage may include such interest if the damage includes claimant's costs of refinancing that imply payments on the basis of compound interest, *e.g.* in case a bank has to refinance an outstanding loan on a shortterm basis. However, CSOB has chosen to claim \"abstract\" lost profit, *i.e.* profit made in transactions similar to the one at issue. In this respect, the Tribunal has not received evidence demonstrating that such transactions would imply compound interest, in full or in part. In particular, it has not been shown convincingly that \"common business practice\" in the Slovak Republic supported capitalization of interest. Under these circumstances, awarding compound interest as part of the compensation for CSOB's damage would amount to pure speculation. Therefore, the Tribunal's interest computation does not retain compound interest.\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal's computation takes account of the repayments made by the FTOs in a total amount of SKK 186,389,159 since April 10, 1997, as evidenced during this proceeding.199\n\nCf. Expert Opinion of T.H. Hart, Exh. 39, amending Exh. 4.\n\n351.\n\nIn respect of the amount of principal and interest of SKK 13,364,616.692 owed to 'CSOB as of April 10, 1997, the accumulation of interest on the basis of the three months BRIBOR, taking into account the repayments (reducing the principal to SKK 13,178,227.533), results in an amount of SKK 11,618,154.309. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that on November 30, 2004, the total amount to be awarded to CSOB is SKK 24,796,381.842.\n\n352.\n\nPursuant to Section 735 Commercial Code, the Tribunal retains the rate of 4%, plus 1%, as applicable to interest running on the principal amount awarded as from the date of payment fixed in the Award, until full payment.\n\nE. Operating Costs and Other Fees\n---------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nCSOB has claimed management fees from SI under the SI Security Agreement for an amount of SKK 20,934,665, representing the management fees for 14 quarters and charged through either the SI current account or the SI current sub-account related to Technopol.\n\n354.\n\nRelying on its accounting expert, the Slovak Republic claims as of December 31, 2002, a reduction of SKK 20,935,976 because CSOB allegedly mismanaged SI and did not perform with the expert care and in accordance with the interests of SI, as required under Section II.3 of the Operation Agreement.200\n\nThe Slovak Republic's Rejoinder, p. 60; the Slovak Republic's Counter Memorial, p. 83; Expert Opinion of D. Frishberg, No. 38-40; Rejoinder of D. Frishberg, No. 75-78.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal will not inquire whether CSOB has managed SI correctly and it will not make any ruling based on the Operation Agreement that is not within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. As a matter of fact, the Tribunal was informed that the SI management, while carried out by CSOB, collected more than SKK 1.7 billion on receivables and negotiated favorable agreements on future collections.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted that the SI Supervisory Board had to supervise SI managers and it actually did so, until the Supervisory Board chose not to hold formal meetings. This Board did not object to the way SI was being managed. The Operation Agreement authorized SI to terminate the Agreement without cause and with six months notice (Section V). SI did not do so until the contract was cancelled in April 1997.\n\n357.\n\nAs the Tribunal has stated above, what matters from the perspective of Article 3(II) CA and the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation is the actual state of SI\u2019s losses in respect of SI\u2019s assets and liabilities. Merely potential claims based on agreements other than the CA are not to be taken into account for the determination of SI\u2019s losses and the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation.\n\n358.\n\nThe Slovak Republic also argues that CSOB has incorrectly charged SKK 14,011,934 maintenance fees and SKK 12,622,267 for foreign bank charges related to its payment of the OBS guarantees, whose creation and payment was insufficiently documented.201 CSOB\u2019s accounting expert has indicated that these maintenance fees were charged for the OBS guarantees independently of whether the guarantees were paid or not, and that the other fees were properly charged as the related guarantees had effectively been paid.202\n\nCf. Rejoinder of D. Frishberg, No. 75-78.\n\nExpert Reply of T.H. Hart, No. 98.\n\n359.\n\nHowever, as the Tribunal has already stated, such alleged deficiencies could not offer any reason to consider that the assignment of the receivables would not have been binding for SI. These assignments had been accepted by SI, with the full knowledge of the Slovak Republic. There is no reason either to refuse payment of the bank costs related to these receivables. This is all what matters under Article 3(II) CA. Therefore, the amounts referred to above are not relevant for the determination of the Slovak Republic's cover losses obligation.\n\nF. Taxes\n--------\n\n360.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has argued that the amount CSOB claims should be reduced because of a \"tax windfall\". In its view, CSOB would have owed taxes on interest income in an amount greater *if* SI had made timely payments on the loan than the respective taxes CSOB would owe today on that portion of the claim, and on the amounts that might be awarded to CSOB.\n\n361.\n\nA first alleged reason for a \"tax windfall\" is the interest capitalization. In the hypothesis of interest capitalization, the capitalized amount would also have been smaller if account is taken of the taxes to be paid on the interest due. However, as indicated above, the Tribunal does not accept such interest capitalization. Consequently, the impact of earlier tax payments on the amount of interest needs not to be examined from this perspective.\n\n362.\n\nA second alleged reason for a \"tax windfall\" is the fact that tax rates in the Slovak Republic were 40% until the year 2000, when they were reduced to 29%. The Slovak Republic has argued that CSOB would obtain a windfall profit when its income out of the award would now be taxed at 29% while the compensation had it been paid on time, would have been taxed at 40%. Consequently, as of December 31, 2002, because of the present tax rate, CSOB would save an amount of SKK 3,403,227.165 (not taking the interest capitalization into account).\n\n363.\n\nThe Slovak Republic has relied on a study in a US accounting journal to sustain that compensation should take into account changes in a tax regime.203 However, it has not submitted any evidence that under Czech law compensation is reduced proportionally when the tax rate has decreased between the moment the compensation became due *(i.e.* in April 1997) and the moment of actual payment.\n\nFisher & Romaine, Janis Joplin\u2019s Yearbook and the Theory of Damages, *Journal of Accounting,* 145, 148 (1990).\n\n364.\n\nThe court decisions submitted by the Slovak Republic are unconvincing. The decisions concerning whether the repair costs to be compensated include VAT or not do not rule that the amount of compensation depends on the later actual impact of income tax rates on the compensation to be received.204\n\nJudgements 3C 258/98-20, District Court in Semily, and 25 Co 558/98-36, Regional Court in Hradee Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9.,\n\n365.\n\nThe decision of the Czech Supreme Court that compensation due for renting a car consists of the renting expenses minus the saved costs of using one\u2019s own car, in other words that the \"actual damage\" is granted, is irrelevant for the issue whether compensation is affected by later changes in an income tax rate.205 The Slovak Republic incorrectly alleges that such reduced income tax rate is an \"advantage brought about by the harmful event\"; on the contrary, there is no link between the harmful event and the rate at which the injured party's compensation is taxed as income.\n\nCzech Supreme Court, 1 Cz 86/90, November 30, 1990.\n\n366.\n\nSimilarly, the decisions from the US-Iran Claims Tribunal to which the Slovak Republic referred are also irrelevant. In one case, the 5.5% tax on contract payments was not included in the compensation, because it did not have to be paid on amounts received as compensation; only on amounts received as contract payments. In another case the fact that the investor was entitled to half of the proceeds after taxes from the compensation due to its joint venture with Guinea, was a mere consequence of the fact that it was the shareholder and not the injured company itself that claimed compensation.\n\n367.\n\nIncome taxes are an act of government (*\"fait du prince \u2019\u2019)* that are out of the parties\u2019 control and are unrelated to the obligation of one party to fully compensate the other party for the harm done. Moreover, they are consequential to the compensation and do not affect its determination. Compensation will not increase or decrease according to whether the amount of income tax rates is increased or decreased. Anyhow, the evidence before the Tribunal does not permit it to make any assessment on CSOB's tax duties, past and present.\n\n368.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Tribunal cannot examine CSOB's objections that, to assess the impact of a difference in tax rate, not the specific amounts due to CSOB under the CA, but CSOB\u2019s complete tax situation and its global year end taxable income -or at least the tax situation and income of CSOB\u2019s Slovak branch - should be considered. The Tribunal does equally not examine CSOB's argument that the interest actually generated by the LA were set \"at cost\" and thus did not generate profit for CSOB and that it allegedly has paid taxes on the amounts due but unpaid till April 1998.\n\n**VII.** The Division of Costs\n------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nCSOB requests that the Slovak Republic be ordered to pay all of CSOB's costs including all the costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, in the total amount of US$ 16,351,846.206\n\nThis amount includes a correction in respect of the advances paid to the Centre.\n\n370.\n\nThe Slovak Republic requests that CSOB be ordered to pay all the Slovak Republic's costs associated with this proceeding, including attorney's fees and expenses, in the total amount of US$ 14,314,236.17.207\n\nThis amount includes a correction in respect of the advances paid to the Centre.\n\n371.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there was not, in the instant case, a situation as argued by the Slovak Republic, where one party only was clearly advocating arguments that compelled the other Party to reply with extensive and unnecessary arguments. Both Parties have argued their case to the best of their knowledge; there is no reason to determine the distribution of costs on the basis of the cost effectiveness of each argument put forward by a Party, all the more so as the statements submitted by the Parties would not allow the identification of the pertinent amounts in such respect. Further, the Tribunal understands that, as a general rule, the party's employee costs are not recoverable to the extent that such costs are part of a party's normal operating expenses and do not represent special costs incurred for the purposes of the arbitration. However, in the instant case, the record shows that CSOB's employees had prepared specific contributions that were caused by this proceeding, including several statements filed with the Tribunal, which justify the request for recovery of the associated costs, not to mention that the same are in an amount of not more than 1.54% of CSOB's total costs.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal takes into account that the Slovak Republic did oppose without success the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction; that the proceedings related to SI\u2019s bankruptcy caused CSOB to request from the Tribunal provisional measures that were granted; and that its objections to the merits in respect of the existence of its cover losses obligation under the CA have been rejected by the Tribunal, whereas CSOB's claim for compensation has been granted in its prevailing part. Therefore, the Tribunal finds appropriate that the Slovak Republic bear its own costs, expenses and counsel fees and that it shall contribute to CSOB\u2019s costs by the amount of US$ 10,000,000. CSOB shall bear its own costs, expenses and counsel fees above this amount of US$ 10,000,000.\n\n373.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal rejects the Slovak Republic's request that it be granted \"any further relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate\". This request lacks any substantiation. Moreover, the Tribunal has no power to provide for any relief on its own initiative.\n\n**VIII.** Decision\n------------------\n\n374.\n\nOn the basis of the reasons given above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows -\n\n1. The Slovak Republic shall pay to Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka A.S. the amount of Slovak Crowns 24,796,381.842.00 as compensation, including principal and interest until November 30, 2004, for Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka's damage.\n\n2. The Slovak Republic shall pay to Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka A.S. on the amount of Slovak Crowns 24,796,381.842.00 interest at a rate of 4.19% between December 1, 2004 and the date of this Award.\n\n3. The amounts awarded under No. 1 and 2 shall be paid by the Slovak Republic to Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka A.S. within 30 days from the date of this Award. Thereafter, the amounts awarded under No. 1 and 2 will accumulate interest at an annual rate of 5%, until paid.\n\n4. The Slovak Republic shall bear its own costs, expenses and counsel fees, including its share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID.\n\n5. The Slovak Republic shall pay to Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka A.S. the amount of US$ 10,000,000 within 30 days from the date of this Award, together with interest running thereafter at an annual rate of 5%, as a contribution to Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka\u2019s costs, expenses and counsel fees, including its share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID. Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodni Banka A.S. shall bear its costs, expenses and counsel fees, including its share of the costs incurred by the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID, in any amount higher than US$ 10,000,000."}]}
