INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimants in this arbitration are Mason Capital L.P. and Mason Management LLC (collectively referred to as \"**Claimants**\"), two companies incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, the United States of America, with their registered office at 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808, U.S.A.\n\n2.\n\nClaimants are represented in these proceedings by Ms. Claudia T. Salomon, Ms. Lilia B. Vazova, Mr. Matthew C. Catalano of Latham & Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, U.S.A., Ms. Sophie J. Lamb QC, Mr. Samuel M. Pape, and Mr. Bryce Williams of Latham & Watkins LLP, 99 Bishopsgate, London EC2M 3XF, United Kingdom, Mr. Wonsuk (Steve) Kang of Latham & Watkins LLP, 29F One IFC, 10 Gukjegeumyung-ro Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul 07326, Republic of Korea, and Mr. Eun Nyung (Ian) Lee and Mr. John M. Kim of KL Partners, 7th Floor, Tower 8, 7 Jongro 5 gil, Jongro-gu 7, Seoul 03157, Republic of Korea.\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Korea (\"**Respondent**\" or \"**Korea**\").\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Paul Friedland, Mr. Sven Volkmer, Mr. Damien Nyer, Ms. Insue Kim of White & Case LLP, 1221 Avenue of the Americas, New York 10020-1095, U.S.A., Mr. Jun Hee Kim, Ms. Sebyul Chun of White & Case LLP, 31F One IFC, 10 Gukjegeumyung-ro, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul 07326, Republic of Korea, Mr. Moon Sung Lee, Mr. Dong Seong Nam, Mr. Robert Wachter, Mr. Kyung Chun Kim, Mr. Sang Hoon Han, Mr. Hee Woong Lee, Ms. Ayong Lim, and Ms. Elizabeth Shin of Lee & Ko, Hanjin Building, 63 Namdaemun-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul 04532, Republic of Korea.\n\n5.\n\nA dispute has arisen between Claimants and Respondent concerning Claimants' investment in Samsung C&T Corporation (\"**SC&T**\") and Samsung Electronics, Inc. (\"**SEC**\"), two publicly listed Korean companies that form part of the Samsung group of companies (\"**Samsung Group**\").1 According to Claimants, Korean government officials improperly and illegally manipulated the SC&T shareholder vote to approve the merger of SC&T with Cheil Industries, Inc. (\"**Cheil**\") at an undervalue to SC&T shareholders. These actions, Claimants argue, amount to violations of the minimum standard of treatment and national treatment standard under the FTA and caused damages to Claimants.2 Respondent denies Claimants' allegations as to the violations of the FTA and damages in their entirety.3\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, 13 September 2018 (the \"**Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim**\"), \u00b6 2.\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 3-6, 64, 74, 81.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, 25 January 2019 (the \"**Memorial**\"), \u00b6 3.\n\n6.\n\nThe merits of such allegations are not the subject for today. This decision addresses certain preliminary matters, namely Respondent's application of 25 January 2019 that the Tribunal dismiss certain of Claimants' claims pursuant to Articles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA on the basis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over them or, alternatively, that, as a matter of law, some of Claimants' claims are not claims for which an award in favour of Claimants may be made under Article 11.26 of the FTA.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of the arbitration and constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 7 June 2018, Claimants served upon the Government of the Republic of Korea a Notice of Intent to bring arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Korea pursuant to Article 11.16.2 of the Free Trade Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America, signed on 30 June 2007 and entered into force on 15 March 2012 (the \"**FTA**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 September 2018, Claimants filed the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim pursuant to Article 3(1) of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law Arbitration Rules, 1976 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\") and Article 11.16.3 of the FTA.\n\n9.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, Claimants appointed The Rt.

Dame Elizabeth Gloster**  \nOne Essex Court  \nTemple  \nLondon EC4Y 9AR  \nUnited Kingdom\n\n10.\n\nIn its Response to Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 12 October 2018, Respondent agreed to the application of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules and appointed Professor Pierre Mayer, a French national, as the second arbitrator. Professor Mayer's contact details are:\n\n**Professor Pierre Mayer**  \n20 Rue des Pyramides  \nParis 75001  \nFrance\n\n11.\n\nOn 11 December 2018, the Parties, pursuant to Article 11.19.1 of the FTA, appointed Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a German national, as the presiding arbitrator. Professor Sachs' contact details are:\n\n**Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs**  \nCMS Hasche Sigle  \nNymphenburger Stra\u00dfe 12  \n80335 Munich  \nGermany\n\n12.\n\nOn 13 December 2018, the Parties agreed to the administration of the proceedings by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\"). The PCA accepted to act as registry on 14 December 2018.\n\n13.\n\nOn 22 December 2018, the PCA, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, circulated drafts of the Terms of Appointment and the Procedural Order No. 1 for the Parties' review and comments.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing an extension request which was granted by the Tribunal, on 1 and 4 February 2019, respectively, the Parties submitted their joint comments on the draft Terms of Appointment and draft Procedural Order 1. In their joint communication of 1 February 2019, the Parties consented to the appointment of Mr. Marcus Weiler as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 19 February 2019, a first procedural meeting was held via telephone conference in which counsel and representatives for both Parties, all members of the Tribunal, the Assistant to the Tribunal, and the PCA participated.\n\n16.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, having considered the Parties' comments, the Tribunal issued its Terms of Appointment, signed by the President of the Tribunal, which, *inter alia*, fixed Singapore as the place of arbitration (legal seat) pursuant to the Parties' agreement, set out rules concerning the language of the arbitration and translations. A final version of the Terms of Appointment signed by all Parties and each member of the Tribunal was circulated on 11 March 2019.\n\n17.\n\nAlso on 25 February 2019, having considered the Parties' comments, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which set out the rules of procedure, including the transparency regime applicable to these proceedings.\n\n**B. Process for determination of Respondent's preliminary objections**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn 18 and 19 January 2019, the Parties jointly submitted a proposed intermediate timetable to the Tribunal, pursuant to which Respondent was to file its preliminary objections under Articles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA together with a proposed procedural timetable for the preliminary objections phase by 25 January 2019 and the Parties were to revert to the Tribunal with an agreed timetable for the preliminary objections or, in case of disagreement, with separate proposed timetables by 12 February 2019. On 21 January 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that the proposed intermediate timetable was acceptable.\n\n19.\n\nFollowing an extension request which was granted by the Tribunal, on 13 February 2019, the Parties reverted to the Tribunal separately with their observations on the appropriate process for determining Respondent's preliminary objections and the procedural calendar.\n\n20.\n\nHaving obtained prior leave, on 15 February 2019, Respondent submitted further observations on Claimants' characterization of certain legal authorities cited in Claimants' submission of 13 February 2019.\n\n21.\n\nDuring the first procedural meeting on 19 February 2019, as recorded in the Tribunal's letter dated 26 February 2019, the Parties and the Tribunal agreed on a tentative schedule for the determination of Respondent's preliminary objections in deviation from the time limits set forth in Article 11.20.7 of the FTA. The tentative schedule was subject to the Parties' subsequent agreement or a decision by the Tribunal to this effect.\n\n22.\n\nOn 28 February and 4 March 2019, Claimants and Respondent, respectively, confirmed their agreement to the timetable set out in the Tribunal's letter of 26 February 2019 and provided further comments on the admissibility of a further separate jurisdictional phase subsequent to the preliminary objections phase.\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 March 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2, which established the procedural calendar for the determination of Respondent's preliminary objections, as agreed by the Parties at the first procedural meeting and confirmed by the Parties' letters of 28 February and 4 March 2019. The Tribunal also reserved its position as to the admissibility of another separate jurisdictional phase until such time as a request for another jurisdictional phase were made.\n\n**C. Written pleadings**\n------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn 25 January 2019, Respondent submitted its Memorial, with supporting evidence and a proposed procedural calendar for the preliminary objections phase.\n\n25.\n\nOn 19 April 2019, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\"), with supporting evidence.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 June 2019, Respondent filed its Reply on Preliminary Objections (the \"**Reply**\"), with supporting evidence.\n\n27.\n\nFurther to a joint request from the Parties, on 30 August 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 in which it adopted a revised procedural calendar.\n\n28.\n\nOn 6 September 2019, pursuant to the revised procedural calendar, Claimants submitted witness statements and expert reports in anticipation of Claimants' Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, excluding accompanying documents. On 11 September 2019, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 26 September 2019, Respondent sought leave to introduce three new Korean legal authorities (Exhibits R-23, R-24 and R-25) into the record. Upon the Tribunal's invitation to comment, Claimants objected to Respondent's request by letter dated 27 September 2019. On 28 September 2019, the Tribunal admitted the legal authorities onto the record.\n\n**D. Hearing on preliminary objections**\n----------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nOn 16 September 2019, each side submitted a final list of fact and expert witnesses it wished to cross-examine at the hearing.\n\n31.\n\nOn 24 September 2019, a pre-hearing conference call was held in which counsel and representatives for the Parties, all members of the Tribunal, the Assistant to the Tribunal and the PCA participated.\n\n32.\n\nThe hearing on Respondent's preliminary objections (the **\"Hearing on Preliminary Objections\"** or the **\"Hearing\"**) was held at the New York International Arbitration Center, 150 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017, U.S.A., from 2 to 4 October 2019.

3**  \n**SAVING OF RULES OF EQUITY AND COMMON LAW**\n\nThe rules of equity and of common law applicable to partnerships as modified by the Partnership Law but excluding sections 31, 45 to 54 and 56 to 57 shall apply to an exempted limited partnership, except where they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Law.\n\n**SECTION 4(2)**   \n**CONSTITUTION**\n\n2) An exempted limited partnership shall consist of one or more persons called general partners who shall, in the event that the assets of the exempted limited partnership are inadequate, be liable for all debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership, and one or more persons called limited partners who shall not be liable for the debts or obligations of the exempted limited partnership save as provided in the partnership agreement and to the extent specified in section 20(1) and 34(1), but a general partner, without derogation from his position as such, may, in addition, take an interest as a limited partner in the exempted limited partnership.\n\n**SECTION 14**  \n**MODIFICATION OF GENERAL LAW**\n\n1) A limited partner shall not take part in the conduct of the business of an exempted limited partnership in its capacity as limited partner.\n\n2) All letters, contracts, deeds, instruments or documents whatsoever shall be entered into by or on behalf of the general partner (or any agent or delegate of the general partner) on behalf of the exempted limited partnership.\n\n**SECTION 16(1), (2)**   \n**PROPERTY**\n\n1) Any rights or property of every description of the exempted limited partnership, including all choses in action and any right to make capital calls and receive the proceeds thereof that is conveyed to or vested in or held on behalf of any one or more of the

partners jointly, upon trust as an asset of the exempted limited partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\n2) Any debt or obligation incurred by a general partner in

limited partner takes part in the conduct of the business of an exempted limited partnership in its dealings with persons who are not partners, that limited partner shall be liable, in the event of the insolvency of the exempted limited partnership, for all debts and obligations of that exempted limited partnership incurred during the period that he participates in the conduct of the business as though he were, for that period, a general partner, but he shall be liable only to a person who transacts business with the exempted limited partnership during the period with actual knowledge of his participation and who then reasonably believed the limited partner to be a general partner.\n\n**SECTION 23**  \n**DIFFERENCES DECIDED BY GENERAL PARTNER**\n\nAny difference arising as to matters connected with the business of the exempted limited partnership shall be decided by the general partner, and, if more than one, by a majority of the general partners as is provided in the partnership agreement.\n\n**SECTION 33**  \n**PROCEEDINGS**\n\n1) Subject to subsection (3), legal proceedings by or against an exempted limited partnership may be instituted by or against any one or more of the

right to join in or otherwise institute proceedings against any one or more of the limited partners who may be liable under section 20(1) or to enforce the return of the contribution, if any, required by section 34(1).\n\n3) A limited partner may bring an action on behalf of an exempted limited partnership if any one or more of the general partners with authority to do so have, without cause, failed or refused to institute proceedings.\n\n4) If any action taken pursuant to subsection (3) is successful, in whole or in part, as a result of a judgment, compromise or settlement of any action, the court may award any limited partner bringing any action reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, from any recovery in any action or from an exempted limited partnership.\n\nExempted Limited Partnership Law, 2014 of the Cayman Islands [**CLA-22**].\n\n43.\n\nThe relationship between the General Partner and the Limited Partner is further governed by the Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement dated 1 January 2013 (the \"**Partnership Agreement**\").14 The Parties have made submissions, *inter alia,* on the following provisions of the Partnership

The General Partner shall have the power by itself on behalf and in the name of the Partnership to carry out any and all of the objects and purposes of the Partnership set forth in Section 1.05, and to perform all acts and enter into and perform all contracts and other undertakings which it may deem necessary or advisable or incidental thereto, and to have and possess the same rights and powers as any general partner in a partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands, including, without limitation, to:\n\nn) commence or defend any litigation or arbitration involving the Partnership or the General Partner in its capacity as General Partner\u2026\n\n3.06 Exculpation. The General Partner (and its members, employees, agents and affiliates) (each, a \"Covered Person\") shall not be liable to any other Partner or the Partnership for any loss suffered by the Partnership unless such loss is caused by such Covered Person's Gross Negligence, willful misconduct or breach of fiduciary duty. A Covered Person may consult with counsel and accountants in respect of Partnership affairs and, in acting in accordance with the written advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants, such Covered Person shall not be liable for any loss suffered by the Partnership provided that such counsel or accountants shall have been selected with reasonable care and the written advice was not induced by such Covered Person's Gross Negligence or willful misconduct. Covered Persons shall not be liable for errors in judgment or for any acts or omissions that do not constitute Gross Negligence, willful misconduct or breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n3.07 Indemnification.\n\na) A Covered Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all losses, liabilities and expenses (collectively, \"Losses\") arising from claims, demands, investigations, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal or administrative (each, a \"Proceeding\"), in which it (and its members, employees and agents) may be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of the management of the affairs of the Partnership, whether or not it continues to be such at the time any such Loss is paid or incurred. A Covered Person shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any conduct arising from its Gross Negligence, willful misconduct, breach of its fiduciary duty or breach of this Agreement in connection with its management of the Partnership's affairs\u2026\n\n**ARTICLE 4**  \n**CAPITAL ACCOUNTS**\n\n4.01 Capital Contributions. Each Partner shall make an initial Capital Contribution in cash or in kind, with the consent of the General Partner. Limited Partners shall also make an initial Capital Contribution that is attributable to each series or sub-series of shares issued by such Limited Partner for the benefit of the shareholder(s) of such series or sub-series. The initial Capital Contribution by a Limited Partner shall not be less than $1,000,000 for Partners admitted on or after the effective date of this Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, except to the extent the General Partner, at its sole discretion, permits an initial Capital Contribution in a lesser amount.\n\n4.03 Capital Account.

Claimants' alleged investments in SC&T and SEC**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn or around February 2014, Claimants began an analysis of whether to invest in the Korean technology sector.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of Respondent's preliminary objections**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nRespondent raises two preliminary objections pursuant to Articles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA,48 which, according to Respondent, would materially reduce the subsequent phase of the proceedings if they were successful.49\n\nWhile Respondent's counsel has referred to three preliminary objections in his opening statement at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections (Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 7:7-8), Respondent has only mentioned two preliminary objections in its Memorial, \u00b6 2. Depending on whether Respondent's two arguments regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the General Partner's claim are counted as separate objections, there are two or three preliminary objections. For the purposes of this Decision, the Tribunal will assume that there is one preliminary objection under Article 11.20.7 of the FTA, consisting of two main arguments, and one preliminary objection under Article 11.20.6 of the FTA.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 2.\n\n65.\n\nFirst, Respondent raises an objection to the Tribunal's competence under Article 11.20.7 of the FTA. It argues that the General Partner's claim fails at the jurisdictional level for two reasons, namely (i) because the General Partner does not qualify as an \"investor\" since it did not \"make\" an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 11.28 of the FTA and did not own or control the Samsung Shares under Korean law;50 and (ii) because under the FTA as well as international law, the General Partner lacks standing to bring a claim on behalf of the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner as third-party beneficiaries.51\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 5; Reply, \u00b6 54.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 5.\n\n66.\n\nSecond, Respondent files an objection under Article 11.20.6 of the FTA submitting that the General Partner's claim is \"legally deficient\" and, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favour of the General Partner may be made because the General Partner did not incur the alleged damages and cannot claim damages for the benefit of the Cayman Fund.52\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n67.\n\nAs to Claimants' objection to the appropriateness of the preliminary phase of the proceedings, Respondent submits that the determination of its objections does not require an inquiry into the \"full factual record\".53\n\nReply, \u00b6 120.\n\n**B. Respondent's request for relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIn the Memorial, Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\na. Declare that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims brought by the GP\n\nand dismiss all the claims brought by the GP on the basis that:\n\ni) the GP cannot bring claims on behalf of the Cayman Fund under the FTA, and/or\n\nii) the GP does not qualify as an investor under Article 11.28 of the FTA.\n\nb. In the alternative, declare that the GP's claim is, as a matter of law, not a claim\n\nfor which an award in favor of the GP may be made, and dismiss the GP's claims accordingly; and\n\nc. Order any other relief the Tribunal deems appropriate.54\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 37.\n\n69.\n\nIn the Reply, Respondent amends its request for relief and now requests that the Tribunal:\n\na. Declare that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the GP's claims on the basis that: the GP has not made an investment in accordance with Article 11.28 of the FTA; and/or the GP did not own or control the Samsung Shares, and, accordingly, dismiss all of the claims brought by the GP;\n\nb. In the alternative:\n\ni) Dismiss the GP's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that: the GP lacks standing to submit claims on behalf of third parties under Article 11.16.1; and/or the GP's claim in respect of such portion is, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favor of the GP may be made under Article 11.20.6; and\n\nii) Declare that the GP can claim damages only to the extent of its own Partnership Interest in 2015;\n\nc. Order Claimants to bear in full the costs of this preliminary phase of the arbitration and all of Korea's costs of legal representation and other expenses; and\n\nd. Order any other relief the Tribunal deems appropriate.55\n\nReply, \u00b6 121.\n\n**C. Summary of Claimants' position on Respondent's preliminary objections**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's preliminary objections in their entirety.\n\n71.\n\nAs to Respondent's first preliminary objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, Claimants submit i) that the General Partner is an \"investor\" and the Samsung Shares are an \"investment\" within the meaning of the FTA, and (ii) that there is no standing requirement under the FTA or international law and even if there were, the General Partner would satisfy that requirement.56\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 61.\n\n72.\n\nIn relation to Respondent's preliminary objection that, as a matter of law, the General Partner's claim is not a claim for which an award in its favour may be made, Claimants submit that Respondent has not come close to discharging its burden of proof that that an award of damages in favour of the General Partner is demonstrably doomed to fail. Claimants contend that Respondent's \"legal deficiency\" objection is premised on a misunderstanding of the role of the General Partner and its proprietary rights regarding the Samsung Shares.57\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 93-94.\n\n73.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants maintain their objection, raised in their letter of 13 February 2019, that the objections raised by Respondent in its Memorial are not appropriate for preliminary determination and should not have been raised in this process.58\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127.\n\n**D.

KEY LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Free Trade Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America was signed on 30 June 2007, entered into force on 15 March 2012.61\n\nThe FTA [**CLA-23**].\n\n77.\n\nArticles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA deal with preliminary objections by respondents:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.20**  \n**CONDUCT OF THE ARBITRATION**\n\n6. Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 11.26.\n\na) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment.\n\nb) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.\n\nc) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.\n\nd) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 7.\n\n7. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days of the date\n\nthe tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 6 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.\n\n78.\n\nArticle 11.16 of the FTA governs the submission of a claim to arbitration:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.16**  \n**SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM TO ARBITRATION**\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\na) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\ni) that the respondent has breached\n\nA) an obligation under Section A,\n\nB) an investment authorization, or\n\nC) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\nii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and\n\nb) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\ni) that the respondent has breached\n\nA) an obligation under Section A,\n\nB) an investment authorization, or\n\nC) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\nii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\n\n\u2026\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n79.\n\nArticle 11.28 of the FTA defines the terms \"enterprise of a Party\", \"investment\" and \"investor of a Party\":\n\n**ARTICLE 11.28**  \n**DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter\n\n\u2026\n\n**enterprise of a Party** means an enterprise constituted or organized under the law of a Party, and a branch located in the territory of a Party and carrying out business activities there.\n\n\u2026\n\n**investment** means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\n\nForms that an investment may take include:\n\na) \u2026\n\nb) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;\n\nc) \u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n**investor of a Party** means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of the other Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n80.\n\nArticle 1.4 of the FTA defines the terms \"enterprise of a Party\" and \"national\":\n\n**ARTICLE 1.4**  \n**DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified:\n\n**enterprise of a Party** means an enterprise constituted or organized under a Party's law\n\n**national** means:\n\na) with respect to Korea, a Korean national within the meaning of the *Nationality Act* ; and\n\nb) with respect to the United States, \"national of the United States\" as defined in the *Immigration and Nationality Act*.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n--------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties during the preliminary phase of these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n82.\n\nBefore turning to its analysis of Respondent's preliminary objections, the Tribunal points out that, as Respondent's counsel stated in his opening statement at the Hearing,62 these objections proceed from two core propositions, namely that: (i) under the FTA and international law, a claimant cannot bring a claim to the extent that another entity beneficially owns the assets in question; and (ii) as a matter of fact, the General Partner has failed to establish its beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, pp. 7:7-17, 9:11-15 [Respondent's Opening Statement].\n\n83.\n\nSeveral of Respondent's arguments under different provisions of the FTA are premised upon these two core propositions. The Tribunal will deal with these propositions in detail in the context of Respondent's argument on legal and beneficial ownership and, where relevant, refer to these propositions in its assessment of Respondent's other arguments.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections is delivered as part of the expedited procedure for the determination of preliminary objections set out in Articles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA. In this context, it is relevant to note that Claimants contend that it is not appropriate for the Tribunal to determine the Respondent's objections as a preliminary issue and have requested a declaration that the General Partner's claim is admissible and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over it. The Tribunal will deal with these points as a preliminary issue before turning to the substance of Respondent's objections.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning is therefore structured as follows: it will first deal with Claimants' objection and request for a declaration of jurisdiction and admissibility (**A.**); thereafter, the Tribunal will address Respondent's two preliminary objections, which relate to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim (**B.**) and the legal deficiency of that claim (**C.**); finally, the Tribunal will deal with the Parties' respective requests to order the opposing Party to bear the costs of this preliminary phase (**D.**).\n\n**A. Claimants' objection to the expedited procedure and request for a declaration of jurisdiction and admissibility of the General Partner's claim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nAs a preliminary issue, the Tribunal addresses Claimants' objection63 to the appropriateness of the preliminary determination of Respondent's objections and Claimants' request64 for a declaration that the General Partner's claim is admissible and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over that claim.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107, referring to Claimants' letter to the Tribunal, 13 February 2019; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 108; Rejoinder, \u00b6 128.\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn their letter of 13 February 2019, Claimants argued that Respondent's objections raised in its Memorial are not appropriate for expedited determination and do not fall within the scope contemplated by the expedited procedure under the FTA as they raise complex factual and legal issues necessitating a detailed factual inquiry and the assessment of expert evidence and questions of foreign municipal law. Furthermore, Claimants took issue with Respondent's reservation of its right to bring further objections at a later stage of the proceedings. In their letter, Claimants requested the Tribunal to join Respondent's objections to a full jurisdictional phase.\n\n88.\n\nIn their Counter-Memorial, Claimants add that \"the Tribunal's examination of the question of damages risks prejudging the merits of the General Partner's claim without access to the full factual record, and without giving the General Partner a 'full opportunity' to present its case, as it is entitled under the UNCITRAL Rules.\"65 As part of their request for relief, Claimants request the Tribunal to declare that the General Partner's claim is admissible and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over that claim.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 106.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 108.\n\n**2. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn its Memorial, Respondent \"reserves its rights to amend and supplement this Memorial, including to request other relief and raise additional jurisdictional objections to either or both Claimants' claims, as [Respondent] may consider necessary or appropriate to enforce or defend its rights\" (emphasis added).67\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 38.\n\n90.\n\nIn its Reply, Respondent argues that the question of whether and to what extent the General Partner holds a beneficial interest in the alleged investments does not require an inquiry into the \"full factual record\" but only requires evidence of the amounts allocated in the capital accounts of the General Partner and the Limited Partner at the relevant times.68\n\nReply, \u00b6 120.\n\n**3. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal decided to \"rule on the admissibility of another separate jurisdictional phase if and when a request for such phase is made\" and explained that \"[n]either the FTA nor the UNCITRAL Rules appears to entitle it to declare further jurisdictional phases inadmissible before an actual request for such phase is made.\" For that reason, the Tribunal rejected Claimants' request to join Respondent's objections to a full jurisdictional phase.\n\n92.\n\nTo the extent that Claimants maintain their objection to the appropriateness of the preliminary determination of Respondent's objections,69 the Tribunal points out that, under Article 11.20.7 of the FTA, it is required to decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 6 and any objection that the dispute is not within the Tribunal's competence. The FTA therefore does not grant the Tribunal any discretionary power whether or not to hear such objections on an expedited basis.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107, referring to Claimants' letter to the Tribunal, 13 February 2019; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127.\n\n93.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, both preliminary objections raised by Respondent fall within the ambit of the expedited procedure under Articles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA. Respondent's first objection relates to the Tribunal's competence over the General Partner's claim in the context of Article 11.20.7 of the FTA. Its second objection that the General Partner's claim is, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favour of the General Partner may be made falls within the scope of Article 11.20.6 of the FTA.\n\n94.\n\nThe final point in relation to Claimants' objection is that whether the substantive threshold under Articles 11.20.6 and 11.20.7 of the FTA is met is a different question which does not relate to the admissibility of the expedited procedure. The Tribunal might well come to the conclusion that, based on the current evidence before it, it is unable to accept a preliminary objection at this stage of the proceedings. The Tribunal will deal with that question in the context of its analysis of Respondent's two preliminary objections.\n\n95.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants' objection to the appropriateness of the preliminary determination of Respondent's objections is not well-founded.\n\n96.\n\nAs to Claimants' request for declaratory relief, the Tribunal notes that Article 11.20.6(d) of the FTA expressly provides that the respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise a preliminary objection or make use of the expedited procedure set out in Article 11.20.7 of the FTA.\n\n97.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, a declaration made now to the effect that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim would be irreconcilable with Article 11.20.6(d) of the FTA as it would curtail Respondent's right under that provision to raise other jurisdictional objections that are not preliminary objections or fall outside the scope of the expedited procedure under Article 11.20.7 of the FTA.\n\n98.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal is not prepared to declare the General Partner's claim admissible and to assume jurisdiction over that claim at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n99.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal rejects Claimants' application for a declaration at this stage of the proceedings that the General Partner's claim is admissible and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over that claim.\n\n**B. Respondent's preliminary objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nRespondent's preliminary objection under Article 11.20.7 of the FTA that the General Partner's claim is not within the Tribunal's competence is based on two arguments, namely: (i) that the General Partner does not qualify as an investor that has made an investment; and (ii) that the General Partner lacks standing to bring a claim on behalf of the Cayman Fund.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent has amended its request for relief and presented its requests for a new order in its Reply.70 Respondent's principal request to dismiss all of the General Partner's claims is premised on Respondent's first argument that the General Partner does not qualify as an investor that has made an investment. Its alternative request to dismiss the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner and to declare that the General Partner can claim damages only to the extent of its own Partnership Interest in 2015 rests upon Respondent's second jurisdictional argument that the General Partner lacks standing to bring a claim on behalf of the Cayman Fund.\n\nReply, \u00b6 121.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of Respondent's preliminary objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the General Partner's claims will be structured as follows: the Tribunal will first deal with Respondent's principal request to dismiss all of the General Partner's claims and in this context will address the argument that the General Partner does not qualify as an investor that has made an investment under the FTA (**1.**); it will then turn to Respondent's alternative request based upon the argument that the General Partner lacks standing under the FTA to bring a claim on behalf of the Cayman Fund (**2.**).\n\n**1.

Therefore, Respondent concludes that the General Partner did not make a contribution, let alone a substantial one, of its \"own financial means and at its own financial risk\" that would qualify as an investment.80 To the extent Claimants assert that the General Partner contributed \"other resources\", Respondent contends that Claimants' argument centres on pre-investment activity that cannot satisfy Article 11.28 of the FTA.81 Respondent further argues that, in any event, Claimants failed to present evidence to show that such pre-investment activity was performed by the General Partner as opposed to another Mason entity,82 and that it follows from the above that the General Partner did not \"make\" an investment, as it did not engage in an \"active contribution\" or \"action of investing\", but merely tried to \"piggyback on contributions made by others (including the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner).\"83\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 26, referring to *Caratube v.

In this regard, Claimants submit that the Samsung Shares comply with this requirement because the General Partner (i) had direct control over the Samsung Shares; (ii) had indirect control over the Samsung Shares, through its supervision of the Investment Manager; and (iii) directly owned the Samsung Shares.107\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 25-28.\n\n117.\n\nWith respect to direct and indirect control, Claimants contend that the General Partner controlled the Samsung Shares \"*de jure*\" and \"*de facto\"* by virtue of its complete and exclusive power over these shares.\"108 Claimants assert that the General Partner's direct control is further evidenced by the fact that, under Cayman law, the General Partner was the only entity allowed to exercise any rights related to business and the assets and to engage in conduct of the business, including having the ultimate say over the Samsung Shares' acquisition, exercising the power to vote at shareholder meetings, receiving dividends, and engaging in advocacy as a shareholder.109 Moreover, Claimants argue that the General Partner supervised the Investment Manager when the latter acted with respect to the Samsung Shares.110 The Limited Partner, in contrast, was legally prohibited from any involvement in the decision-making process.111\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, referring to First ER Lindsay [**CER-1**], \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 22-26; Partnership Law [**CLA-22**], \u00a7\u00a7 14, 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 31, referring to First WS Satzinger [**CWS-2**], \u00b6 8; First WS Garschina [**CWS-1**], \u00b6 6.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 33.\n\n118.\n\nRegarding direct ownership, Claimants argue that the General Partner \"exclusively held ownership rights and obligations in the Shares.\"112 In particular, Claimants submit that the General Partner had direct legal ownership of the Samsung Shares as, under Cayman law, the \"partnership\" is not an entity and cannot own property.113 According to Claimants, all property is owned by the General Partner.114\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 35.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 36.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 36, referring to First ER Lindsay [**CER-1**], \u00b6 23(a); Partnership Law [**CLA-22**], \u00a7 16(1).\n\n119.\n\nClaimants submit that Korean law plays no role in determining the General Partner's ownership or control of the Samsung Shares.115 First, Claimants argue that the FTA protects direct as well as indirect investors. Even if the Tribunal were to assume that the Cayman Fund directly owned the Samsung Shares under Korean law, the General Partner would nevertheless have owned and controlled the Samsung Shares for the purposes of the FTA, because the General Partner owned and controlled the Cayman Fund and, consequently, qualifies as indirect investor.116 Second, Claimants contend that, under Korean private international law, the legal capacity of a foreign organization is determined by reference to that organization's personal foreign law, which in this case is the law of the Cayman Islands.117 Under Cayman law, the Cayman Fund does not exist as an entity separate from the General Partner and the Limited Partner.118 It, according to Claimants, thus lacks capacity under both Cayman and Korean law.119\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 92.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 93.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 95 referring to Legal Opinion of Jae Yeol Kwon, 6 September 2019 (\"**Kwon Opinion**\") [**CER-3**], \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 95, referring to Reynolds Opinion [**RER-1**], \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 95.\n\n120.\n\nWith respect to any alleged registration requirement, Claimants argue that the investment registration does not preclude the General Partner's claim under the FTA, pointing out that in case of registration of a foreign fund, the investment registration may be made in the name of such fund, even if the fund does not have separate legal capacity.120 Even assuming that there were errors during the registration process, these would have \"no effect on ownership of [the Samsung Shares]\"121 as mistakes in the process of making an investment deprive investors of treaty protection only in \"rare circumstances\".122 According to Claimants, Respondent also failed to prove that the purported registration error estops the General Partner from arguing that it is within the FTA's jurisdiction.123\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 117, referring to Kwon Opinion [**CER-3**], \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119, referring to Kwon Opinion [**CER-3**], \u00b6 55.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 119, fn. 137, citing *Mytilineos Holdings SA v.

First, the General Partner acted in its own name and capacity when it brought the claim, as the Cayman Fund does not have its own legal personality and no separate existence from the General Partner and the Limited Partner.157 Second, contrary to Respondent's submission, the Limited Partner is not the investor, as it only provided capital to add to the investment that the General Partner owned and controlled, and otherwise played no role in the investment.158 Third, the General Partner did not act as a mere trustee because, in an exempted limited partnership, the General Partner controls the actions of the Partnership and the Limited Partner acts only as a source of funds for the General Partner.159\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 28-31 referring to First ER Lindsay, \u00b6 15 [**CER-1**]; Reynolds Opinion [**RER-1**], \u00b6 24; Second ER Lindsay [**CER-2**], \u00b6\u00b6 5, 17-19; *Impreglio S.p.A. v.

While this is a question arising under international law, the Tribunal cannot decide this question in isolation from the relevant provisions of municipal law.\n\n*(i) Applicable law*\n--------------------\n\n135.\n\nWith regard to the regulation of corporate relationships, the tribunal in *Perenco v. Ecuador* held that \"[g]iven the absence of detailed general or conventional rules of international law governing the organisation, operation, management and control of an enterprise, a tribunal should in principle be guided by the more detailed prescriptions of the applicable municipal law.\"160 In the Tribunal's view, this principle equally applies to ownership of tangible and intangible property.161 Neither the FTA nor general international law provide for any specific rules on the ownership of shares in a company.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd. V. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, 12 September 2014 *(\"**Perenco v. Ecuador**\")*  **[CLA-37]**, \u00b6 522, referring to *Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, \u00b6 38.\n\nSee also Zachary Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (CUP 2009) [**CLA-39**], \u00b6\u00b6 101-102, providing that \"[i]nvestment disputes are about investments, investments are about property, and property is about specific rights over tangibles and intangibles cognisable by the municipal law of the host state. General international law contains no substantive rules of property law. Nor do investment treaties purport to lay down rules for acquiring rights in rem over tangibles and intangibles. Whenever there is a dispute about the scope of the property rights comprising the investment, or to whom such rights belong, there must be a reference to a municipal law of property\" (footnotes omitted).\n\n136.\n\nWhen a tribunal turns to municipal law to ascertain the owner of assets in a cross-border transaction, the exercise will regularly involve a consideration of the conflict-of-law rules under municipal law to determine the substantive law governing the existence and scope of ownership rights. In assessing whether a foreign organization has become the owner of shares under municipal law, two distinct questions of private international law arise: (i) which law governs the existence and scope of ownership rights of shares in a company; and (ii) which law decides the question of whether a foreign organization has the legal capacity to acquire and hold such rights?\n\n137.\n\nAs regards the first question, Respondent argues that \"[t]he appropriate choice of law for determining the existence or scope of property rights is the municipal law of the property or, in case of shares in a corporation, the law of the place of incorporation of the corporation.\"162 Claimants do not dispute this.163 The Tribunal notes that Respondent's position is based on the widely accepted *lex situs* rule \"which is universally applied by municipal courts\" and \"the appropriate choice of law rule for determining the existence or scope of property rights that comprise an investment.\"164 Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that Korean law governs the existence and effects of ownership rights in the Samsung Shares.\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\nSee Rejoinder, \u00b6 95, which deals exclusively with the legal capacity of a foreign organization under Korean private international law.\n\nZachary Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (CUP 2009) [**CLA-39**], \u00b6 87. This also seems to follow from Article 19(1) of the Korean Act on Private International Law which the Parties have only submitted in Korean [**CLA-54]** but which, according to the English translation available on the website of the Korean Ministry of Government Legislation (http://www.moleg.go.kr/english/korLawEng?pstSeq=52687, last updated 4 November 2019), provides: \"Real rights, or other rights subject to registration, concerning movables and immovables shall be governed by the lex situs of the subject matter.\"\n\n138.\n\nThe Parties' main disagreement relates to the second question, namely the law applicable to determine the legal capacity of the Cayman Fund. Claimants contend that this question is governed by Cayman law as Korea's private international law refers to the personal foreign law of a foreign organization to determine its legal capacity.165 Respondent, on the other hand, contends that this issue is also governed by the municipal law of the property or, in the case of shares in a corporation, the law of the place of incorporation of that company, i.e. Korean law.166\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 95.\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\n139.\n\nArticle 16 of the Korean Act on Private International Law (the \"**Private International Law Act**\") provides that \"[c]orporations and other organizations shall be governed by the applicable law of the establishment thereof: in case corporations or other organizations established in foreign countries have their principal business offices located in the Republic of Korea or transact their principal business in the Republic of Korea, such corporations and other organizations shall be governed by the law of the Republic of Korea.\"167\n\nPrivate International Law Act **[CLA-54]**.\n\n140.\n\nProfessor Rho and Professor Kwon, the two legal experts who gave expert testimony on Korean law, agree on three issues as regards the legal capacity of foreign organizations under Korean law: first, the experts are in agreement that Article 16 of the Private International Law Act sets out a general principle in relation to the legal capacity of a foreign organization that could, in theory, be deviated from in special statutes;168 second, they concur that some Korean statutes apply to foreign organizations even if they otherwise lack legal capacity under Korean law or under the law of the place of their establishment;169 third, the experts agree that a person or organization that does not have the legal capacity to hold rights, either by way of the general provision or a specific statute of Korean law, cannot own shares under Korean law.170\n\nKwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23; Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 357:23-358:5 [Cross-examination of Professor Rho].\n\nKwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6 23; Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 340:22-342:15 [Presentation of Professor Rho].\n\nRho Opinion **[RER-2]**, \u00b6 17; Kwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6 17.\n\n141.\n\nThe experts' disagreement centres on the question whether in the present case there are any special statutes that derogate from the general principle set out in Article 16 of the Private International Law Act and instead provide that a foreign organization lacking legal capacity under the law of its place of establishment can still acquire ownership of shares under Korean law.\n\n142.\n\nIn Professor Rho's view, Article 168.1 of the Korean Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act (the \"**Capital Markets Act**\") is one of these special statutes (which he calls \"Alien Law statutes\") that regulate international issues and derogate from the \"General Legal Capacity\" set out in Article 16 of the Private International Law Act.171 Professor Rho concludes that \"[e]ven where a foreign entity does not have a General Legal Capacity pursuant to the law of its place of establishment, such entity can be bestowed with legal capacity to the extent that such entity is subject to the Capital Markets Act.\"172\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 343:12-15 [Presentation of Professor Rho].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 345:13-17 [Presentation of Professor Rho].\n\n143.\n\nIn Professor Kwon's opinion, Article 168.1 of the Capital Markets Act does not displace the general principle laid down in Article 16 of the Private International Law Act. In his view, Article 168.1 only serves to place limits on acquisitions of listed securities by foreign corporations but does not permit foreign organizations lacking legal capacity under the law of its place of establishment to acquire listed securities.173\n\nKwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis by looking at the wording of Article 168.1 of the Capital Markets Act. The provision bears the heading \"Restrictions on Foreigners' Trading of Securities and Exchange-Traded Derivatives\" and stipulates that \"[w]ith respect to trading and other transactions involving securities or exchange-traded derivatives by foreigners (referring to individuals with no address or residence for not less than six months in the Republic of Korea; hereafter the same shall apply in this Article), foreign corporations, etc., restrictions may be placed on the limit of acquisition, etc. in accordance with the guidelines and methods prescribed by Presidential Decree\" (emphasis added).174\n\nCapital Markets Act **[R-14]**.\n\n145.\n\nArticle 9.16 of the Capital Markets Act and Article 13.2.1 of the Enforcement Decree to the Capital Markets Act define the term \"foreign corporations, etc.\" as including, *inter alia,* a \"foreign company established pursuant to statutes of a foreign country\"175 and a \"fund or an association created and supervised or managed in accordance with the statutes of a foreign country\".176\n\nCapital Markets Act **[R-14]**, Article 9.16.4.\n\nEnforcement Decree to the Capital Markets Act **[R-16]**, Article 13.2.1.\n\n146.\n\nThe experts are again in agreement that a foreign organization which lacks legal capacity under the law of the place of its establishment falls within the definition of \"foreign corporations, etc.\" and the ambit of the Capital Markets Act.177\n\nRho Opinion **[RER-2]**, \u00b6 19; Kwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6 28.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that there could in theory be statutory provisions under Korean law pursuant to which foreign organizations lacking legal capacity at the place of their establishment are deemed to be legally capable for the purposes of that specific act, thereby overriding the general principle set out in Article 16 of the Private International Law Act. Essentially, this is a question of *lex specialis derogat legi generali.*\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, is not convinced that Article 168.1 of the Capital Markets Act constitutes such a special statute that overrides the general principle. The provision's scope of application is clearly defined by its express terms: it allows *restrictions* to be placed on the limit of acquisition of listed securities by way of presidential decree. Nowhere does it state that it seeks to *expand* the list of buyers entitled to acquire property, including listed securities, under Korean law. By contrast to other statutory provisions (such as Article 57 of the Korean Civil Procedure Act178), there is no express provision in the Capital Markets Act dealing with the issue of legal capacity of foreign organizations.179 The Tribunal thus concludes that the Capital Markets Act does not regulate the legal capacity of a foreign organization to acquire shares in Korean companies.\n\nKorean Civil Procedure Act **[R-20]**, providing that \"[w]here a foreigner has a litigation capacity under the laws of the Republic of Korea, he/she shall be deemed to have a litigation capacity, even where he/she does not have such capacity pursuant to the laws of his/her home country.\"\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 387:9-16 [Cross-examination of Professor Rho], pp. 421:17-422:2 [Cross-examination of Professor Kwon].\n\n149.\n\nTo the extent that Professor Rho has relied in his testimony on other Korean statutory provisions, e.g. in the Civil Procedure Act180 or the Corporate Tax Act181, neither these provisions nor the respective jurisprudence of the Korean courts permit the acquisition of shares by foreign funds that lack legal personality at the place of their establishment. In the Tribunal's view, these statutes deal with specific, narrowly confined issues different from the present one and do not displace the general principle set out in Article 16 of the Private International Law Act.\n\nSee fn. 178.\n\nArticle 2.3 of the Korean Corporate Tax Act **[CLA-56]** provides: \"The term 'foreign corporation' means an organization that has its headquarters or main office in a foreign country in the form of a corporation that meets the standards prescribed by Presidential Decree (limited to such a corporation that does not have a place for actual management of its business in the Republic of Korea).\" Article 13.1 of the Korean Framework Act on National Taxes **[CLA-57]** provides: \"Any incorporate body, foundation or other organization (hereinafter referred to as 'organization other than juristic person') which is not a juristic person (referring to domestic and foreign corporations under subparagraph 1 and 3 of Article 1 of the Corporate Tax Act; hereinafter the same shall apply), which falls under any of the following subparagraphs and does not distribute profits to its members, shall be deemed a juristic person and governed by this Act and other tax-related Acts\".\n\n150.\n\nAs a final remark on the applicable law, the Tribunal notes that subjecting the legal capacity of a foreign organization to hold property rights to the *lex situs* of the property would result in a legal nullity becoming the owner of the property. Both at the national and international level, this would be an undesirable result as it would create considerable uncertainty as to who can exercise the ownership rights in these assets.\n\n*(ii) Legal ownership*\n----------------------\n\n151.\n\nHaving established that Korean law governs the existence and scope of ownership rights in the Samsung Shares whereas Cayman law governs the Cayman Fund's legal capacity to acquire and hold rights, the Tribunal now turns to the application of these substantive laws to the present dispute.\n\n152.\n\nRespondent argues that for a foreign investor to be recognized as an owner of shares in a Korean company, the investor must register as a foreign investor, acquire shares in its own name and register as a shareholder in the shareholder registry.182 In support of its argument, Respondent relies on Professor Rho's legal opinion according to which \"[t]he [Korean] Supreme Court has regarded the ownership of shares as an issue of determining the party to a share subscription agreement for new shares or share purchase agreement for existing shares.\"183\n\nReply, \u00b6 57, referring to Rho Opinion **[RER-2]**, \u00a7 V.\n\nRho Opinion **[RER-2]**, \u00b6 28, citing Supreme Court Decision Case No. 2016Da265351, 5 December 2017 [**R-12**].\n\n153.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Cayman Fund was registered as foreign investor with the Financial Supervisory Service184 and as shareholder on the shareholder registries of SEC and SC&T.185\n\nCayman Fund's Application for Foreign Investment Registration, 23 June 2014 **[R-7]**.\n\nSamsung C&T Corporation Register of Shareholders, 11 June 2015 **[R-8]** ; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. Register of Shareholders, 30 June 2015 **[R-9]**.\n\n154.\n\nThis leads Respondent to conclude that the Cayman Fund became the legal owner of the Samsung Shares under Korean law as only the Cayman Fund established a shareholder relationship with SC&T and SEC, and that any trust arrangement under Cayman law and the Partnership Agreement would be external to that relationship.186\n\nReply, \u00b6 60.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with that conclusion. Assuming the Samsung Shares were indeed purchased in the name of the Cayman Fund,187 the legal consequences of that acquisition in the name of the Cayman Fund are governed by the same law that applies to the Fund's legal capacity to hold rights. Therefore, Cayman law, as the law at the place of the Fund's establishment, determines who becomes the legal owner of shares purchased in the name of the Fund.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while the experts agree that under the Korean Commercial Act, existing shares are transferred by agreement of the seller and purchaser and delivery of the relevant share certificates (Kwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6 46; Rho Opinion **[RER-2]**, \u00b6\u00b6 16; 31-32), no such share purchase agreements that might indicate the identity of the contracting parties have been produced.\n\n156.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties188 or the legal experts on Cayman law, Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds,189 that, under Cayman law, the Cayman Fund lacks legal personality and the capacity to hold property and that the General Partner owns all partnership assets on trust for the Cayman Fund.\n\nReply, \u00b6 60, fn. 134; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 36.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 231:8-24; 234:7-20 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\n157.\n\nUnder Article 16.1 of the Partnership Law, \"[a]ny rights or property of every description of the exempted limited partnership \u2026 shall be held or deemed to be held by the general partner \u2026 upon trust as an asset of the exempted limited partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement\" (emphasis added).190\n\nPartnership Law **[CLA-22]**, \u00a7 16(1).\n\n158.\n\nMr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds concur that by using the words \"deemed to be held\", the Partnership Law clarifies that the general partner will be the legal owner of the partnership's assets regardless of whether the partnership is named as the owner.191 As Ms. Reynolds has explained, \"the reason for that [provision] is because sometimes in parts of the world or in other context, the Partnership will be named as the owner\".192 The present case falls squarely within that scope of application.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 329:16-330:10 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 329:18-20 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, even if the Samsung Shares were acquired in the name of the Cayman Fund, they were legally owned by the General Partner. This follows from the reference of Korea's private international law to Cayman law as the law governing the Fund's legal capacity, and Cayman law accepting this reference.193\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of Ms. Reynold's caveat that \"Cayman Law would defer to the Law of Incorporation to determine who owns shares. So, if we're talking about Korean shares, then we would refer to the law of Korea as to who owns them.\" (Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 232:13-16; see also p. 330:11-14). In the Tribunal's view, it is irrelevant whether Cayman law defers to the *lex situs* for general ownership of the assets. Rather, the question at issue is whether Cayman law accepts the reference of foreign conflict-of-law rules to determine the legal capacity of an exempted limited partnership. The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Lindsay that \"if the analysis [under foreign law] is that the Shares are owned by the Partnership, then the legal title to those Shares is determined as a matter of Cayman Islands law\" (Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 233:11-14). On that basis, the Tribunal concludes that Cayman law accepts the reference of Korea's private international law.\n\n160.\n\nThis result is not contradicted by statutory provisions of Korean law, such as Article 311.1 of the Capital Markets Act194 or the Real Name Act195.\n\nArticle 311.1 of the Capital Markets Act **[R-14]** provides that \"[a]ny person who is stated in an investor's account book and the depositor's account book shall be deemed to hold the respective securities.\"\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Real Name Act itself is not part of the record but that the Act has been interpreted in the Concurring Opinion of the Korean Supreme Court, Decision Case No. 2015-Da-248342, 23 March 2017 **[R-10]**, pp. 6-7 as establishing a presumption that \"only the title holders entered in the shareholder registry must be deemed shareholders.\"\n\n161.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is not convinced that these provisions deal with ownership. In the Korean original, the verb \"to hold\" in Article 311.1 of the Capital Markets Act is not identical with the verb \"to own\".196 As regards the registration as foreign investor and on the companies' shareholder registries, the Korean law experts essentially agree that neither registration has any direct bearing on ownership rights under Korean law.197\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 391:10-17 [Cross-examination of Professor Rho].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 364:14-365:4, 366:8-376:25 [Cross-examination of Professor Rho]; Kwon Opinion **[CER-3]**, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55.\n\n162.\n\nSecond, there is no need to resort to any of the legal presumptions in the above-mentioned provisions. In the present case, there is only one legal entity, namely the General Partner, that is capable of holding rights on trust for the Cayman Fund. As explained above, when the Cayman Fund is recorded as the titleholder, this refers to a legal nullity and is understood as referring to the General Partner under the applicable law. There is thus no discrepancy between the holder of the trading account, the investment registration and the shareholder registration and the General Partner. The present case is different from the scenario described by Professor Rho in which a purchaser acquires shares in the name of a third person who is designated as titleholder.198 In the present instance, the entity that was designated as titleholder does not exist as a legal person.\n\nRho Opinion **[RER-2]**, \u00b6 31.\n\n163.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that under the applicable municipal laws, the General Partner became the legal owner of the Samsung Shares.\n\n*(iii) Beneficial ownership*\n----------------------------\n\n164.\n\nAs an alternative argument, Respondent submits that, even if Cayman law applied to the question of legal ownership under Article 11.28 of the FTA, the General Partner held the Samsung Shares only in trust for the Cayman Fund, relying on the finding in *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* that \"[a]s trustee, Blue Bank does not own the assets, but simply manages and administers them \u2026 to the benefit of a third party.\"199 Respondent submits that the Samsung Shares were part of the Cayman Fund's estate and that any dividends or proceeds from a sale of the Samsung Shares would only benefit the Cayman Fund but not the General Partner in its capacity as trustee.200 In essence, Respondent argues that the General Partner was not the beneficial owner of the Samsung Shares.\n\nReply, \u00b6 60, fn. 134, citing *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* [**RLA-23**], \u00b6 163.\n\nReply, \u00b6 60, fn. 134.\n\n165.\n\nAs pointed out above, Claimants contend that Article 11.28 of the FTA does not impose a requirement of beneficial ownership. In any event, Claimants submit that \"[t]he General Partner is pursuing its own claim based on *its own* rights under the Treaty as the legal and beneficial owner of the Samsung Shares.\"201\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 123.\n\n166.\n\nAs is clear from the legal authorities cited support of the Parties' submissions, there are two major schools of thought on the implications of a split between legal and beneficial ownership in international investment case law and scholarly writings.\n\n167.\n\nThe first school considers that there is a general principle of international investment law that a claimant only qualifies as an investor to the extent that it can prove a beneficial interest in the investment. According to this view, legal title alone is insufficient to establish ownership. Representative of this school of thought is Professor Stern's dissenting opinion in *Occidental v. Ecuador* which states:\n\nAs far as the position of international law towards beneficial owners, in cases where the legal title and the beneficial ownership are split, is concerned, it is quite uncontroversial, after a thorough review of the existing doctrine and case-law, that international law grants relief to the owner of the economic interest.202\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Dissenting Opinion of Professor Stern, 20 September 2012 (\"***Occidental Dissent***\") [**RLA-15**], \u00b6 148.\n\n168.\n\nThis was affirmed by the annulment committee in the same matter in the following terms:\n\nIn cases where legal title is split between a nominee and a beneficial owner international law is uncontroversial: as Arbitrator Stern has stated in her Dissent the dominant position in international law grants standing and relief to the owner of the beneficial interest \u2013 not to the nominee.203\n\n*Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 259. The annulment committee added the following observations on Professor Stern's analysis: \"The position as regards beneficial ownership is a reflection of a more general principle of international investment law: claimants are only permitted to submit their own claims, held for their own benefit, not those held (be it as nominees, agents or otherwise) on behalf of third parties not protected by the relevant treaty. And tribunals exceed their jurisdiction if they grant compensation to third parties whose investments are not entitled to protection under the relevant instrument. This subjective limitation of ICSID jurisdiction is a natural consequence of international investment law. Arbitral tribunals are not courts of justice holding unfettered jurisdiction. \u2026 Specifically, protected investors cannot transfer beneficial ownership and control in a protected investment to an unprotected third party, and expect that the arbitral tribunal retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the third party and the host State. To hold the contrary would open the floodgates to an uncontrolled expansion of jurisdiction ratione personae, beyond the limits agreed by the States when executing the treaty.\" (*Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6\u00b6 262-264). On this basis, the annulment committee reached the following conclusion: \"By compensating a protected investor for an investment which is beneficially owned by a non-protected investor, the Tribunal has illicitly expanded the scope of its jurisdiction and has acted with an excess of powers. \u2026 In the present case, the excess of powers is manifest \u2026\" (*Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6\u00b6 266, 268).\n\n169.\n\nThe second school of thought does not accept that, under general international investment law, only the beneficial owner fulfils the characteristics of an investor. For example, the tribunal in *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* made the following observations on the division of legal title and beneficial ownership:\n\n[T]he division of property rights amongst several persons or the separation of legal and beneficial ownership is commonly accepted in a number of legal systems, be it through a trust, a *fiducie* or any other similar structure. Such structures are in no way indicative of a sham or a fraudulent conveyance, and no such presumption should be entertained without convincing evidence to the contrary. The separation of legal title and beneficial ownership rights does not deprive such ownership of the characteristics of an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT. Neither the ICSID Convention, nor the BIT make any distinction which could be interpreted as an exclusion of a bare legal title from the scope of the ICSID Convention or from the protection of the BIT.204\n\n*Saba v. Turkey* [**CLA-40**], \u00b6 134.\n\n170.\n\nAlong the same lines, the tribunal in *Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe* considered *prima facie* evidence of legal ownership sufficient to establish jurisdiction:\n\nThe next ground of challenge is that the von Pezold Claimants have not proved beneficial ownership. The Tribunal can find no requirement that beneficial ownership be proven in either the Swiss or German BITs, and sees no basis on which such a requirement should be read into the BITs. In the present case, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have provided prima facie evidence of legal ownership which has not been rebutted and this is sufficient to establish jurisdiction.205\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, Award, 28 July 2015 (\"***Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe***\" *)*  **[CLA-27]**, \u00b6 314. In similar vein, the tribunal in *Flemingo v. Poland* [**CLA-68**], \u00b6 331 stated: \"With regard to Respondent's alternative submission that only 'the ultimate beneficiary of the investment' would be entitled to the Treaty's protection, the Tribunal observes that, as between Claimant and the ultimate beneficiary of the investment, there are indeed three layers of companies \u2026 However, the Tribunal notes again that the Treaty did not expressly provide for the limitation of treaty protection to the ultimate beneficiary of the investment and, therefore, such a restriction cannot be read into it.\"\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that at this stage of the proceedings it can leave open which school of thought should be applied to the present case. Even assuming, without deciding, that the FTA and/or applicable rules of international law require an investor beneficially to own the investment, the Tribunal is convinced that the General Partner fulfils that requirement. As the Tribunal will explain below, Claimants have sufficiently established that the General Partner has a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares.\n\n172.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the facts underlying the question whether the General Partner has a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares are largely undisputed.\n\n173.\n\nNotably, there is no dispute between the Parties that the General Partner did not make any cash capital contributions to the Cayman Fund. It is also undisputed that every year the General Partner took out most of the Incentive Allocations credited to its capital account and that it withdrew most of its Incentive Allocation for 2013 in January 2014. Finally, there is no dispute that as a result of the Cayman Fund's losses in 2014, the General Partner did not receive any Incentive Allocation in 2015 and that in January 2015, the General Partner's capital account contained at most \"a couple of hundred thousand dollars\".206\n\nSee above at \u00b6\u00b6 61-63.\n\n174.\n\nThere are also several points of agreement between the two experts on Cayman law, Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds. First, they concur that Cayman law distinguishes between legal title and beneficial interest.207 Second, the experts are in agreement that the General Partner's beneficial interest in the Cayman Fund, including the Samsung Shares, is determined by the terms of the Partnership Agreement.208 Third, they agree that any beneficial interest that a partner may have in the partnership assets is indivisible in the sense that a partner is not entitled to particular assets.209 Fourth, they concur that the concept of indivisibility does not determine the amount of a partner's beneficial interest in the partnership.210 Fifth, they agree that under Cayman law any legal proceedings by or against an exempted limited partnership may be instituted by or against the general partner only.211\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 235:6-11 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 239:11-16 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 239:17-241:1 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 321:7-322:6 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\nFirst ER Lindsay [**CER-1**], \u00b6 25; Reynolds Opinion **[RER-1]**, \u00b6 33.\n\n175.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree on whether the General Partner's beneficial interest is determined based on the balance of its capital account or by reference to its entitlement to an Incentive Allocation. While Respondent argues that the General Partner's beneficial interest in July 2015 amounted to zero as the General Partner had virtually nothing in its capital account in 2015 and could not earn an Incentive Allocation regardless of the performance of the Samsung Shares,212 Claimants argue that the General Partner's beneficial interest is determined by reference to the increase or decrease in value of the partnership assets.213\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, pp. 462:21-463:5, 464:19-465:4 [Respondent's Closing Statement].\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 36, citing Second ER Lindsay **[CER-2]**, \u00b6 22.\n\n176.\n\nIn accordance with the expert testimony of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds, the Tribunal will begin its analysis of the General Partner's beneficial interest by looking at the wording of Partnership Agreement.\n\n177.\n\nArticle 2.12 of the Partnership Agreement defines the term \"Partnership Interests\" as \"a Partner's interest in the Partnership. The Partner's economic interest shall be expressed as a percentage equal to (i) the balance in the Capital Account of such Partner divided by (ii) the aggregate balance in the Capital Accounts of all the Partners at any given time.\"214\n\nPartnership Agreement **[C-30]**, Article 2.12.\n\n178.\n\nWhile at first glance the concept of \"Partnership Interest\" does not appear to be limited to the Limited Partners' economic interest in the Partnership, a systematic review of the provisions in the Partnership Agreement referring to this concept shows that the term is tailored to Limited Partners. The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Lindsay's assessment that the Partnership Agreement uses the term only in respect of \"the withdrawal or transfer by any Limited Partner of its interest in the Partnership; and \u2026 obtaining the necessary consent of Limited Partners to the admission of an additional General Partner\",215 the withdrawal of the General Partner, which the Limited Partners holding Partnership Interests of a certain threshold must consent to,216 and the winding-up of the Partnership following the withdrawal of the General Partner in which case the Limited Partners holding Partnership Interests of a certain threshold may appoint a successor.217 Consequently, the definition of \"Partnership Interest\" in Article 2.12 of the Partnership Agreement is insufficient to establish the General Partner's beneficial interest in the partnership assets.\n\nSecond ER Lindsay **[CER-2]**, \u00b6 18, referring to Partnership Agreement [**C-30**], Articles 5.04(b), 6.02, 7.01., 7.07, 8.01, 8.02, 11.02 **]**.\n\nPartnership Agreement **[C-30]**, Article 7.05.\n\nPartnership Agreement **[C-30]**, Articles 10.01(a), 10.04.\n\n179.\n\nArticle 4.06(b) of the Partnership Agreement provides, in relevant part, that \"[w]ith respect to each Capital Account of a Limited Partner, as of the end of each Fiscal Year, there shall be allocated to the Capital Account of the General Partner, as its incentive allocation \u2026 20% of \u2026 the Cumulative Net Profits preliminarily allocated to such Capital Account of such Limited Partner\" minus any management fees and expenses paid by the Limited Partner and to the extent that the \"Cumulative Net Profits\" exceed the \"Cumulative Unrecovered Net Losses\" of previous years.218\n\nPartnership Agreement **[C-30]**, Article 4.06(b).\n\n180.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this general entitlement to an Incentive Allocation represents a beneficial interest of the General Partner in the Partnership's assets. It is undeniable that the Incentive Allocation entitles the General Partner to share in the benefits of ownership of the Partnership's assets. Whenever the Partnership's assets gain in value and generate net profits above a certain watermark, the General Partner gets its share of these profits.\n\n181.\n\nWhile under the Partnership Agreement the General Partner's beneficial interest in the partnership assets could in theory not only be determined by its entitlement to an Incentive Allocation but also by its capital contributions, this question does not arise in the present case as the General Partner has not to date made any cash contributions. Consequently, the entitlement to an Incentive Allocation reflects a beneficial interest of the General Partner, in its own right, in the Partnership's assets including the Samsung Shares.\n\n182.\n\nWhether or not this entitlement to an Incentive Allocation results in a payment in any given year is a different question that is of no relevance to the determination of the General Partner's beneficial interest in the Partnership's assets. Even if this entitlement does not materialize in a specific year, this does not deprive the General Partner of its entitlement to share in any future profits the same assets might generate. If this were not the case, the General Partner's beneficial interest in any given year could only be determined retroactively. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider the balance of the General Partner's capital account in 2015 to be dispositive of its beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares at the time of the alleged breaches of the FTA.\n\n183.\n\nHaving concluded that the General Partner's entitlement to an Incentive Allocation represents a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares, the Tribunal need not at present decide whether the General Partner has a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares beyond its Incentive Allocation, for example an interest based on its entitlement to apply the assets of the Partnership in discharge of the Partnership's debts for which it, the General Partner, is solely responsible.219\n\nSee below at \u00b6 224.\n\n184.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes, however, that Claimants' argument220 that the concept of indivisibility determines the extent of its beneficial interest in the Partnership's assets has not been confirmed by the Parties' experts. They have stated at the Hearing:\n\nQ. Then, on a last topic, I'm coming back to the discussion of indivisibility. Does the notion of 'indivisibility' determine the amount of a Partner's beneficial interest in the Partnership?\n\nA. (Ms. Reynolds) Do you mean quantum?\n\nQ. Yes.\n\nA. (Ms. Reynolds) I would say no.\n\nA. (Mr. Lindsay) No, it doesn't. That's the whole \u2013 that is the point of indivisibility.\n\nSo, to the extent that two or three assets perform especially well and the General Partner feels buoyed by the idea that it will share in the upside of those assets, it has, until the point that you conduct the calculation of the Net Profit at the end of the year, it has notionally an indivisible interest in the upside of those assets. If one asset, then, performs particularly badly, then the General Partner loses the benefit of the stellar performance of the other assets.\n\nQ. Right.\n\nSo, does the notion of indivisibility help us to determine if a Partner has, for example, 1 percent beneficial interest or a 99 percent beneficial interest?\n\nA. (Mr. Lindsay) No.\n\nA. (Ms. Reynolds) No. (emphasis added)221\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, pp. 500:6-501:5 [Claimants' Closing Statement]; pp. 538:25-539:15 [Claimants' Counsel].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, p. 321:7-322:6 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds]; Second ER Lindsay **[CER-2]**, \u00b6 10.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with that mutual view of the experts. Furthermore, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to further differentiate between the beneficial and the economic interest of the General Partner in the Partnership's assets, as suggested by Claimants in their closing statement.222 In the Tribunal's view, both terms can be used interchangeably and relate to the General Partner's right to share in the benefits of ownership of the Partnership's assets.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, pp. 500:6-501:5 [Claimants' Closing Statement].\n\n186.\n\nAs a last point on this issue, the Tribunal observes that it is this entitlement to share in the Partnership's profits that distinguishes the General Partner from the claimant in *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* who \"as a trustee holding the assets of the Qatar Trust for the ultimate benefit of third party interests, does not own the assets of the Qatar Trust, did not invest these assets for its own account and cannot, therefore, ground jurisdiction on any investment made by it\".223 Contrary to a bare trustee, the General Partner is not disinterested in the Partnership's property but holds, in its own right, a beneficial interest in these assets which makes him a beneficial co-owner.\n\n*Blue Bank v. Venezuela* **[RLA-23]**, \u00b6 172.\n\n187.\n\nBased on this finding and without ruling on any requirement of beneficial ownership under the FTA or international law, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument that the General Partner was not a beneficial owner of the Samsung Shares.\n\n*(iv) Estoppel*\n---------------\n\n188.\n\nAs a final point on ownership, the Tribunal addresses Respondent's argument that the General Partner is estopped from relying on its ownership of the Samsung Shares due to the registration of the Cayman Fund as foreign investor without disclosure of the General Partner's purported interest.224\n\nReply, \u00b6 59.\n\n189.\n\nWithout ruling on the applicability or the prerequisites of the estoppel doctrine, the Tribunal considers that the requirements advanced by Respondent are not met. As the Tribunal has determined above,225 the registration of the Cayman Fund as the titleholder has to be understood as referring to the General Partner under the applicable municipal laws. Consequently, there is no mismatch between the recorded and the actual investor.\n\nSee above at \u00b6\u00b6 151-163.\n\n190.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent has not established that it actually relied on the representations as there is no indication that the application would not have been granted if it had been submitted in the General Partner's name. Finally, Respondent has not shown that it suffered a loss, or that Claimants derived a benefit, from the representations made on the foreign investment registration application.\n\n191.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's estoppel argument and concludes that the General Partner owned the Samsung Shares in the sense of Article 11.28 of the FTA.\n\n*(v) Control*\n-------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Respondent's argument that the General Partner did not, directly or indirectly, control the Samsung Shares.\n\n193.\n\nRespondent's argument is twofold: first, Respondent asserts that because the General Partner was not registered as an owner on the shareholder registries of SEC and SC&T, it did not have the legal capacity to exercise any shareholding rights under Korean law;226 second, Respondent submits that whatever control the General Partner exercised over the Samsung Shares was only in the name of the legal owner, the Cayman Fund, and that this is similar to a situation where a director exercises shareholder rights on behalf of a corporation.227\n\nReply, \u00b6 61.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62.\n\n194.\n\nIn relation to the first point, the Tribunal refers to its earlier findings that the Cayman Fund lacks legal personality and that, although the Cayman Fund was nominally registered on the shareholder registries of SEC and SC&T, it could exercise its shareholding rights only through the General Partner.228 Under Cayman law, to which Korean private international law refers in this context, the General Partner is the only entity that is entitled to exercise any rights associated with the ownership of the Partnership's assets.\n\nSee above at \u00b6 162.\n\n195.\n\nThe present case is therefore different from the situation described in the second part of Respondent's argument. The General Partner did not exercise any shareholder rights on behalf of a corporation but in its own name.\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the General Partner controlled the Samsung Shares, *de jure* and *de facto.*\n\n2) Whether the General Partner has failed to make an investment under the FTA\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Respondent's second argument that the General Partner does not qualify as an investor as it has failed to make an investment under the FTA.\n\n198.\n\nAs a preliminary issue, the Tribunal will address the question whether the FTA only affords protection to investors who themselves have made the covered investment.\n\n199.\n\nRespondent argues that the investor itself must have made an investment that fulfils the characteristics of an investment under the FTA.229 In Claimants' submission, Respondent attempts to construct two additional, extra-textual hurdles for investors: (i) a requirement that, to meet the definition of an investor under the FTA, a claimant must also demonstrate certain characteristics found in the definition of investment; and (ii) by claiming that the FTA only affords protection to investors who make an active contribution.230\n\nReply, \u00b6 26.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while Article 11.28 of the FTA defines an \"investor of a Party\" as \"a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of the other Party \u2026\", the definition of \"investment\" under the same provision describes the relationship between an investor and an investment in the following terms: \"investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk\" (emphasis added).\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal thus has to decide whether the relationship between protected assets and qualifying nationals is exclusively governed by the concepts of (direct or indirect) ownership or control or whether the use of the verb \"making\" in the definition of an investor imposes additional requirements on the investor.\n\n202.\n\nThis question is inextricably linked to Respondent's core legal proposition that an investor must beneficially own the investment. Respondent's argument that an investor needs to make an own contribution, expect own gain or profit and assume own risk presupposes that an investor enjoys the benefits of legal ownership.231\n\nThis connection between the making of an investment and the requirement of beneficial ownership has also been noted by Hanno Wehland, *Blue Bank International v. Venezuela: When Are Trust Assets Protected under International Investment Agreements*, 34(6) J. Int'l Arb. (2017) [**RLA-22**], p. 956 (\"[B]eneficial ownership may indeed be a requirement for obtaining treaty protection, simply because in the absence of any beneficial interest, an 'investment' will typically not have been made.\").\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal need not decide this question. Nor does it need to rule on the issue whether the specific characteristics listed in the definition of investment are merely stated by way of example or need to be fulfilled cumulatively. In light of the Tribunal's prior finding in relation to the General Partner's beneficial interest, and as will be set out in more detail below, the General Partner fulfils all additional requirements that Respondent invokes. In particular, the General Partner has made its own contribution *(i)* , expected its own gain or profit *(ii)* and assumed its own risk *(iii)* . In addition, and again without ruling on the existence of such jurisdictional requirement, the General Partner has held the Samsung Shares for a sufficient duration *(iv)* .\n\n*(i) Commitment of capital or other resources*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nRespondent's argument on the absence of a meaningful contribution centres on Claimants' alleged failure to establish that the General Partner had acquired the Samsung Shares with its own capital as opposed to the capital of the Cayman Fund. This leads Respondent to conclude that the General Partner did not make a contribution, let alone a meaningful one, of its own financial means and at its own financial risk that would qualify as an investment.232 According to Respondent, the General Partner's alleged contribution of knowledge and management merely constitutes pre-investment activity that is not protected under the FTA, did not transfer value and contribute to Samsung's business and therefore does not qualify as the contribution of \"other resources\".233 According to Respondent, Claimants have also not established that any pre-investment analysis was in fact performed by the General Partner and not by the Investment Manager.234\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, referring to *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan* [**RLA-17**], \u00b6\u00b6 192-206; *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* [**RLA-23**], \u00b6\u00b6 163, 172; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 40.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\nReply, \u00b6 36.\n\n205.\n\nClaimants argue that the General Partner made a contribution by committing the capital under its exclusive control to the acquisition of the Shares (totalling approximately USD 5.56 billion) and contributed its investment decision-making, management and expertise (totalling approximately USD 0.96 billion).235 According to Claimants, this qualifies as the contribution of \"other resources\" in the sense of Article 11.28 of the FTA. In relation to the temporal scope, Claimants point to the fact that the definition of \"investor\" in Article 11.28 of the FTA comprises \"attempts to make \u2026 an investment\" and thus also extends to the pre-investment phase.236 Furthermore, Claimants assert that the General Partner engaged as a significant minority shareholder in an ongoing dialogue with the Samsung Group even after acquisition of the shares.237\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 58.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 61.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 62, citing Second WS Garschina **[CWS-3]**, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal bears in mind the fact that the General Partner did not make any cash contributions to the Partnership and that the funds used to acquire the Samsung Shares originate from the Limited Partner's cash contributions.238\n\nSee above at \u00b6 59.\n\n207.\n\nHowever, again, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to decide whether the origin of the capital used to acquire the shares plays a role in determining whether the General Partner has made an own contribution. In the Tribunal's view, Claimants have sufficiently established that the General Partner's investment decision-making, management and expertise constitutes a commitment of \"other resources\" in the sense of Article 11.28 of the FTA.\n\n208.\n\nMr. Garschina has described these activities in his written testimony in the following way:\n\nThe team under my supervision spent hundreds of hours investigating and analyzing Samsung Electronics and the Samsung Group. The internal team regularly met and discussed the company's performance, including reviewing analyst reports from local and international brokers, and preparing and compiling models for the companies. The team travelled to Korea, and worked with other market participants (including other foreign investors in Samsung, and investment banks), with experts on Korean companies and the Korean market, and with the Samsung Group's investor relations group \u2026\n\nWhile Mason was a minority foreign investor, and its ability to control the ultimate direction of the company was limited, it was clear that Samsung was at least outwardly interested in the views of foreign investors on Samsung's approach to corporate governance. The team's regular meetings with Samsung's investor relations group were not only an opportunity to learn more about the drivers of the Samsung business, but also to express our views and suggestions on Samsung's corporate strategy, provide feedback on the expectations of the market, and contribute to the pressure on Samsung to reform its internal governance.239\n\nSecond WS Garschina **[CER-3]**, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\n209.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that the FTA generally allows contributions in kind.240 Instead, Respondent's arguments centre on the temporal aspect and the involvement of the Investment Manager.\n\nSee Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, p. 474:6-8 [Respondent's Closing Statement].\n\n210.\n\nIn respect of Respondent's argument that these activities predate the investment in the Samsung Shares, the Tribunal considers that pre-investment activities are included in the ambit of the FTA. This follows from the definition of investor whose explicit language (\"attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment\") extends the FTA's temporal scope of application to the preinvestment phase. The ordinary meaning of these terms, which the Tribunal shall have regard to under Article 11.22.1 of the FTA in conjunction with Article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is that an investor is already protected by the FTA if it is still in the process of making an investment.\n\n211.\n\nRegarding the involvement of the Investment Manager, the Tribunal is aware of Mr. Satzinger's testimony that all staff was employed by the Investment Manager.241 Yet both Mr. Satzinger and Mr. Garschina also state in their witness statements that the decision-making authority in Mason and its related entities rested in the General Partner at all times, and that the General Partner has merely delegated the exercise of some of its authority under the Partnership Agreement to the Investment Manager which remained under the supervision of the General Partner.242\n\nFirst WS Satzinger **[CWS-2]**, \u00b6 8; Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 177:22-24 [Cross-examination of Mr. Satzinger].\n\nFirst WS Garschina **[CWS-1]**, \u00b6 6; First WS Satzinger **[CWS-2]**, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n212.\n\nThe General Partner's decision-making authority is confirmed by Article 3.01 of the Partnership Agreement which provides that \"[t]he management, control and the conduct of the business of the Partnership shall be vested exclusively in the General Partner.\"243 The Partnership Agreement also explicitly provides for the possibility that the General Partner employs agents in the performance of its services.244 Finally, only the General Partner but not the Investment Manager was entitled to share in the benefits of the Partnership's assets and thereby assumed risk, as the Tribunal will explain in more detail below.245\n\nPartnership Agreement **[C-30]**, Article 3.01.\n\nArticle 3.02 of the Partnership Agreement **[C-30]** provides in relevant terms: \"The General Partner shall have the power by itself on behalf and in the name of the Partnership to carry out any and all of the objects and purposes of the Partnership set forth in Section 1.05, and to perform all acts and enter into and perform all contracts and other undertakings which it may deem necessary or advisable or incidental thereto, and to have and possess the same rights and powers as any general partner in a partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands, including, without limitation, to: \u2026 (l) employ such agents, brokers, consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants, as it deems reasonably appropriate and necessary for the conduct of the business of the Partnership \u2026 (emphasis added).\"\n\nSee below at \u00b6\u00b6 219-225.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that any work by the Investment Manager was performed on behalf and in the exercise of the General Partner's rights and obligations under the Partnership Agreement.\n\n214.\n\nAs a final point on the issue of contribution, the Tribunal has taken note of Mr. Lindsay's and Ms. Reynold's initial disagreement on whether investment expertise qualifies as a contribution in kind under Cayman law.246 In the Tribunal's view, whether investment expertise constitutes a contribution in kind under Cayman law is not relevant to the question at issue whether the General Partner's investment decision-making, management and expertise qualifies as the commitment of \"other resources\" in the sense of Article 11.28 of the FTA.\n\nReynolds Opinion **[RER-1]**, \u00b6 42; Second ER Lindsay **[CER-2]**, \u00b6 17.\n\n215.\n\nAt the Hearing, it became clear that the experts were essentially in agreement that, while the value of the General Partner's investment expertise was not initially reflected in its capital account, this did not mean that the Partnership Agreement did not ascribe to it any value at all. Rather, the Incentive Allocation reflects the value that the Partnership Agreement assigns to the General Partner's investment expertise.247\n\nSee Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 2, 3 October 2019, pp. 273:6-279:16 [Expert conferencing of Mr. Lindsay and Ms. Reynolds].\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with that assessment. The Partnership Agreement is structured in such way that the General Partner contributes its investment decision-making, management and expertise to the benefit of the Partnership and receives an Incentive Allocation in return for these services. In the Tribunal's view, the provision of these services constitutes a contribution of \"other resources\" in the sense of the FTA.\n\n217.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that the General Partner has made a contribution within the meaning of Article 11.28 of the FTA.\n\n*(ii) Expectation of gain or profit*\n------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the General Partner, through its entitlement to an Incentive Allocation, had an expectation of gain or profit.248\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 35:18-22 [Respondent's Opening Statement].\n\n*(iii) Assumption of risk*\n--------------------------\n\n219.\n\nTurning to the question whether the General Partner assumed any risk in respect of the Samsung Shares, the Tribunal will first address Respondent's argument that a claimant does not bear any risk associated with the acquisition of equity where it has not made any capital contribution to that acquisition.249\n\nReply, \u00b6 43.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its prior finding that the General Partner's investment decision-making, management and expertise constitutes a commitment of other resources.250 While the General Partner has not made any cash contributions, the Partnership Agreement assigns a value to the services rendered by the General Partner. Given that this value is dependent on the performance of the Partnership's assets, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants' submission that the General Partner assumed the risk that, despite its commitment of other resources, the Partnership's assets, including the Samsung Shares, would not appreciate in value and that it would not receive any Incentive Allocation.251\n\nSee above at \u00b6\u00b6 204-217.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal need not go any further and look at any spill-over effects in respect of other assets of the Partnership.252 Any depreciation in the value of the Samsung Shares can negatively affect the General Partner's Incentive Allocation and thereby curtail its ability to recover the costs and expenses associated with its services.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 69, referring to Second ER Lindsay **[CER-2]**, \u00b6 30(b).\n\n222.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's characterization of the Incentive Allocation as a \"one-sided arrangement that allowed the [General Partner] to share in the upside of market operations (such as the acquisition of the Samsung Shares) without any liability to share in their downside\".253 The General Partner shares in the downside by having rendered its services in vain and without receiving any consideration.\n\nReply, \u00b6 45.\n\n223.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the Partnership Agreement254 limits the General Partner's liability towards the Limited Partner or the Partnership does not absorb the above-mentioned risk that the General Partner is unable to make good for its contribution of other resources.\n\nArticle 3.06 of the Partnership Agreement **[C-30]** provides: \"The General Partner (and its members, employees, agents and affiliates) (each, a 'Covered Person') shall not be liable to any other Partner or the Partnership for any loss suffered by the Partnership unless such loss is caused by such Covered Person's Gross Negligence, willful misconduct or breach of fiduciary duty\u2026\".\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal may also have to determine whether the General Partner's undisputed liability to discharge the debts of the Partnership could have some relevance for the assessment of its alleged own loss.255\n\nSee Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, pp. 519:13-527:12.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the General Partner assumed the investment risk that it would not receive an Incentive Allocation in exchange for the resources contributed by it.\n\n*(iv) Duration*\n---------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the Parties' disagreement as to whether there is an additional implicit requirement under the FTA and/or general international investment law that the investment needs to be held for a sufficient duration.256 The Tribunal is aware that the non-exhaustive list of characteristics of an investment in Article 11.28 of the FTA does not include any requirement as to the duration of an investment. Yet the Tribunal need not rule on this legal issue as the General Partner fulfils any implicit requirement suggested by Respondent.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 71-76.\n\n227.\n\nThe Parties agree that if a duration requirement is to be applied, the Tribunal needs to look to the intended duration of the investment.257\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 55, citing *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan* [**RLA-17**], \u00b6 209 (\"When assessing the duration in light of the circumstances, the question arises about the weight to be given to the investor's intentions or expectations in terms of duration. Like the tribunals in Deutsche Bank and in L.E.S.I, this one is of the opinion that 'it is the intended duration period that should be considered to determine whether the criterion is satisfied'\". See also *Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/2, Award, 31 October 2012 ***(\"Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka\")***  **[CLA-30]**, \u00b6 304 (\"[I]t is the intended duration period that should be considered to determine whether the criterion is satisfied.\").\n\n228.\n\nIn the absence of an explicit requirement of duration in the FTA, there are no clear indications which duration is to be deemed sufficient. Assuming (but not deciding) that an implicit duration requirement exists, the Tribunal agrees with the flexible approach adopted by other tribunals, as formulated by the *Romak v. Uzbekistan* tribunal:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that, as a matter of principle, there is some fixed minimum duration that determines whether assets qualify as investments. Short-term projects are not deprived of 'investment' status solely by virtue of their limited duration. Duration is to be analyzed in light of all of the circumstances, and of the investor's overall commitment.258\n\n*Romak v. Uzbekistan* **[RLA-10]**, \u00b6 225. This standard has been confirmed in *Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka* **[CLA-30]**, \u00b6 303 (\"With respect to duration, the Tribunal once again agrees with Schreuer that '[duration] is a very flexible term. It could be anything from a couple of months to many years'. Further, the Tribunal concurs with the statement made by the Tribunal in *Romak v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, holding that 'short-term projects are not deprived of 'investment' status solely by virtue of their limited duration. Duration is to be analysed in light of all the circumstances, and of the investor's overall commitment'.\").\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the General Partner satisfies this standard and held the Samsung Shares for a sufficient duration.\n\n230.\n\nIn his written testimony, Mr. Garschina has described Mason's investment strategy as follows:\n\nWhat prompted us to invest at that time was the prospect that the transition to the next generation of leadership would require a significant restructuring of the Samsung Group. The restructuring would be a catalyst to unlock value in the business for shareholders. The Samsung heir apparent was under a lot of pressure from shareholders (particularly foreign shareholders) to improve governance and increase returns \u2026\n\nConsistent with our view, Samsung was interested in foreign investors' preferences for returns and a desire to be in line with global peers within 2-3 years. Samsung's view was that restructuring was likely to take the form of a holding/operating company structure, but this was 'unlikely to be a near-term event' given tax, money and other logistics involved.259\n\nSecond WS Garschina **[CWS-3]**, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\n231.\n\nAt the Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Mr. Garschina added that\n\n[a]lso a part of it was the corporate environment in Korea and the fact that laws had been passed that would require certain structures to be unwound. Those structures, commonly referred to as the 'chaebol' system, are a group of circularity- driven \u2013 I mean, if you looked at the Mason capital structure, and I'm confused by it, if you looked at the Samsung structure, your brain would explode, so the Government of Korea said this is not hospitable to investment capital.260\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 123:16-25 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n232.\n\nAlso at the Hearing, Mr. Garschina commented on the time horizon of Mason's investment in Samsung as follows:\n\nQ. And do I understand your testimony to be that the time horizon on your Samsung holdings was longer than three to nine months?\n\nA. It was impossible to tell because of the complexity of it. \u2026\n\nQ. It was impossible to tell, I think that's good enough.\n\nA. You know, some investments you make, there's a merger agreement, and you're going to get paid a certain amount of money, and it's feasible to bracket a time period where you're going to receive your money. Other investments \u2013 and \u2013 and having a shorter time, your money invested for a shorter period of time is not a bad thing, it's a good thing, because your Internal Rate of Return will be higher and your investor's capital will be at risk for a shorter period of time and for less market risk, a lot of other factors that we were not interested in imposing on our investors unnecessarily.\n\nBut this investment is more of an open-ended, long-term investment because the gestation period for change in Korea was going to be long. I would compare it to like a long bankruptcy investment where you have the process moves along quite slowly as evidenced by the fact that we're still sitting here in 2019, and they're still restructuring. (emphasis added)261\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, pp. 136:8-137:11 [Cross- examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n233.\n\nMr. Garschina further stated that under normal circumstances Mason intended to hold the Samsung Shares until after the restructuring:\n\nQ. I'm asking you whether that is your testimony, that you intended to hold the Shares until after the restructuring?\n\nA. I think \u2013 I think we were going to hold the Shares until not only in the restructuring happened but at a price \u2013 inherent in investing is being happy where the price is. You can't just \u2013 it's not untrue \u2013\n\nQ. Right.\n\nA. \u2013 but there are many reasons.\n\nQ. Right. So, you were intending to hold the Shares until you could make money selling them in the market; right?\n\nA. Or until there was a reason that we had to get out, which happened in this case.262\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 144:5-18 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal gathers from Mr. Garschina's written and oral testimony that when Mason started investing the duration of the investment was difficult to assess but that Mason expected this to be \"more of an open ended, long term investment\".263\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 137:5-6 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n235.\n\nMr. Garschina's testimony is confirmed by the estimates on the investment's duration provided in contemporaneous email correspondence between Mason employees (and third parties) that has been exhibited together with Mr. Garschina's second witness statement.\n\n236.\n\nOn 22 May 2014,[REDACTED], a Mason employee and member of the core team for the Samsung investment,264 sent an email to other Mason employees as well as Mason's co-founder, Mr. Martino, summarizing the takeaways from a meeting with Samsung's investor relations a few days earlier. In this email,[REDACTED] provided the following assessment of the time horizon of possible overhauls of Samsung's corporate governance:\n\nRe: chairman's health and potential corporate governance, they think the company will eventually have some sort of holdco/opco structure. But this could take easily 5+ years to come to fruition as the amount of tax, money and other logistics involved will make it unlikely to be a near-term event. (emphasis added)265\n\nSecond WS Garschina **[CWS-3]**, \u00b6 4.\n\nEmail from[REDACTED] to [REDACTED] et al., 22 May 2014 **[C-42]**.\n\n237.\n\nIn an email of 27 May 2014, Mason employees circulated a detailed note prepared by the financial services company[REDACTED]. In this note, the author commented on the possible timeframe of any changes in Samsung's corporate governance structure as follows:\n\n[REDACTED] (emphasis added)266\n\nEmail from[REDACTED] to [REDACTED] et al., attaching [REDACTED], 27 May 2014 **[C-43]**, p. 2\n\n238.\n\nIn an email of [REDACTED] to a contact at [REDACTED] of 15 July 2014 in preparation of a trip to Seoul, [REDACTED] describes Mason's investment strategy *inter alia* in the following terms:\n\nWe are primarily value-driven, with a longer-term time horizon. We generally take a bottoms up, fundamental view on most positions. We invest globally across all asset classes, but mostly in equities and credit. We have taken large positions within Asia, that we have held for several years. (emphasis added)267\n\nEmail from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], 15 July 2014 **[C-34]**.\n\n239.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal concludes that the General Partner was prepared to hold the Samsung Shares for a longer term.\n\n240.\n\nContrary to Respondent's assertion, the Tribunal does not see any indications that the General Partner intended \"to exploit short-term fluctuations in share prices associated with the Merger, rather than to make a long-term commitment.\"268 Respondent bases this assertion on the General Partner's allegedly event-driven investment strategy and the timing of the acquisition of the SC&T shares following the announcement of the merger.\n\nReply, \u00b6 53.\n\n241.\n\nAs to Respondent's first point, the Tribunal notes that even if the General Partner's investment had been \"event-driven\" in the sense that the General Partner considered possible changes of Samsung's corporate governance as an opportunity to invest, this is not indicative of any shortterm investment in and by itself. The Tribunal is aware of the due diligence report published by the Rhode Island Office of the General Treasurer describing Mason's investment horizon as being \"shorter than most event driven and distressed managers, with an average holding period of 3 to 9 months.\"269 Independent of whether this statement is a correct and fair description of Mason's investment horizon,270 the Tribunal does not consider that this average holding period was meant to apply to the General Partner's investment in Samsung. As the Tribunal has explained, there are clear indications in Mason's contemporaneous email correspondence that the General Partner intended to hold the Samsung Shares for a longer term. The same due diligence report also acknowledges that \"the fund may be invested in situations that play out over extended periods of time and thus is exposed to market risk\".271\n\nHedge Fund Investment Due Diligence Report, Mason Capital, 31 December 2010 **[R-3]**, p. 6.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted Mr. Garschina's reservations about the report; see Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 120:8-122:10 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\nHedge Fund Investment Due Diligence Report, Mason Capital, 31 December 2010 **[R-3]**, p. 6.\n\n242.\n\nIn relation to Mason's trading pattern between May 2014 and July 2015 and, in particular, the timing of its acquisition of the SC&T shares, the Tribunal has studied Mason's trading records for SEC272 and SC&T273 as well as the explanations provided by Mr. Garschina at the Hearing.\n\nMason trading records Samsung Electronics, 8 August 2015 **[C-31]**.\n\nMason trading records SC&T, 10 August 2015 **[C-32]**. See also above at \u00b6\u00b6 44-57 as well as the demonstrative exhibits **[RDE-1]** and **[RDE-2].**\n\n243.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is aware that Mason sold its entire position in SEC in August 2014 and again in October 2014, the Tribunal does not consider this to be indicative of a short-term investment. At the Hearing, Mr. Garschina described these trades as part of the execution process and independent of Mason's investment strategy:\n\nQ. And isn't it true that you sold your entire holding of Samsung Electronics \u2013 by the 10th of October, you had sold your entire holding of Samsung Electronics?\n\nA. That's what it says. What I would say to you is that part of the execution process often is \u2013 it's like when you're going into an ocean, you don't jump in right away, at least I don't, sometimes you put a leg in, sometimes you put an arm in, and you splash water on yourself, and if you don't like it you may go out, but you ultimately go in, and that's part of the execution process for investing. And I think that's what you're seeing here. It's maximizing, getting the lowest price for our investors for which \u2013 who we're fiduciaries.\n\nQ. I understand the reasons. But what I'm asking you is that by the 10th of October 2014, isn't it true that Mason had liquidated its entire holding in Samsung Electronics?\n\nA. It looks like that, but again, I would say that that's not the end of the investment. That's part of the execution process. (emphasis added)274\n\nQ. You don't say anywhere in your Witness Statements, in your two Witness Statements, Mr. Garschina, that after the period from May 2014 to June 2015 Mason had been trading in and out of Samsung Electronics. You don't say that in your Witness Statements?\n\nA. To me, it's not relevant. Optimizing our price is something completely different from my investment thesis and my investment research and the ideas I have in my mind. (emphasis added)275\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, pp. 147:13-148:7 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, pp. 150:19-151:2 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this explanation convincing. The Tribunal considers that a holistic approach is warranted when looking at the individual buy and sell executions. In the Tribunal's view, Claimants have satisfactorily explained that such buy and sell executions merely constituted price optimizations that are part of Mason's overall investment strategy and do not contradict its intention to hold the Samsung Shares for a longer period of time.\n\n245.\n\nMr. Garschina has explained the timing and the duration of Mason's position in SC&T as follows:\n\nQ. So, Mason held the Shares in SC&T for about two months; right? Correct?\n\nA. Well, we started in April and we ended in August \u2013 August? Yeah, August.\n\nQ. Sorry, Mason \u2013 you started in April, you bought 334,000, you sold them in April, and then you bought in May, in June, early June, and you held them until August. That's about two months.\n\nA. That's the trading record, although I would emphasize that C&T was a proxy for Samsung Electronics. It essentially is a company \u2013 maybe still today; I haven't followed it \u2013 its primary asset was shares in Samsung Electronics. They had some other peripheral assets. But the reason to buy C&T \u2013 there were several reasons, but one of the main reasons to buy it was that it was a cheaper proxy of Samsung Electronics.\n\nSo I don't \u2013 you haven't pointed me to how much Samsung Electronics we owned at this point.\n\nQ. Right.\n\nA. But what I would say is that it's a \u2013 my recollection is that we swapped, not in a financial funding instrument, but we sold some Samsung or just bought Samsung C&T as a cheaper way to buy Samsung Electronics.\n\nSo, when I look at our investment at Samsung, it's in \u2013 for restructuring of Samsung, it says as a whole. It's not C&T or Samsung.\n\nAnd importantly, I think that C&T effectively, its main asset was Samsung Electronics in the cross holdings. So, if you added up the Shares in Samsung Electronics and then added up the other, I believe there was some real estate and a few other operating businesses \u2013 I believe there was a blood \u2013 some sort of generic biotech business \u2013 if you added that up, you are 'creating,' my word, Samsung Electronics at a cheaper price.\n\nSo, when you say we entered C&T and we exited at \u2013 and during a short period of time, I would say two things: One, our investment, as I said before, begins the day we start research. Executing in the market is a switch that we turn on when we want to have economic exposure to that investment process.\n\nAnd two, Samsung and Samsung C&T were not completely disconnected investments since they were overlapping in the sense that they were both inherently exposed to Samsung Electronics and that Samsung C&T was also undergoing a merger vote that we anticipated would have to be \u2013 the exchange ratio would have to be increased if the vote was turned out. (emphasis added)276\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, pp. 154:1-155:24 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n246.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Garschina provided a conclusive explanation as to why Mason decided to increase its position in SC&T while at the same time selling some of its shares in SEC. Mason considered SC&T to be a proxy for SEC which it thereby could acquire at a cheaper price. The Tribunal is persuaded that Mason's holdings in SEC and SC&T are based on the same investment strategy and constitute a coherent investment.\n\n247.\n\nEven if the acquisition of the SC&T was (partially) inspired by the merger announcement, this would not be indicative of an insufficient duration. Rather, as the Tribunal has explained, Mason considered the overhaul of Samsung's corporate governance structure to be an ongoing process.\n\n248.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the General Partner intended to hold the Samsung Shares for a sufficient duration.\n\n***d) Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n249.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the General Partner owned and controlled the Samsung Shares and made an investment in the sense of Article 11.28 of the FTA. Consequently, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's request for a declaration that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim on the basis that: the General Partner has not made an investment in accordance with Article 11.28 of the FTA; and/or the General Partner did not own or control the Samsung Shares; and rejects Respondent's request to dismiss all of the claims brought by the General Partner for that reason.\n\n**2. Whether the General Partner has standing to bring a claim**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a) Respondent's position***\n------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nRespondent submits that the General Partner lacks standing under the FTA and international law, as it has no \"beneficial ownership\" in the alleged investment and brings claims for damages allegedly suffered by the Cayman Fund as a third party.277\n\nReply, \u00b6 64.\n\n251.\n\nIn relation to the FTA, Respondent argues that, pursuant to Article 11.16.1 of the FTA, the General Partner may submit to arbitration claims only \"on its own behalf\" and on behalf of its Korean subsidiaries, but not on behalf of third Parties such as the Cayman Fund.278 Contrary to Claimants' submission, Respondent asserts that the expression \"on its own behalf\" does not merely serve to distinguish regular claims from derivative claims on behalf of an enterprise of Respondent.279 Respondent also contends that legal ownership and control do not suffice to claim compensation for an alleged breach of the FTA.280\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\nReply, \u00b6 67.\n\nReply, \u00b6 67.\n\n252.\n\nRespondent asserts that Article 11.16.1 of the FTA is comprehensive and does not cover the situation where a claimant brings claims on behalf of a third party that is not a host-State enterprise.281 Additionally, absent a beneficial interest, the General Partner cannot have \"incurred loss or damage\" as required by Article 11.16.1(a) of the FTA.282 Moreover, the distinction between Articles 11.16.1(a) and (b) would be rendered meaningless if Claimants' interpretation prevailed since, in either scenario, the entire loss would then be that of Claimants.283\n\nReply, \u00b6 68.\n\nReply, \u00b6 69.\n\nReply, \u00b6 70.\n\n253.\n\nTo support its reading of Article 11.16.1 of the FTA, Respondent refers to investment tribunal decisions on the analogous Articles 1116 and 1117 of the North American Free Trade Agreement.284\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-74, citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Ecuador*, Respondent argues that, in cases where beneficial and legal ownership are not in the same hands, international law grants standing only to the beneficial owner, as the owner of the economic interest, but not to the nominal owner.286\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 11 citing *Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 262; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 64-66.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78, relying on *Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6\u00b6 259, 262, 265-266; *Occidental Dissent* [**RLA-15**], \u00b6\u00b6 148-149, 151.\n\n255.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' contention that these authorities are inapposite because their reasoning is based on the law of diplomatic protection. In this regard, Respondent asserts that a large number of investment tribunals have adopted the above-mentioned principle as a principle of international investment law to dismiss claims brought by nominal owners on behalf of beneficial owners regardless of the principle's position in the law of diplomatic protection.287 In contrast, Respondent submits that the investment tribunal decisions put forward by Claimants are not persuasive since on a closer reading they do not support Claimants' position.288\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 79-86, referring to *Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 259; *Occidental Dissent*, [**RLA-15**], \u00b6\u00b6 139-144; *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

The GP claims the entirety of the alleged loss in value of the Samsung Shares that it held on trust for the benefit of the Cayman Fund, irrespective of the existence and extent of the GP's own loss (which depends on the GP's Partnership Interest in the Samsung Shares, if any).\"295\n\nReply, \u00b6 99.\n\n258.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the General Partner has not shown that it had any Partnership Interest in the Samsung Shares.296 Furthermore, whether the General Partner is \"exclusively responsible for the conduct of the [Cayman Fund's] investment business\", makes all relevant decisions, and is \"the only entity with capacity to engage in legal proceedings with respect to the Cayman Fund's] assets\" is irrelevant to the General Partner's standing under the FTA.297\n\nReply, \u00b6 100.\n\nReply, \u00b6 102.\n\n***b) Claimants' position***\n----------------------------\n\n259.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's attempt to introduce \"standing\" or \"beneficial ownership\" requirements into the FTA, arguing that these are contrary to the express terms of the FTA.298 Indeed, according to Claimants, the General Partner has a standing as it owned and controlled the Samsung Shares.299\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 61; Rejoinder, \u00b6 100.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 60; Rejoinder, \u00b6 113.\n\n260.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent's position rests upon a \"tortured reading\" of Article 11.16 of the FTA which, by its plain terms, does not require a potential claimant to demonstrate \"standing\" premised on beneficial ownership.300 Contrary to Respondent's submission, the term \"on its own behalf\" in Article 11.16.1(a) of the FTA does not introduce such a requirement and is simply used to distinguish regular and derivative claims that can be filed \"on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent\" under Article 11.16.1(b) of the FTA.301\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 62-64; Rejoinder, \u00b6 101.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 65; Rejoinder, \u00b6 102.\n\n261.\n\nClaimants further argue that a \"freestanding general principle\" that denies standing to a party without beneficial ownership does not exist in the regime of international investment law, which is distinct from the customary international law regime of diplomatic protection.302 According to Claimants, the existence of such a principle is not supported by the decisions cited by Respondent and has been rejected by other authorities.303\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 66, referring to *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

Respondent's legal standing argument, as its counsel has made clear in his closing statement at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections,310 is premised on the theory that a claimant only acts on its own behalf if it has a beneficial interest in the investment. Under that logic, the General Partner's claim would qualify as its own to the extent it can establish its beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, p. 518:20-22 [Respondent's Closing Statement] (\"'[B]eneficial interest' is the international label that it's given, it has to be on its own behalf or its own loss or damage.\").\n\n270.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent's alternative request for relief, as formulated in its Reply, has a more limited scope than Respondent's original request for relief as set out in its Memorial.311 Under the amended request for relief, the Tribunal is only requested to dismiss such claims of the General Partner that are for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner. Respondent no longer seeks dismissal of all the General Partner's claims for lack of standing. In other words, Respondent's amended request does not appear to extend to any claims for own loss or damage that the General Partner may have suffered. In fact, Respondent acknowledges that the General Partner might be able to seek recovery of its own loss or damage to the extent of its beneficial interest.312\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 37.\n\nReply, \u00b6 99 (\"The GP claims the entirety of the alleged loss in value of the Samsung Shares that it held on trust for the benefit of the Cayman Fund, irrespective of the existence and extent of the GP's own loss (which depends on the GP's Partnership Interest in the Samsung Shares, if any) .\" (emphasis added)).\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it neither possible nor appropriate to grant Respondent's alternative request for relief at the current stage of the proceedings. This is for several reasons.\n\n272.\n\nFirst, Claimants do not pretend to claim for losses incurred by the Limited Partner and/or the Cayman Fund as asserted by Respondent. Rather, they have repeatedly confirmed that the General Partner is seeking to recover its own loss or damage.313 On Claimants' own case, the General Partner's claim is solely brought in its own right under Article 11.16.1(a) of the FTA.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 28-31, 113, referring to Second ER Lindsay **[CER-2]**, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7; Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, p. 537:15-19 [Claimants' Counsel] (\"The only way in which the General Partner can pursue the claim is in its own role. The General Partner pursuing its claim in its role as General Partner of the Partnership. It's not pursuing a claim in the name of the Partnership.\") and p. 538:20-22 [Claimants' Counsel] (\"[The General Partner] is not bringing a claim on behalf of a third party. It's bringing the claim with regard to its own interests.\").\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that through the entitlement to an Incentive Allocation, the General Partner, in its own right, enjoys a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares.314 It is thus conceivable that the General Partner has suffered own loss or damage in the sense of Article 11.16.1(a) of the FTA.\n\nSee above at \u00b6\u00b6 172-187.\n\n274.\n\nWhether that applies to the General Partner's entire claim or whether the General Partner is in fact seeking recovery of some losses that it did not incur itself is not a question for today.\n\n275.\n\nIt is important to remember that the purpose of this preliminary phase of the proceedings is to deal with such objections that can be swiftly and fairly resolved based on the limited record available to the Tribunal.315 This means, as a corollary, that a tribunal may also decide to defer its decision on a particular issue until such time that it has a full factual and legal record before it.\n\nSee the findings on similarly worded provisions in the Central American \u2013 Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v.

See also below at \u00b6\u00b6 299-300.\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that Claimants have not yet made any submissions on which type of losses the General Partner will eventually seek to recover.316 Given the early stage of these proceedings, this is by no means unusual.\n\nSee Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 3, 4 October 2019, p. 507:10-25 [Claimants' Closing Statement] (\"We have a loss that is capable of legal protection. We have an interest in the performance of the Fund, and that interest is enshrined in a contract. The quantification of its value will depend in the event on the ultimate theory of damage, or theories, which we might choose to deploy. Could be lost profits, could be direct loss, loss of opportunity, an 'alternative transaction' model, could be loss of clients, reputational damage and so on. All of those are categories of loss known to the law. That analysis might take into account past performance, peer performance, market performance, any number of potential future scenarios \u2026 [A]ll of that is for a quantum stage, the quantification stage. It does not, by any stretch, negate the legal sufficiency of the pleaded claim.\").\n\n277.\n\nConsequently, absent a full factual and legal record before it, the Tribunal has no choice but to accept, for the time being, Claimants' assertion that the General Partner is bringing a claim for its own loss or damage. The Tribunal will deal with the General Partner's claim for damages if and when it is put to the Tribunal.\n\n278.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal wishes to underline that granting Respondent's alternative request now would not expedite the proceedings or serve procedural efficiency. Respondent's assertion that its preliminary objections \"would materially reduce the subsequent phase of the proceedings\"317 does not apply to its alternative request for relief premised on the General Partner's alleged lack of standing.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 2.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal is presently not faced with a situation in which there are several distinct investments and where the Tribunal is called upon to differentiate between those investments within its jurisdiction and those which fall outside its competence. Rather, in the present case, there is only one possible investment, the Samsung Shares.\n\n280.\n\nGiven that the General Partner's beneficial interest is indivisible in the sense that it extends to all Samsung Shares (without any determination of the extent of its beneficial interest), it is impossible to distinguish between that part of the shares in which the General Partner has a beneficial interest and that part in which it is not interested and which would therefore fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Respondent thus effectively requests the Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction *pro rata* in respect of the Samsung Shares.\n\n281.\n\nAs a corollary, even if the Tribunal were ultimately to find that the General Partner may, in its own right, only claim for the loss of its Incentive Allocation, the Tribunal would have to deal with issues of liability and quantum for the entirety of the Samsung Shares. Granting Respondent's relief now would not dispose of any of these issues.\n\n282.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's application to dismiss, at this stage of the proceedings, the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that the General Partner lacks standing to submit claims on behalf of third parties under Article 11.16.1 of the FTA. The Tribunal reserves its decision as to whether the General Partner's claim is for its own loss or is tantamount to a claim on behalf of the Limited Partner to a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Respondent's request for a declaration that the General Partner can claim damages only to the extent of its own Partnership Interest in 2015, which Respondent has introduced in its Reply.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its prior finding that the General Partner's beneficial interest is not tantamount to the \"Partnership Interest\" as defined in Article 2.12 of the Partnership Agreement.318 The Tribunal has already decided that the General Partner's entitlement to an Incentive Allocation represents a beneficial interest in the Partnership's assets and is independent of the balance of its capital account in 2015.\n\nSee above at \u00b6 182.\n\n285.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's request to declare that the General Partner can claim damages only to the extent of its own Partnership Interest in 2015.\n\n**C. Respondent' preliminary objection that the General Partner's claim is legally deficient**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThis section addresses Respondent's second preliminary objection that as a matter of law, the General Partner's claim is not a claim for which an award in favour of the General Partner may be made under Article 11.26 of the FTA.319\n\nIn its Reply, Respondent has requested the Tribunal to \"dismiss the GP's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that \u2026 the GP's claim in respect of such portion is, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favor of the GP may be made under Article 11.20.6\" (Reply, \u00b6 121; emphasis added). The Tribunal understands this to refer to the wording of Article 11.20.6 of the FTA, according to which \"a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 11.26.\" (emphasis added).\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n287.\n\nRespondent contends that Article 11.16.1 of the FTA requires Claimants to have \"incurred loss or damage by reason of, arising out of, [a] breach [of the FTA].\"320 It follows, so argues Respondent, that the FTA does not allow Claimants to bring claims for losses allegedly suffered by third parties.321 According to Respondent, such requirement is consistent with international law.322\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 31.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 31.\n\nReply, \u00b6 109.\n\n288.\n\nRepeating its argument that the General Partner lacks beneficial ownership of the Samsung Shares, Respondent submits that the General Partner had no right to enjoy the economic benefits in the first place and, therefore, cannot have suffered any alleged damage.323 Respondent argues that any alleged loss incurred as a result of Respondent's conduct would have been the loss of the Cayman Fund as the beneficial owner of the Samsung Shares, just like any increase in the value of the shares would have accrued to the Cayman Fund only.324 Consequently, any award of damages in favour of the General Partner would result in an unjust enrichment of the latter.325\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 32-35, relying on *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009 (\"***Siag v. Egypt***\") [**RLA-8**], \u00b6\u00b6 582, 584; *Occidental Dissent* [**RLA-15**], \u00b6 161; Hanno Wehland, *Blue Bank International v. Venezuela: When Are Trust Assets Protected under International Investment Agreements* 34(6) J. Int'l Arb.

El Salvador* [**CLA-36**], \u00b6 108.\n\nReply, \u00b6 108.\n\nReply, \u00b6 108.\n\n290.\n\nRespondent criticizes Claimants' characterization of the standard of compensation established in the *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)* , noting that Claimants \"ignore[] the Permanent Court of Justice's statement in *Chorz\u00f3w* that one must 'exclud[e] from the damage to be estimated [any] injury resulting for third parties'\".329\n\nReply, \u00b6 111, citing *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)* , PCIJ, Series A No. 17, Decision on the Merits, 13 September 1928 (\"***Chorz\u00f3w***\") [**CLA-1**], p. 31; *Occidental Annulment* [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 291; *Siag v. Egypt* [**RLA-8**], \u00b6 582.\n\n291.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimants' argument that the General Partner may claim damages suffered by the Limited Partner given that any recovered amounts \"would be re-invested on the Cayman Fund's behalf, and thus potentially generate future benefits for the [General Partner].\"330 Respondent considers this argument to be flawed because it blurs the distinction between separate beneficial interests of the General Partner and the Limited Partner, which results in different economic losses.331 Additionally, the prospect of profiting from a third party's recovery of damages is not enough to circumvent the restriction that a claimant may recover damages only for its own losses.332\n\nReply, \u00b6 114.\n\nReply, \u00b6 114\n\nReply, \u00b6 114.\n\n292.\n\nRespondent also disagrees with Claimants' argument that the General Partner would not be unjustly enriched if it was awarded damages, because the award for damages \"would be held on the Cayman Fund's behalf in accordance with Cayman law and the Partnership Agreement.\"333 According to Respondent, any such arrangement under domestic law cannot circumvent the restrictions contained in Article 11.16.1(a) of the FTA and international law.334 Moreover, even if the General Partner were to hold an award on damages on trust for the Cayman Fund, that would only serve to show that the claim is brought on the Cayman Fund's, and not on the General Partner's, behalf.335\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 115-116, citing *Impregilo v. Pakistan* [**RLA-6**], \u00b6\u00b6 151-152.\n\nReply, \u00b6 117.\n\n293.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that the fact that the alleged breach of the FTA had \"other consequences\" for the General Partner, including for its right to participate in the meetings of the companies, is irrelevant to the General Partner's economic interest in the Samsung Shares and any alleged ensuing damages.336\n\nReply, \u00b6 118.\n\n**2. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n294.\n\nClaimants argue that the General Partner is entitled to compensation for Respondent's treaty violations in accordance with the *Chorz\u00f3w* standard pursuant to which all consequences of an internationally wrongful act must be wiped out.337 Claimants also assert that Respondent's objections under Article 11.20.6 of the FTA are based on \"limitations that have no place in the [FTA].\"338\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 100, citing *Chorz\u00f3w* [**CLA-1**], p. 47.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 93.\n\n295.\n\nAccording to Claimants, given the early stage of the proceedings, Respondent must meet an extremely high standard of proof, namely that the General Partners claims are \"demonstrably doomed to failure\", and \"legally hopeless\" and that Respondent's \"wrongful acts had no consequences for the General Partner (to be wiped out), and the General Partner's situation remained unaffected by those acts (with no need for that situation to be reestablished) \" even assuming the facts alleged by the General Partner to be true.339 Claimants assert that Respondent has failed to discharge this burden.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96-97, 101, referring to *Bridgestone v. Panama* [**CLA-28**], \u00b6 97; *The Renco Group. Inc. v. The Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Decision as to the Scope of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.4, 18 December 2014 ***(\"Renco Group v. Peru\")***  [**CLA-43**], \u00b6 206; *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* **[CLA-36]**, \u00b6 110; Rejoinder, \u00b6 122.\n\n296.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent's argument that the General Partner has no beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares is incorrect and recalls that the General Partner did have an indivisible beneficial interest over the assets of the partnership, including the Samsung Shares.340 According to Claimants, Respondent's wrongful acts \"affected the value of the Samsung Shares, and thus the General Partner's partnership interest, including the General Partner's entitlement to an incentive allocation.\"341\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 102.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 103, referring to First WS Garschina [**CWS-1**], \u00b6 11; First WS Satzinger [**CWS-2**], \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Rejoinder, \u00b6 124.\n\n297.\n\nEven if Respondent were successful in proving that the General Partner had no beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares, Claimants argue that Respondent has not proven (i) that \"damage to the value of the [Samsung] Shares nevertheless had no other consequences for the General Partner, including as the party bearing ultimate liability for the business in the event of insolvency\"; and (ii) that \"the damage to the General Partner's investment in the Samsung Shares had no consequences for the General Partner's legal and controlling interests in the [Samsung] Shares.\"342 Moreover, Claimants allege that the loss in value of the Samsung Shares resulted in potentially \"significant and material financial and reputational damage.\"343\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 104, referring to First ER Lindsay [**CER-1**], \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26, 32(c).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 124.\n\n298.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argue that Respondent failed to substantiate its assertion that an award on damages in favour of the General Partner would unjustly enrich the latter. Indeed, an award on damages to the General Partner would be held in the same way that the Samsung Shares originally were held and would therefore restore the position that existed but for Respondent's wrongful conduct.344\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 105.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nAt the outset of its analysis of Respondent's preliminary objection under Article 11.20.6 of the FTA, the Tribunal refers to the fact that other tribunals have been called upon ruling on preliminary objections under similarly worded investment treaties such as the Central American \u2013 Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (\"**CAFTA**\") and the United States \u2013 Peru Trade Promotion Agreement.345\n\n*Pac Rim v. El Salvador* [**CLA-36**]; *Renco Group v. Peru* **[CLA-43]**.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the remarks made by the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* tribunal on the standard of review as well as the Tribunal's discretion in ruling on such objections:\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the standard of review under Article 10.20.4 is limited to \"frivolous\" claims or \"legally impossible\" claims, contrary to the submissions of the Claimant \u2026\n\nThe Tribunal does consider that the word \"may\" in Article 10.20.4 (line 4) confers an important arbitral power in whether to grant or refuse a preliminary objection, to be exercised reasonably in all the circumstances of the particular case. The word \"may\" is not \"must\" or otherwise mandatory \u2026\n\nIn other words, returning to the negative language of Article 10.20.4, to grant a preliminary objection, a tribunal must have reached a position, both as to all relevant questions of law and all relevant alleged or undisputed facts, that an award should be made finally dismissing the claimant's claim at the very outset of the arbitration proceedings, without more. Depending on the particular circumstances of each case, there are many reasons why a tribunal might reasonably decide not to exercise such a power against a claimant, even where it considered that such a claim appeared likely (but not certain) to fail if assessed only at the time of the preliminary objection. (emphasis added)346\n\n*Pac Rim v. El Salvador* [**CLA-36**], \u00b6\u00b6 108-110.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its prior conclusion that it would be neither possible nor appropriate for it to decline jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner at the present stage of the proceedings given that this would involve making findings on issues of quantum that have not been fully pleaded.\n\n302.\n\nThe same considerations apply in the context of Respondent's legal deficiency objection under Article 11.20.6 of the FTA. To use the words of the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* tribunal, the Tribunal has not reached a position, both as to all relevant questions of law and all relevant alleged or undisputed facts, that an award should be made finally dismissing the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner at the very outset of the arbitration.\n\n303.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's request to dismiss the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that the General Partner's claim in respect of such portion is, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favour of the General Partner may be made under Article 11.26 of the FTA.\n\n**D. Costs of the preliminary phase**\n-------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nAs a final matter, the Tribunal turns to consider the issue of costs of this preliminary phase of the proceedings.\n\n305.\n\nBoth Parties have requested the Tribunal to order the other Party to bear the full costs of this preliminary phase.347\n\nReply, \u00b6 121; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 108.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal has discretion to award costs under Article 11.20.8 of the FTA, which provides:\n\nWhen it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 6 or 7, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n307.\n\nIn the present circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to award costs to any Party at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot award costs in favour of Respondent as it has not succeeded in its preliminary objections.\n\n309.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to award costs in favour of Claimants. That is for two reasons: first, Respondent's preliminary objections have not been frivolous; the fact that the Tribunal has postponed its decision on some of the issues shows that the preliminary objections have addressed crucial issues arising in the case; second, the Tribunal is of the view that many of the issues addressed in this preliminary phase will retain their relevance for the liability and quantum phase; the efforts and costs associated with this preliminary phase of the proceedings have therefore not been wasted.\n\n310.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal reserves its decision on costs for the final award.\n\n**VII. OPERATIVE PART**\n-----------------------\n\n311.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\na) **declares** that the General Partner owned and controlled the Samsung Shares and made an investment in accordance with Article 11.28 of the FTA; accordingly **rejects** Respondent's request for a declaration that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim on the basis that: (i) the General Partner has not made an investment in accordance with Article 11.28 of the FTA and/or (ii) the General Partner did not own or control the Samsung Shares; and **rejects** Respondent's request to dismiss all of the claims brought by the General Partner for that reason;\n\nb) **rejects** Respondent's application to dismiss, at this stage of the proceedings, the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that the General Partner lacks standing to submit claims on behalf of third parties under Article 11.16.1 of the FTA;\n\nc) **rejects** Respondent's request to dismiss the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that the General Partner's claim in respect of such portion is, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favour of the General Partner may be made under Article 11.26 of the FTA;\n\nd) **rejects** Respondent's request for a declaration that the General Partner can claim damages only to the extent of its own Partnership Interest in 2015;\n\ne) **rejects** Claimants' application for a declaration at this stage of the proceedings that the General Partner's claim is admissible and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over that claim;\n\nf) **reserves** its decision on the costs of this preliminary phase of the arbitration for the final award."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2024-04-11T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**Glossary of Defined

The Tribunal decided that it would not need any further clarifications from the Parties.\n\n37.\n\nOn 22 December 2019, the Tribunal notified the Parties that while the Tribunal had rendered and signed its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, it intended to defer the issuance of the Decision until the Korean translation became available by the end of January 2020, in accordance with the language requirements of Section 8.2 of the Terms of Appointment. The Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and seek agreement on whether to deviate from Section 8.2 of the Terms of Appointment, such that the Parties would obtain the Decision earlier, with the Korean translation to follow in due course.\n\n38.\n\nOn 24 January 2020, the Tribunal circulated to the Parties its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections dated 22 December 2019, in English and Korean. In the Decision, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n311. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) **declares** that the General Partner owned and controlled the Samsung Shares and made an investment in accordance with Article 11.28 of the FTA; accordingly rejects Respondent's request for a declaration that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the General Partner's claim on the basis that: (i) the General Partner has not made an investment in accordance with Article 11.28 of the FTA and/or (ii) the General Partner did not own or control the Samsung Shares; and rejects Respondent's request to dismiss all of the claims brought by the General Partner for that reason;\n\n(b) **rejects** Respondent's application to dismiss, at this stage of the proceedings, the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that the General Partner lacks standing to submit claims on behalf of third parties under Article 11.16.1 of the FTA;\n\n(c) **rejects** Respondent's request to dismiss the General Partner's claim for losses incurred by the Cayman Fund and the Limited Partner on the basis that the General Partner's claim in respect of such portion is, as a matter of law, not a claim for which an award in favor of the General Partner may be made under Article 11.26 of the FTA;\n\n(d) **rejects** Respondent's request for a declaration that the General Partner can claim damages only to the extent of its own Partnership Interest in 2015; (e) rejects Claimants' application for a declaration at this stage of the proceedings that the General Partner's claim is admissible and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over that claim;\n\n(f) **reserves** its decision on the costs of this preliminary phase of the arbitration for the final award.\n\n**C.

Claimants objected to this request on 16 November 2023.\n\n103.\n\nOn 17 November 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to deny Respondent's request because no exceptional circumstances justifying the late admission of this exhibit had been demonstrated and the request was belated.\n\n104.\n\nOn 21 November 2023, the Parties submitted their comments in response to the Tribunal's letter of 10 October 2023 (respectively, \"**Claimants' Comments on Quantum**\" and \"**Respondent's Comments on Quantum**\").\n\n105.\n\nOn 30 November 2023, Claimants wrote to the Tribunal in respect of the number of the SC&T shares held by Claimants on 16 July 2015 and confirmed that the Tribunal's calculation on the basis of the number of shares held as of 16 July 2015 in Claimants' trading records (Exhibit C-32) was correct.\n\n106.\n\nOn 7 December 2023, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had uploaded revised English translations for two judgments of the Seoul Central District Court and two judgments of the Seoul High Court.\n\n107.\n\nOn 10 January 2024, the Parties submitted updated cost submissions (respectively, \"**Claimants' Updated Costs Submissions**\" and \"**Respondent's Updated Costs Submissions**\") and Claimants notified the Tribunal of a change of their representatives.\n\n108.\n\nOn 15 February 2024, Respondent informed the Tribunal about the issuance of another judgment of the Seoul Central District Court on 5 February 2024 and requested that the Tribunal refrain from closing the proceedings until Respondent had obtained a copy of the judgment and sought leave from the Tribunal to admit it into the record. Claimants opposed this request on 16 February 2024, and Respondent provided further comments on 20 February 2024.\n\n109.\n\nAlso on 20 February 2024, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to deny the Respondent's request, because it did not consider the mere fact that a judgment was rendered after the final submissions in this arbitration to constitute exceptional circumstances which could justify the late admission of new documents, and declared the proceedings closed.\n\n**III.

For the avoidance of further doubt, an Incentive Allocation will be made with respect to a Capital Account for a partial calendar year due to an intra-year contribution, or in the event some or all amounts are voluntarily or mandatorily withdrawn from such Capital Account as of a date other than the end of a Fiscal Year. The General Partner, in its sole discretion, may reduce, waive or grant rebates with respect to the Incentive Allocations for certain Capital Accounts.15\n\nPartnership Agreement [**C-30**], Art. 4.06(b).\n\n117.\n\nClaimants consider that Respondent mischaracterizes their investment thesis, notably that they make \"hit and run\" investments with shareholder agitation and litigation.16 Claimants further deny Respondent's suggestion that they \"piggyback on investments\" made by another hedge fund, Elliott Associates L.P. (\"**Elliott**\") by profiting from the volatility generated by Elliott's activities.17\n\nFourth Witness Statement of Kenneth Garschina, 21 April 2021 (\"**Fourth WS Garschina**\") [CWS-7], \u00b6 6.

and (ii) overvaluing Samsung Biologics, Cheil's most important subsidiary, in order to inflate Cheil's value.199\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\n197.\n\nWith respect to the third benchmark ratio, in Claimants' view, the consistency of the NPS's analysis with other contemporaneous valuations is irrelevant because the NPS's calculations were \"the outcome of a corrupt, fraudulent, outcome-oriented process within the NPS\".200 In any event, Claimants argue that the contemporaneous analyses were \"based on data manipulated by Samsung and therefore are inherently flawed\".201\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\n198.\n\nHowever, according to Claimants, even measured against the NPS's final version of the benchmark ratio, the Merger was expected to cause a direct financial loss to the NPS of nearly KRWS 138.8 billion.202 CIO Hong attempted to address this issue by suggesting to JY Lee in a 7 July 2015 meeting that the Merger Ratio be adjusted to make it less unfavorable to SC&T shareholders, but JY Lee refused to accede to this request.203 Consequently, Claimants submit that CIO Hong directly ordered Mr. [REDACTED] (the Research Team) to fabricate the Merger synergy value in order to offset the NPS's expected loss from the Merger at the existing ratio, which the Seoul High Court found to be an \"active \u2026 breach of his duty\".204 Minister Moon also intervened and, in a \"criminal abuse of authority\", made Mr. [REDACTED] explain the Merger using the manipulated synergy value.205\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 93, referring to Seoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v.

Rejoinder, \u00b6 116.\n\n232.\n\nThird, in respect of the SK Merger, Respondent notes that it was the first time the NPSIM recommended that the Investment Committee refer a Merger vote to the Special Committee.283 The reason for such referral, according to Respondent, was not to set a \"procedural precedent\", but was done in the expectation that the Special Committee would establish \"clear criteria\" to guide the Investment Committee's determination on how to exercise voting rights in future matters concerning the restructuring of *chaebols*.284 In support of its contention, Respondent underscores that in all merger cases following the Merger, at least until the end of 2016, the Investment Committee did not refer a single matter to the Special Committee as it did in the SK Merger.285\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 150.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 150;

See also Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 53.\n\n236.\n\nFourth, Respondent submits that the outcome of the Investment Committee meeting was not predetermined as Claimants allege, as Mr. [REDACTED] drafted press releases for three possible outcomes (i.e., vote in favor of the Merger, vote against the Merger, and the referral of the matter to the Special Committee).293\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 118.\n\n237.\n\nFinally, referring to the Seoul Central District Court's decision on Elliott's injunction application to prevent the EGM from convening, Respondent asserts that the Court \"had already reviewed and cleared most of the controversial issues\" regarding the Merger, including the purpose of the Merger and the fairness of the Merger Ratio, that might have otherwise made it difficult to decide by the Investment Committee.294\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 129-132, referring to Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2015KaHab80582, 1 July 2015 [**R-177**], at 10-14.\n\n(3) The NPS's financial analyses reviewed by the Investment Committee were reasonable\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, Respondent submits that Claimants have not established that Minister Moon or any other Government official instructed CIO Hong or the NPS employees regarding the calculations of the benchmark ratio or the synergy valuations.295 Rather, the Korean courts have found that any instruction relating to the quantification of synergy effects would have come from CIO Hong alone.296 Therefore, Respondent submits that Claimants have not established that these financial analyses were carried out under Respondent's instructions.297\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 171;

NPSIM, \"Analysis Regarding the Merger of Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T,\" 10 July 2015 [**R-202**), pp. 44, 48.\n\n240.\n\nDenying that the two specific inputs in the NPS's calculation of the second benchmark ratio were manipulated, Respondent asserts that (i) the NPS applied an affiliate-company discount rate of 41% by reference to other holding companies in Korea, which was \"well within the range the market applied for valuation of such shares\"; and (ii) the valuation of Samsung Biologics were consistent with contemporaneous analyst valuations.300 Respondent further asserts that the calculations were based on \"reasonable inputs\" that were also consistent with the data that the NPS had compiled before the alleged pressure from the MHW or the Blue House occurred in late June.301\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 162.\n\n241.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimants' argument that the consistency of the NPS's analysis with other contemporaneous valuations is irrelevant because, in its view, \"the fact that different independent analysts arrived at different merger ratios, some of which were below and others above the NPS's ratio\" demonstrates that the calculation of an appropriate merger ratio is an \"imprecise science\", which can lead to varying results depending on the \"the subjective judgment of the person performing the valuation\", and that the NPS's ratio was in fact not unreasonable.302\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 164; Rejoinder, \u00b6 141.\n\n242.\n\nWith respect to the synergy effects, Respondent submits that the Research Team performed a \"sensitivity analysis\" to establish the synergy value that would be generated by various levels of sales increases in New SC&T and that there was nothing improper in that process.303 According to Respondent, the analysis by Mr. [REDACTED] required only one day because it was a \"simple mathematical calculation\".304 Respondent takes no view as to the correctness of the findings by the Korean courts that Mr. [REDACTED] relied\u2014without adequate support\u2014on certain projections and assumption regarding New SC&T in calculating the sales synergy effect.305\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 171;

Additional potential synergy effects presented to the Investment Committee include (i) estimated brand license fee of KRW 10 trillion that New SC&T would receive if it became the holding group of Samsung; (ii) the combined effects of the rise in SC&T's and Cheil's share prices due to the Merger; and (iii) the benefits of the merged entity of surfacing as the largest shareholder in fast-growing Samsung Biologics.

Dismiss all claims presented by Mason in this arbitration with prejudice;\n\nb. Award Korea all its costs associated with this arbitration, including legal fees and expenses, expert fees and expenses and its share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA; and\n\nc.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nAt the outset of its reasoning, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n288.\n\nArticle 11.1 of the FTA stipulates as follows in relation to its scope and coverage:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.1: SCOPE AND COVERAGE**\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of the other Party;\n\n(b) covered investments; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 11.8 and 11.10, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n...\n\n3. For purposes of this Chapter, **measures adopted or maintained by a Party** means measures adopted or maintained by\n\n(a) Central, regional, or local governments and authorities; and\n\n(b) Non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional, or local governments or authorities.404\n\nFTA [**CLA-23**], Art. 11.1.\n\n289.\n\nRespondent raises four objections to jurisdiction and admissibility: (A) the impugned acts of the NPS and Respondent do not constitute \"measures adopted or maintained\" by Respondent; (B) even if the impugned acts were \"measures\", they did not \"relate to\" Claimants; (C) the NPS' conduct, including the Merger vote, is not attributable to Respondent; (D) the National Treatment claim falls within the scope of Respondent's reservations under Article 11.12(2) of the FTA and is thus outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**A. Whether the impugned acts constitute \"measures adopted or maintained\" by Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n290.\n\nRespondent argues that \"none of the allegedly wrongful actions that underpin Claimants' claims constitute a 'measure adopted or maintained' by Korea, as required to implicate the Treaty's protections\".405 Respondent contends that Claimants' claims are based upon the alleged actions of President Park, Blue House officials, Minister Moon, and MHW officials to procure an affirmative vote for the merger, as well as CIO Hong's actions to effect an affirmative vote for the merger, and that \"none of this constitutes a 'measure' under the Treaty\".406\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 193.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 198.\n\n**a)** ***The proper interpretation of the term \"measure\"***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that the term \"measure\" is a broad, but limited, formulation under the Treaty, and it reflects a sovereign process of legislative or administrative rule-making and practice that is a final and official act of the State.407 Respondent therefore contends that that Claimants are required to show that the relevant State conduct is an exercise of sovereign authority.408\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 205; Rejoinder \u00b6 168.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 211.\n\n292.\n\nRespondent points to the Treaty definition of a \"measure\" as \"includ[ing] any law, regulation, procedure, requirement, or practice\".409 Respondent argues that \"a 'measure' refers to a formal outcome of a governmental process\", and \"anything short of an act carrying that formal quality is incapable of being, as the Treaty requires, 'adopted or maintained.'\"410\n\nStatement of Defense \u00b6 199, citing FTA [**CLA-23**], Art. 11.1(1).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 200.\n\n293.\n\nRespondent also contends that while Claimants argue that \"the Treaty's definition of 'measure' is not exhaustive \u2026 there is nothing inherent in the term 'include' in this context that connotes non-exhaustiveness\".411 Respondent therefore argues that the Treaty only stipulates that the measures explicitly listed should be treated as measures under the Treaty, and that the actions upon which Claimants rely do not meet this standard.412 Respondent notes the Korean version of the FTA, whereby the word \"*pohamhada*\" parallels the word \"includes\" and simply means to \"incorporate or put in together\".413\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 202.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 202.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 173.\n\n294.\n\nRespondent further asserts that the doctrines of *ejusem generis* and *noscitur a sociis*, whereby a term must be interpreted based on the listed examples, further confirms that a \"measure\" is a formal and official act.414 Interpreted in the context of government action, Respondent argues that the listed terms are not \"very broad\", as Claimants purport, but rather that each term \"connotes a formal and binding direction from the State\".415 Likewise, Respondent argues that the listed terms indicated in the Korean version of the FTA are also consistent with Respondent's reading of the ordinary meaning of the term \"measure\" in the context of government action.416\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 203.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n295.\n\nRespondent also points to the language of the Korean version of the FTA concerning the word \"measure\" (*jochi*), which refers to \"taking necessary steps after a careful examination\".417 Respondent argues that such usage of this word supports its conclusion that \"measures\" refers only to formal outcomes of government policies, \"reflect[ing] the systematic process of 'careful examination.'\"418\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 204, citing Standard Korean Language Dictionary (online), \"\uc870\uce58,\" accessed on 12 October 2020 [**R-334**].\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 204.\n\n296.\n\nRespondent is of the view that its interpretation of the term \"measure\" is supported by the immediate and greater context of the FTA. Respondent maintains that the immediate context of \"measure\" in Article 11.1 of the FTA requires it to be \"adopted or maintained\", terms which Respondent deems to only apply when a \"State's deliberative process is complete\".419 Reiterating that these terms must be analyzed in the context of government action, Respondent asserts that the term \"adopt\" implies a formal approval process and rejects Claimants' interpretation that a \"measure\" should not be read as representing the \"final culmination of a State's decision\".420\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 184.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 186.\n\n297.\n\nBeyond the immediate context of the term \"measure\", Respondent cites the use of \"measures\" in other sections of the FTA to support its interpretation.421 Respondent asserts that each of these uses \"signify[] only an act derived from a State's legislative or regulatory rule-making authority\".422\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 206, referring to FTA [**CLA-23**], Arts. 1.3, 2.8(1), 2.9(2)(b), 2.11, 3.3, 20.2, 20.3(1)(a)-(b).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 206.\n\n298.\n\nIn accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\"), Respondent also refers to the \"object and purpose\" of the FTA to support its argument regarding the meaning of \"measures\".423 Noting that the preamble cites a primary purpose of the FTA as \"establish[ing] clear and mutually advantageous rules\", Respondent asserts that the Treaty is not meant to regulate \"alleged conduct that lacks any hallmarks of State conduct\".424\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 169, citing VCLT [**CLA-161**], Art. 31(1).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 207.\n\n299.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants' interpretation is inconsistent with the Treaty's objective set out in the preamble to establish a \"stable and predictable environment for investment\" because it would render each inchoate act or expression of opinion by a State official a \"measure\" for the purposes of a Treaty claim.425 Respondent also asserts that Claimants' argument that Article 11.5 of the FTA would be rendered meaningless by Respondent's interpretation is incorrect since the decision of law enforcement authorities to intervene and protect property would in fact constitute a \"measure\".426\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 190, referring to Reply, \u00b6 110(a).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 193.\n\n300.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that by arguing that Korea cannot dispute that it is \"internationally responsible for conduct that is illegal or *ultra vires*\", Claimants have conflated the requirements under Articles 11.1(1) and 11.1(3), requiring the impugned conduct to be a \"measure\" and \"attributable to Korea\", respectively.427\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 191-192.\n\n301.\n\nRespondent argues that even if the Tribunal considers the Treaty to \"carry any ambiguity, the interpretive principle of *in dubio mitius* in international law counsels in favor of Korea's interpretation\".428 Respondent relies upon a number of legal authorities in the investment treaty context to support its argument that the term \"measure\" is limited.429 Respondent rejects Claimants' assertion that the legal authorities upon which it relies deal with entirely different propositions.430\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 208.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 209; citing *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004(\"***Waste Management v.

Judgement on Jurisdiction, 4 December 1998 [**CLA-112**] (noting the ICJ's analysis of the term \"measure\" \"in the context of Canada's reservation to the ICJ's jurisdiction\" renders this decision irrelevant\", and that the \"measures\" in that case were of a formal character); *Saluka v.

Mexico*, Respondent argues that expanding the term \"measures\" to cover such a transaction between commercial actors would improperly elevate ordinary transactions with public authorities into \"potential international disputes\".438 Respondent asserts that \"even accepting *arguendo* that the NPS is a public authority whose actions are attributable to Korea \u2026 the conduct at issue is a shareholder vote that the NPS took unilaterally, not a transaction entered into with Mason, let alone a governmental act applicable to society at large\".439\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 213.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 216.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 216, relying on *See* *Azinian and others v.

Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n313.\n\nClaimants submit that their claims in this dispute arise from measures \"adopted by the central government of Korea, through the combined actions of several of its constituent organs\", thus \"engag[ing] Korea's international responsibility pursuant to the Treaty\".455\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 115.\n\n**a)** ***The proper interpretation of the term \"measure\"***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nClaimants submit that the FTA's definition of \"measure\" is \"expansive, yet non-exhaustive\", covering \"the full gamut of 'government action,' including legislative, executive, administrative, judicial and other kinds of 'regulatory action.'\"456 Claimants argue that the ordinary meaning of the term, as supported in dictionary sources and the illustrative list in Article 1.4 of the FTA, is a \"generic\", \"broad\", \"inclusive\", and \"open-ended\".457 Claimants therefore reject Respondent's position that the term requires \"formal\" conduct.458\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 116-17, citing FTA [**CLA-23**], Annex 11-B, 3(b).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 9.

the FTA [**CLA-23**], Art. 20.2.\n\n319.\n\nClaimants contend that adopting a more restrictive definition of \"measures\" would render \"absurd and arbitrary results that are inconsistent with \u2026 the Treaty's object and purpose\".470 Claimants argue that it would create an incentive for states to formally treat investors equitably, while mistreating them through informal channels, and would also \"carve[] out a huge swathe of [state] conduct from the scope of its international responsibility\" as dictated by the International Law Commission's Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"**ILC Articles**\").471\n\nReply, \u00b6 110.\n\nReply, \u00b6 110, citing ILC Articles [**CLA-24**], Art. 7.\n\n320.\n\nClaimants also assert that Respondent's interpretation would undermine the Treaty's object and purpose to \"establish clear and mutually advantageous rules governing\u2026investment\" and to \"create a stable and predictable environment for investment\".472 Claimants argue that placing arbitrary distinctions between the types of actions regulated and not regulated by the Treaty undermine the Treaty's objective of clarity and that severely restricted the term \"measures\" impedes on the stability and predictability that the Treaty seeks to advance.473\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 19, citing FTA [**CLA-23**], Preamble.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n321.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants reject Respondent's suggestion that the meaning of \"measures adopted or maintained\" is necessitated by the \"democratic corrective roles\" executed by different governmental institutions.474 Claimants contend that measures taken by multiple State organs does not transform the nature of the act, and in this case, systems of control between State organs were used to facilitate the breach, rather than perform a corrective function.475\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\nReply, \u00b6 108.\n\n322.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that several substantive protections under the FTA would be rendered effectively meaningless with Respondent's restrictive definition of \"measures\" and provides examples that a breach of Articles 11.5 or 11.6 of the FTA would fall outside the scope of it.476 Claimants assert that the destruction or physical seizure of an investment prohibited by these Articles, respectively, are unlikely to be reflected in formal legislation, regulations, or decisions, and thus would be excluded from the Treaty's protection.477\n\nReply, \u00b6 111; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 23.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 23.\n\n323.\n\nClaimants also point to a number of legal authorities to support the principle that the term \"measures\" is meant to encompass any action or omission of the State.478 This includes an analysis of an identical provision found in Article 201 of North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\"), which Claimants contend supports their argument that the term \"measure\" is broad.479 Claimants also rely particularly tribunals constituted under the similar regimes to the FTA and NAFTA to claim that they came to the same definition of \"measure\".480\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 118-20, citing *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

U.S. submission**\n----------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe United States submits that Article 11.1.3(a) of the FTA confirms that measures adopted or maintained by a governmental body or authority of a Party are attributable to that Party and that there is no distinction based on the type of impugned conduct.489 The United States also argues that attribution to a non-governmental body, such as a state enterprise, can only be established if the impugned conduct is governmental in nature and \"the measures adopted or maintained by the non-governmental body are undertaken 'in the exercise of powers delegated by' the government or an authority of a Party\".490 The United States further states that pursuant to Article 16.9 of the FTA, this \"delegation\" can include \"a legislative grant, and a government order, directive, or other act, transferring to the \u2026 state enterprise, or authorizing the exercise by the \u2026 state enterprise of, governmental authority\".491 The United States concludes that, if the impugned conduct of the non-governmental body falls outside the scope of the delegation of authority, then this does not constitute a \"measure\" under Article 11.1 of the FTA.492\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 3, relying on ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 4, cmt. 6.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 4-5, relying on ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 5.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n**4. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the interpretation of the term \"measure\" found in Article 11.1 of the FTA before turning to the question of whether the impugned conduct of Respondent constitutes a measure within the meaning of the FTA.\n\n**a)** ***Interpretation of the term \"measure\"***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nIn accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal will begin its analysis with an assessment of the ordinary meaning of the term \"measure\".\n\n332.\n\nArticle 11.1(3) of the FTA provides that that for purposes of the investment chapter, \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party means measures adopted or maintained by: (a) central, regional, or local governments and authorities; and (b) non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional, or local governments or authorities\".\n\n333.\n\nArticle 1.4 of the FTA further defines the term \"measure\" as \"includ[ing] any law, regulation, procedure, requirement, or practice\".\n\n334.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the ordinary meaning of the term \"measure\", as defined in Articles 11.1(3) and 1.4 of the FTA, is sufficiently wide to encompass both formal and informal conduct of the host State, independent of whether it is the result of a sovereign process of legislative or administrative rule-making or practice.\n\n335.\n\n*First*, no limitation on the nature of host State conduct can be inferred from the term \"measure\" itself. The dictionaries relied upon by Respondent493 contain general, broad definitions of the term \"measure\" and do not suggest that the common understanding of the term is limited to the formal outcome of a governmental process.\n\nMerriam-Webster Dictionary, Definition of \"Measure\", accessed on 29 October 2020 [**R-325**] (\"a step planned or taken as a means to an end\"); Lexico (Oxford University) Dictionary, Definition of \"Measure\", accessed on 29 October 2020 [**R-323**] (\"a plan or course of action taken to achieve a particular purpose\"); Oxford English Dictionary, Definition of \"Measure\", accessed on 29 October 2020 [**R-329**] (\"a plan or course of action\").\n\n336.\n\n*Second*, as the verb \"to include\" makes clear, the list of examples provided in Article 1.4 of the FTA is not meant to be exhaustive. Yet even if it were or if one seeks to establish the meaning of the term \"measure\" by looking at the examples listed, their ordinary meaning does not suggest that informal or commercial conduct be excluded from the ambit of the Treaty. While the first two examples \u2013 laws and regulations \u2013 indeed refer to sovereign legislative or administrative rule-making processes, the examples \"procedure\", \"requirement\" or \"practice\" are generic terms that are used in different contexts and with different meanings and are not limited to the exercise of sovereign authority by the host State.\n\n337.\n\n*Third*, no other meaning can be derived from the addition in Article 11.1(3) of the FTA that measures are \"adopted or maintained\" by a Treaty party. In the Tribunal's view, the ordinary meaning of these two verbs is to clarify that both measures that have just been taken (\"adopted\") and measures that were taken some time ago but are still upheld (\"maintained\") fall within the scope of the Treaty.\n\n338.\n\nThis interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term \"measure\" is also in line with the jurisprudence of other international courts and tribunals. As the International Court of Justice (the \"**ICJ**\") observed in *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada),* \"in its ordinary sense the word [\"measure\"] is wide enough to cover any act, step or proceeding, and imposes no particular limit on their material content or the aim pursued thereby\".494\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada),* ICJ Judgment, 4 December 4 1998 **[CLA-112]**, \u00b6 66; see also *Saluka v. Czech Republic* [**CLA-41**], \u00b6 459; *Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13, Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum, 30 December 2016 [**CLA-137**], \u00b6 394.\n\n339.\n\nWhether or not commercial conduct can give rise to a Treaty violation might be an issue in the context of State attribution but there is no textual basis for outright excluding all conduct that could potentially be qualified as informal or commercial from the ambit of the Treaty.\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the term \"measure\" in the sense of Article 11.1 of the FTA comprises all acts or omissions by the host State. In the Tribunal's view, there are no indications in the text of the Treaty that the term \"measure\" is limited to a sovereign process of legislative or administrative rule-making and practice that is a final and official act of the State, as suggested by Respondent.\n\n341.\n\nThis definition also finds support in the Treaty's object and purpose (Article 31(1) VCLT). The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that limiting the term \"measures\" to formal conduct involving the exercise of sovereign authority would run counter to the Treaty's object and purpose. Otherwise, host States would be able to escape their obligations under the Treaty, such as the obligation to accord covered investments fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security under Article 11.5(1) of the FTA, by avoiding formal governmental decision-making processes and engaging in informal conduct.\n\n342.\n\nFurthermore, such a narrow reading of the term \"measure\" would conflict with the rules on State attribution. In that context, Respondent appears to accept that commercial conduct of a State organ can be attributed to the State under Article 11.1(3)(a) of the FTA495 (while, according to Respondent, it cannot be attributed in the case of non-governmental bodies496). Yet this distinction between sovereign and commercial acts in the context of State attribution would be rendered meaningless if one were to outright exclude all commercial conduct from the ambit of the Treaty.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 245 (stating that Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles provide a \"useful guide\" for the interpretation of Article 11.1.3 of the FTA \"for example, as to the dividing line between sovereign and commercial acts\").\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 281-285.\n\n343.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the term \"measure\" comprises both formal and informal acts or omissions of the host State, independent of whether they involve the exercise of sovereign authority.\n\n**b)** ***Qualification of Respondent's conduct***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the question of whether the impugned conduct of Respondent constitutes \"measures\" within the meaning of Article 11.1 of the FTA.\n\n345.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the following series of actions and steps constitute \"measures\" adopted by the relevant organ of the Korean government:497\n\n(a) The actions and steps taken by President Park and the officials at the Blue House to procure an affirmative Merger vote, including their directions to the MHW, a ministry organized under the Presidency, and MHW officials;\n\n(b) The actions and steps taken by Minister Moon and the officials at the MHW to procure an affirmative vote, including their directions to CIO Hong and NPS officials in the performance of their public duties;\n\n(c) The actions and steps taken by CIO Hong and the National Pension Service, including its officials' subversion of its proper processes, in order to effect an affirmative vote for the Merger and consummate the corrupt scheme.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 121.\n\n346.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent submits that the NPS vote in favor of the Merger was not a \"measure\" as it was a purely commercial act lacking any exercise of sovereign power.498 Furthermore, Respondent denies that any alleged Blue House, MHW, and NPS conduct before the Merger vote constitutes a \"measure\" under the Treaty as it merely involved the general pursuit of a policy initiative by certain individuals in the Korean executive and did not implicate any rule-making or enforcement authority.499\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 213.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 219.\n\n347.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's prior finding that \"measures\" need not involve the formal exercise of sovereign authority, and without prejudice to the issue of State attribution or the merits of the Treaty violations alleged by Claimants, the Tribunal considers that both the NPS vote in favor of the Merger and the conduct of officials at the Blue House, the MHW, and the NPS constitute \"measures adopted or maintained\" Respondent within the meaning of Article 11.1 of the FTA.\n\n348.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's jurisdictional objection that Claimants' claims are not based on \"measures adopted or maintained\" by Respondent.\n\n**B.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n349.\n\nRespondent argues that even if the Tribunal considers that the actions underlying Claimants' claims constitute a \"measure\" adopted by Korea, \"Mason has not proven that such measures 'relate[d] to' it, or to its investments in SC&T and SEC\".500 Respondent specifically submits that \"an act, when undertaken, does not 'relate to' a subject by virtue of the fact that the subject indirectly experiences consequences of the act at a later time\".501 Therefore, Respondent argues that because the NPS's Merger vote had only an indirect and consequential effect on Claimants' investment in SC&T and no effect whatsoever on Claimants' investment in SEC, the alleged measures should not be considered to \"relate to\" Claimants or their investments.502\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 194.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 224.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 224.\n\n350.\n\nRespondent contends that the requirement that a measure \"relates to\" an investor is intended to \"circumscrib[e] the otherwise limitless liability State parties would have to investors whose investments are incidentally or consequentially impacted by a State measure\".503 Respondent relies upon *Methanex v. United States* to support the principle that \"relating to\", at least in the context of NAFTA, \"signifies something more than the mere effect of a measure on an investor or an investment and \u2026 requires a legally significant connection between them\" (emphasis added by Respondent).504 Respondent also relies on the decision in *Dickson Car Wheel v. Mexico* to reject the assertion that a State can incur responsibility for every consequential or corollary effect of a State's actions.505 While it concedes that the words \"relating to\" in Article 11.1(1) of the Treaty require that there be a legally significant connection, Respondent submits that a legally significant connection must be more than just \"any\" connection.506\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 225.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 226, citing *Methanex Corporation v.

Canada* to argue that \"a measure which adversely affected the claimant in a tangential or merely consequential way will not\" satisfy NAFTA's \"relating to\" requirement.507 Based on this precedent as well as the U.S. Submission, Respondent submits that in order to meet the \"relating to\" requirement, its conduct must have had a legally significant connection to Claimants and their investment; a negative impact on Claimants alone will not meet the test.508 Respondent asserts that this requirement does not equate to Claimants' burden of establishing causation under Article 11.16(a)(ii) of the FTA.509\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 229, citing *Resolute Forest Products Inc. v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n369.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the general legal standard applying to the \"relating to\" requirement in Article 11.1(1) of the FTA is not in dispute. The Parties agree that the words \"relating to\" in Article 11.1(1) of the FTA require a \"legally significant connection\" between Respondent's measures and Claimants or their investments.560\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 128; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 4.\n\n370.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree on the meaning of this requirement. Whereas Respondent submits that a generic, negative impact of a measure is insufficient but there needs to be a \"relationship of apparent proximity\" or \"some specific impact\" of the alleged measures on the investor or the investment,561 Claimants take the view that the FTA does not introduce any additional requirement beyond showing a connection with the investor or investment that is not merely tangential.562\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 132.\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is common ground that the mere negative effect of a measure on an investor or an investment is insufficient to establish a legally significant connection. The Tribunal agrees with the *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada* tribunal in that \"a measure which adversely affected the claimant in a tangential or merely consequential way will not suffice for this purpose\".563 The Parties' disagreement centers on whether additional requirements need to be fulfilled for a legally significant connection.\n\n*Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018 [**RLA-167**], \u00b6 242.\n\n372.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, no such additional requirements can be derived from the ordinary meaning of the term \"relating to\". In their literal sense, the words \"relating to\" merely require that from an objective point of view, there is a connection between the measure and the investor or investment that is not merely coincidental. Article 11.1(1) of the FTA does not say that the measure needs to be directed or targeted at the investor or investment.564 Neither does it require any intent to cause harm.565\n\nSee also *Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018 [**RLA-167**], \u00b6 242.\n\nSee also *Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Judgment of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice \u2013 2010 ONSC 4656 [**CLA-214**], \u00b6 57.\n\n373.\n\nThis interpretation also corresponds to the Treaty's objective and purpose. On the one hand, as it was held by the *Methanex* tribunal, some meaning must be given to the term \"relating to\" as \"[a] threshold which could be surmounted by an indeterminate class of investors making a claim alleging loss is no threshold at all\".566 The *Methanex* tribunal further noted that while the \"possible consequences of human conduct are infinite, especially when comprising acts of governmental agencies\", at some point a \"limit is necessarily imposed restricting the consequences for which that conduct is to be held accountable\".567 Building on this jurisprudence, the Tribunal determines the purpose of the \"relating to\" requirement in Article 11.1(1) of the FTA to be a first jurisdictional filter that puts a limit on the vast amount of consequences which State conduct can have on investors or investments and for which investors can hold the host State accountable under the Treaty. In the Tribunal's view, this is predominantly a factual question that is separate from the legal issue of State attribution.\n\n*Methanex v. US* [**RLA-92**], \u00b6 137.\n\n*Methanex v. US* [**RLA-92**], \u00b6 138.\n\n374.\n\nOn the other hand, its legal nature as a jurisdictional gateway implies that this test is different from the factual or legal causation requirements that the Treaty sets forth in Article 11.16(1)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii). The Tribunal agrees with the *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada* tribunal that the \"substantive requirements of causation should be analyzed when deciding on the merits\".568 Consequently, whether a measure of the host State was the proximate cause of the loss to the investor's investment is a question that the Tribunal believes should be reserved for the merits. At the jurisdictional stage, it suffices to show that the effect of the measure on the investor or investment was not merely tangential or coincidental.\n\n*Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018 [**RLA-167**], \u00b6 242.\n\n375.\n\nEventually, as the *Methanex* tribunal explained and the United States also pointed out in their non-disputing Party submission, whether there is a legally significant connection can only be decided based on the particular facts of each case.569\n\n*Methanex v. US* [**RLA-92**], \u00b6 139; U.S. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n376.\n\nFor its inquiry into whether the jurisdictional requirement of a legally significant connection is met, the Tribunal agrees with the *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada* tribunal in that it \"should ordinarily accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged\".570 The Tribunal notes that the Parties' submissions on the \"relating to\" requirements are closely linked to the merits of the dispute. Both Claimants and Respondent refer to their substantive arguments as to why Respondent's conduct did or did not breach the Treaty's standards of protection in seeking to establish or to rebut a legally significant connection under Article 11.1(1) of the FTA. In the Tribunal's view, this approach conflates jurisdictional and substantive issues (and is another reason why the bar for a legally significant connection under Article 11.1(1) of the FTA must not be set too high). If the Tribunal were required to engage in a full factual inquiry into Claimants' allegations and Respondent's Defenses to ascertain its jurisdiction, this would anticipate the merits of the dispute and the substantive question of whether any Treaty violations occurred. Consequently, the Tribunal is of the view that its jurisdictional review must necessarily be limited to the question whether the facts as alleged by Claimants establish a legally significant connection between Respondent's contested measures and Claimants' investment.\n\n*Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018 [**RLA-167**], \u00b6 242.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Claimants have met this threshold in the present case. If one accepts the facts as alleged by Claimants, Respondent interfered with the Merger vote specifically for the purpose of benefitting the Lee Family which came at the expense of other shareholders in SC&T. On Claimants' account of facts, the approval of the Merger with a Merger Ratio unfair to SC&T shareholders, which would not have occurred but for Respondent's illicit interference in the NPS' voting process, extracted billions of dollars of value from SC&T's shareholders and transferred them to the Lee Family and Cheil's other shareholders.\n\n378.\n\nAssuming that this was the case, Respondent's measures affected Claimants in more than just a tangential or coincidental way. At the time of the Merger vote, Claimants were minority shareholders in SC&T and co-shareholders with the NPS. The NPS' vote on the Merger, and Respondent's alleged interference with its voting process, had a direct impact on Claimants' investment in SC&T, independent of whether the NPS was required, under its own guidelines or under Korean law, to take the interests of minority shareholders into account when exercising its voting rights (which the Tribunal does not consider decisive in this context).\n\n379.\n\nThe case might have been different if, say, the Merger vote had incidentally affected the stock prices of other companies listed on the Korean stock exchange but not affiliated with the Samsung Group, and if their shareholders had somehow felt harmed by the Korean government's actions. In that instance, the required link between the impugned measures and the investors might have been broken. In the present case, however, Claimants' allegation is that they were directly affected by Respondent's interference in the Merger vote as minority shareholders in SC&T, as a result of which the Tribunal concludes that there is a legally significant connection between Respondent's measures and Claimants' investment in SC&T.\n\n380.\n\nFor this purpose, the Tribunal considers it irrelevant whether Respondent intended to cause harm to foreign shareholders in SC&T, including Claimants, or specifically targeted them. As the Tribunal has already established, neither is necessary to establish a legally significant relationship. Rather, it suffices to state that, on Claimants' account of facts, Respondent's preferential treatment of the Lee Family (and other Cheil shareholders) inevitably disadvantaged and directly impacted the SC&T shareholders including Claimants.\n\n381.\n\nThe Tribunal is further satisfied that there is also a legally significant connection between Respondent's measures and Claimants' investment in SEC. According to Claimants, SC&T's main asset was its stake in SEC. While SEC was not part of the Merger, it also forms part of the Samsung Group and, as alleged by Claimants, its share price was negatively affected by the lack of corporate governance within the Samsung Group exhibited during the Merger approval.571 Whether this was actually the case is a question for the merits that the Tribunal will return to in the context of legal causation and quantum. At this jurisdictional juncture, it suffices to state that the facts as alleged by Claimants establish a sufficient nexus between Respondent's measures and Claimants' investment in SEC that is not merely tangential or coincidental.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 190.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the class of potential investors making a claim is indeterminate. The shareholders in SC&T and SEC, which are both publicly traded companies, are readily identifiable and, as such, form a determinate group of investors. The only remaining question is whether, in view of the large number of shareholders in the two companies, one considers the class of potential investors as too large and equates this with indeterminate. In principle, the Tribunal agrees with the rule of thumb suggested by Respondent that the larger the purportedly ascertainable class, the more likely it is that there is no legally significant connection. However, in the present case, \"shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise\" are expressly listed as protected investments in Article 11.28 of the FTA. It is inherent to publicly listed companies that their shares are often traded by a large number of shareholders. In the Tribunal's view, it would be irreconcilable with the Treaty's definition of investment and its object and purpose to exclude shareholders of a company from the Treaty's ambit solely on the basis of their quantity. Consequently, the fact that the class of potential investors presently comprises many individual claimants does not suffice to break the line between the impugned measures and the investors.\n\n383.\n\nNo other conclusion can be drawn from the fact that domestic investors in SC&T and SEC were equally affected by the measures. Article 11.1(1) of the FTA does not require that a measure only relates to foreign investors or investments.\n\n384.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's jurisdictional objection that the impugned measures of Respondent do not relate to Claimants or their investment in the sense of Article 11.1(1) of the FTA.\n\n**C.

Oman* tribunal's interpretation of Article 10.1.2 of the U.S.-Oman FTA, which set forth rules on attribution, noting that it \"held such treaty provision displaced principles of attribution under customary international law\".577 Similarly, Respondent refers to *UPS v. Canada*, noting that the tribunal held that because \"Chapter 15 of NAFTA provides for 'a *lex specialis* regime in relation to the attribution of acts of monopolies and state enterprises \u2026 the customary international law rules reflected in article 4 of the ILC text do not apply \u2026\".578\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 298.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 242, citing *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v.

Finally, Respondent contends that the NPS is not a \"central administrative agency\" established for \"specific administrative purposes\".

Respondent contends that \"[t]he only common feature Mason identifies between these entities is their classification as 'fund-management-type quasi-governmental institutions' under the Korean Public Institutions Act\", and that this designation is \"irrelevant to the question of whether each entity is a State organ under Korean law\".617\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 270.\n\n403.\n\nRespondent also contends that whether the NPS might \"successfully claim sovereign immunity under a different legal order \u2026 is wholly irrelevant\" to whether the NPS is a *de jure* State organ.618 Respondent specifically presents the conclusion of the tribunal in *Dayyani v.

First, while \"Korean law does not specify which entities are 'state organs'\", Claimants point to the Commentaries to the ILC Articles, which state that \"the reference to a State organ in article 4 is intended in the most general sense\".674 Claimants assert that \"Article 4 is ultimately concerned with the *reality* of any given situation alleged to involve internationally wrongful State conduct\" rather than the formalistic definition.675 Along these lines, Claimants contend that \"the position of internal law as to whether or not an entity is an 'organ' has only very limited relevance\".676 Claimants contend that domestic law is only relevant in \"two stages\": the first stage concerns whether domestic law characterizes particular entities as \"State organ\" and the second stage concerns \"whether the structural and functional legal characteristics of an entity qualify it as a State organ\".677\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 134, citing Commentaries on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 4, cmt. 6.\n\nReply, \u00b6 148, citing Csaba Kov\u00e1cs, ATTRIBUTION IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (2018) [**RLA-171**], p. 2.\n\nReply, \u00b6 150.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 57.\n\n426.\n\nClaimants question the veracity of Professor Kim Sung-soo's conclusions in his expert report regarding the importance of internal Korean law to the NPS's status as a State organ.678 Claimants assert that \"Korean law does \"not classify, exhaustively or at all, which entities have the status of 'organs'\", and thus it is more relevant to consider \"the NPS's structural and functional characteristics under Korean law\" or the above-noted second stage.679 Claimants contend that there is in fact a huge diversity of administrative agencies within the Korean State apparatus.680 Claimants thus argue that Professor Kim's finding that \"Korean law explicitly defines what entities are considered 'organs' for the purposes of international law\" actually \"critically misstates the position\"681 and that his reference to the concept of \"*guk-ga-gi-gwan*\" has no authoritative support.682 Moreover, Claimants attack the independence of Professor Kim over his longstanding ties to the Korean government.683\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 153-57 (noting \"Prof. Kim's patent lack of independence from the government of Korea\").\n\nReply, \u00b6 154.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59, referring to Second ER SS Kim, \u00b6 18.\n\nReply, \u00b6 154, citing First ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 11.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 58, referring to Second ER SS Kim, \u00b6 12.\n\nReply, \u00b6 153.\n\n427.\n\nAs to the relevance of internal law in the \"second stage\", Claimants contend that \"it is clear from a structural perspective that the NPS is a part of the central government within the meaning of Article 11.3(a) of the FTA\".684 In particular, Claimants note that: \"[t]he NPS's purpose, functions and powers derive exclusively from the National Pension Act, from other legislation that entrusts matters to the NPS, and from delegations by the Minister of Health and Welfare in accordance with the National Pension Act\";685 the chief executive of the NPS serves at the will of the President of Korea, and \"sits on the NPS board, alongside directors appointed by the Minister of Health and Welfare, and a government official in charge of National Pension affairs at the Ministry\";686 the MHW \"approves the appointment of the NPS CIO\";687 \"CIO Hong and other officials of the NPS are considered 'public officials' or 'government employees' under the Korean Criminal Act\";688 \"[t]he Minister of Health and Welfare is required to approve any amendments to the NPS's articles of incorporation which set forth internal regulations or guidelines\", can \"order changes to be made\", and \"is required to approve the NPS's business operation plan and budget\";689 \"[t]he functions performed by the NPS are fundamentally state functions, as recognized in the Korean constitution, and the Government Organization Act\";690 \"[t]he NPS has no independent commercial purpose or functions\" and \"no independent or commercial source of revenue\";691 and like other State organs, \"the NPS is subject to Korean administrative law, including the Petition Act, the Administrative Appeals Act, and the Administrative Litigation Act\".692\n\nReply, \u00b6 158, citing Commentaries on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 4, cmt. 11. *See also* Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 61.

Power v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n455.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that Respondent presents its arguments on State attribution as an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Respondent argues that \"[t]o establish this Tribunal's jurisdiction, Mason bears the burden of proving that the conduct it complains of is attributable to Korea\".763 Claimants do not contest this categorization as a jurisdictional issue.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 235.\n\n456.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the issue of State attribution relates both to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute.764 Insofar as the impugned measures cannot be attributed to the host State, they were not adopted or maintained by a Party within the meaning of Article 11.1.3 of the FTA and cannot form the basis of a claim under Article 11.16 of the FTA. In respect of such measures, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\nSee also *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Award, 10 March 2014 [**RLA-225**], \u00b6 276.\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Respondent's jurisdictional objection is limited to the conduct of the NPS and its employees which, according to Respondent, is not attributable to it. Respondent does not object to the attribution of the impugned conduct of the Blue House, President Park, and her subordinates, as well as the impugned conduct of the MHW, Minister Moon, and his subordinates.765 It is undisputed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over their conduct pursuant to Article 11.1(3)(a) of the FTA.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, 21 March 2022, pp. 206:20-207:4 (Respondent's Opening Submission).\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal's further analysis of the issue of State attribution is structured as follows: the Tribunal will first discuss the applicable legal standard before addressing the questions of whether the conduct of the NPS or its employees can be attributed to Respondent under Article 11.1.3(a) or (b) of the FTA and ILC Article 8.\n\n**a)** ***The applicable standard***\n------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether Article 11.1.3 of the FTA exhaustively sets out the grounds for State attribution and excludes the application of ILC Article 8 as *lex specialis*.\n\n460.\n\nArticle 11.22(1) of the FTA stipulates that the Tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules of international law. Contrary to what has been suggested by Claimants, this does not mean that the relevant starting point for its analysis on State attribution is the customary international law of State responsibility. Rather, the Tribunal considers that it should first look to the Treaty to establish whether its rules exclusively and exhaustively govern the issue of State attribution before turning to other applicable rules of international law.\n\n461.\n\nIn similar vein, the *Al Tamimi* tribunal began its analysis on State attribution with the U.S.-Oman FTA holding that \"contracting parties to a treaty may, by specific provision (*lex specialis*), limit the circumstances under which the acts of an entity will be attributed to the State\" and in that event \"any broader principles of State responsibility under customary international law or as represented in the ILC Articles cannot be directly relevant\".766\n\n*Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22, Award, 3 November 2015 [**RLA-156**], \u00b6 321.\n\n462.\n\nEven if one were to choose the ILC Articles as the starting point, ILC Article 55 provides that the ILC Articles do not apply where and to the extent that the conditions for the existence of an internationally wrongful act or the content or implementation of the international responsibility of a State are governed by special rules of international law. In this case, the Tribunal would equally have to first assess whether Article 11.1.3 of the FTA is a special rule of international law which excludes the application of the general principles of State attribution set forth in the ILC Articles.\n\n463.\n\nArticle 11.1.3 of the FTA deals with State attribution and sets out two grounds for attribution of measures adopted or maintained by (a) central, regional or local governments and authorities and (b) non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional or local governments or authorities. Based on the provision's ordinary meaning, these two instances are the sole grounds for State attribution under the Treaty, thereby excluding the application of the ILC Articles insofar as they provide for broader attribution. The wording of Article 11.1(3) of the FTA is formulated in such way that it can only be understood as an exhaustive and self-contained list of the grounds for State attribution.\n\n464.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Claimants' suggestion that there needs to be a discernible intention in the Treaty language to exclude the application of other principles of customary international law. Rather, it suffices to state that the issue of State attribution is comprehensively and exhaustively dealt with in Article 11.1(3) of the FTA and that the wording does not contain any indication that the list of grounds was meant to be exemplary and other grounds for State attribution from customary international law should be applicable in parallel. Understanding Article 11.1(3)(a) and (b) of the FTA as mere examples would also be difficult to reconcile with the general object and purpose of Article 11.1 of the FTA which sets out the scope of application of the investment in a comprehensive and exhaustive manner.\n\n465.\n\nThis does not mean that the interpretation of Article 11.1(3) of the FTA may not be guided by the ILC Articles to the extent that they correspond to each other. In fact, Article 11.1(3)(a) of the FTA closely mirrors ILC Article 4 and Article 11.1(3)(b) of the FTA closely mirrors ILC Article 5. However, there is no provision in the FTA corresponding to ILC Article 8 which permits the attribution of the conduct of a person or a group of persons if they are acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control, of the State in carrying out the conduct. In this respect, the Tribunal considers that there is an actual inconsistency between the Treaty and the ILC Articles as the latter provide for broader circumstances under which the acts of a non-governmental entity can be attributed to the State.\n\n466.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides that Article 11.1(3) of the FTA is a special rule which exhaustively deals with the issue State attribution for the purposes of the Treaty and thereby excludes the application of ILC Article 8.\n\n**b)** ***Whether the conduct of the NPS or its employees is attributable to Respondent under Article 11.1.3(a) of the FTA***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nUnder Article 11.1(3)(a) of the FTA, the conduct of the NPS and its employees can be attributed to Respondent if the NPS qualifies as a central, regional or local government or authority.\n\n468.\n\nWhile the Parties disagree on the relationship of Article 11.1(3) of the FTA and the ILC Articles, they at least agree insofar as ILC Article 4, and the respective commentary on the ILC Articles, can guide the interpretation of Article 11.1(3)(a) of the FTA which deals with the attribution of measures of State organs.767\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 127; Reply, \u00b6 148; Statement of Defense, \u00b6 251.\n\n469.\n\nILC Article 4(2) provides that a State organ \"includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State\". In line with that, the Tribunal will begin its analysis by examining whether the NPS qualifies as a State organ according to the internal law of the Republic of Korea, i.e., whether the entity is a *de jure* State organ.\n\n(1) Whether the NPS qualifies as a *de jure* State organ\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nTo recall, Respondent submits that firstly, the NPS is not a State organ according to Korean domestic law768 and secondly, the NPS's separate legal personality precludes it from further being classified as a *de jure* State organ.769\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 244 et seq.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 248 et seq.\n\n471.\n\nAs regards the first point, Claimants deny that Korean law conceptualizes or classifies the entities that constitute State organs.770 In respect of the second point, Claimants submit that the separate legal personality is only one factor to be taken into account in a wider analysis of the structural and functional legal characteristics of an entity.771\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 58.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that domestic law is critical in determining whether an entity qualifies as a *de facto* State organ. The Tribunal is further of the view that the first step of such analysis is to determine whether domestic law recognizes the concept of State organs. This view finds support in the ILC Commentaries which provide that \"[w]here the law of a State characterizes an entity as an organ, no difficulty will arise\".772\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles (2001) [**CLA-166**], Art. 4, cmt. 11.\n\n473.\n\nProfessor Kim, who is a professor of law at Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea specializing in Korean administrative law and who was presented as a legal expert by Respondent, testified on the classification of State organs under Korean law and the legal status of the NPS under Korean administrative law. Claimants did not present their own legal expert on Korean administrative law.\n\n474.\n\nBefore going into the details of Professor Kim's expert testimony, the Tribunal notes that it does not share Claimants' concerns about the independence of Professor Kim. While Professor Kim, as he disclosed in his expert reports, currently serves on a government committee on water resources management and has served on other government committees and advisory boards in the past, the Tribunal is of the view that this does not affect his independence as a legal expert. Likewise, the Tribunal does not view the circumstance that Professor Kim also appears as legal expert in another investment arbitration against Respondent as affecting his independence as a legal expert in this arbitration.\n\n475.\n\nProfessor Kim suggested in his expert reports and at the Hearing that Korean law distinguishes between three categories of State organs: (i) State organs that are constitutional institutions; (ii) State organs that are established under the Government Organization Act and other Acts enacted pursuant to Korea's Constitution; and (iii) State organs that are specifically established as \"central administrative agencies\" by other individual statutes.773 According to Professor Kim, State organs in Korea are \"established explicitly either by the Constitution, through specific legislation, or through subordinate regulations\" and cannot be established otherwise.774\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 11; Second ER SS Kim [**RER-5**], \u00b6 12; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, 22 March 2022, pp. 390:15-392:17 [Cross-examination of SS Kim].\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 16.\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the fact that there is no express statutory definition of State organs in the Korean Constitution or in other statutes. However, in the Tribunal's view, this does not necessarily mean that Korean law does not (at least implicitly) recognize the concept of State organs. Professor Kim has derived three categories of State organs from a thorough analysis of Korean statues, in particular the Constitution and the Government Organization Act. The Tribunal takes the view that the categorization suggested by Professor Kim may assist it in its analysis of the legal status of the NPS under Korean law.\n\n477.\n\nConstitutional institutions are, as Professor Kim explained, directly established under the Korean Constitution and include the National Assembly, the President, the Prime Minister, and the Courts.775 It is undisputed that the NPS is not established by or even referenced in the Korean Constitution. The NPS therefore does not fall within the first category of constitutional institutions.\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 12.\n\n478.\n\nIn respect of the second category, Professor Kim explained that the Government Organization Act establishes a number of key institutions which are called \"central administrative agencies\".776 Under the Government Organization Act, there are three categories of central administrative agencies: (i) ministries affiliated to the President *(Bu)*; (ii) ministries affiliated to the Prime Minister *(Cheo);* and (iii) agencies *(Cheong)* established under the control of a *Bu.* This follows from Article 2(2) of the Government Organization Act. According to Professor Kim, all of these types of central administrative agencies are considered State organs under Korean law.777 The MHW is an example of a *Bu,* and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency is an example of a *Cheong* under the MHW as it is expressly established under Article 38(2) of the Government Organization Act.778\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 14.\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 18.\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 20.\n\n479.\n\nThere are also central administrative agencies which are established by other statutes. They form the third category of State organs in Professor Kim's categorization. This group of central administrative agencies has in common that they need to be expressly established and designated as such in the respective statute (cf. Article 2(2) of the Government Organization Act). One example of such a central administrative agency established by another statute is the Financial Services Commission which is established under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister pursuant to Articles 3(1) and 3(2) of the Act on the Establishment and Operation of the Korean Financial Services Commission provides that the Financial Services Commission.779\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n480.\n\nAccording to Professor Kim, the NPS is not a central administrative agency and does not fall within the second or third category of State organs. It is not a *Cheong* as it is not established by the Government Organization Act.780 Neither is the NPS a central administrative agency by virtue of another statute. Notably, the National Pension Act does not establish or designate it as such.781\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6\u00b6 20, 39.\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 40.\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that in addition to the three above-mentioned categories of State organs, there exist other categories of administrative entities under Korean law that would also qualify as State organs. Notably, while the NPS is a public institution under the Act on the Management of Public Institutions, the Tribunal is not satisfied that this suffices for it to qualify as a State organ under Korean law. As Professor Kim explained, the designation of an entity as \"public institution\" merely means that it carries out duties of a public nature. Nevertheless, public institutions include for-profit companies which, for example, operate casinos.782\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 24.\n\n482.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the NPS does not fall within any of the categories of State organs that can be derived from Korean law.\n\n483.\n\nEven if one were to take the view that Korean law does not recognize the concept of State organs, an analysis of the structural and functional characteristics of the NPS would not lead to a different result.\n\n484.\n\nIt is undisputed that under Korean law, the NPS has separate legal personality. Neither is it in dispute that a separate legal personality of an entity is not dispositive when determining its status as a potential *de facto* State organ. However, the Parties disagree on the relevance of this circumstance for the qualification of an entity as *de jure* State organ.\n\n485.\n\nHaving reviewed the jurisprudence cited by the Parties that dealt with the question specifically in the context of *de jure* State organs, the Tribunal considers that most investment tribunals have taken the view that independent legal personality prevents an entity from qualifying as a *de jure* State organ. The existing jurisprudence has been summarized by the tribunal in *Alm\u00e5s v. Poland* in the following terms:783\n\n\"*[T]ribunals have determined that an entity is not a State organ according to the terms of a State's legal order when it has independent personality in that order. For example, in* Bayindir v. Pakistan*, the tribunal rejected the claim that Pakistan's National Highway Authority was a State organ, because of its separate domestic legal personality. In* EDF (Services) Ltd. v. Romania*, the tribunal similarly determined than an airport holding company and a State airline, 'both possessing legal personality under Romanian law separate and distinct from that of the State', were not State organs. Similarly, the tribunal in* Hamester v. Ghana *concluded that the Ghanaian Cocoa Board could not be considered to be a State organ in the sense of Article 4 of the ILC Articles, mainly because it was 'not classified a State organ under Ghanaian law, but [had been] created as a* \"*corporate body,*\" *which [could] be* \"*sued in its corporate name*\"*.*\n\n*Kristian Alm\u00e5s and Geir Alm\u00e5s v. The Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 27 June 2016 [**RLA-161]** \u00b6 208.\n\n486.\n\nOn that basis, the *Alm\u00e5s v. Poland* tribunal decided that an entity that \"has separate legal personality and exercises operational autonomy\" cannot be considered a *de jure* State organ even though the entity was supervised by a minister.784\n\n*Kristian Alm\u00e5s and Geir Alm\u00e5s v. The Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 27 June 2016 [**RLA-161]** \u00b6 209.\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this analysis. When an entity has a separate legal personality, especially when it is established according to the provisions of civil law, this indicates that the entity does not form an integral part of the organization of the State itself in such way that it can be considered a State organ.\n\n488.\n\nPursuant to Article 26 of the National Pension Act, the NPS shall be a corporation. It is thus established as a separate legal entity. Furthermore, by virtue of Article 48 of the National Pension Act, the provisions of the Korean Civil Act on incorporated foundations apply to the NPS *mutatis mutandis* except as provided otherwise in this Act. As Professor Kim explained in his expert reports, the NPS is thus governed by civil law and has the ability to acquire and hold property in its own name and may sue and be sued in its own name.785\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 74; Second ER SS Kim [**RER-5**], \u00b6 40.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that there are several links between the NPS and the Korean government which it will address in detail in the context of the question whether the NPS constitutes a *de facto* State organ. In respect of *de jure* State organs, it suffices to say that these links do not affect the legal independence of the NPS under Korean law. If factual dependence of the State were a relevant circumstance for determining a *de jure* State organ, this would render the distinction between *de jure* and *de facto* State organs moot.\n\n490.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that no relevant inferences can be drawn from a comparison with the KAMCO, the KDIC and the FSS. While the Tribunal has not been provided with the *Dayyani v. Korea* award*,* it understands from public reports that the tribunal relied on statements made by a KAMCO representative before the U.S. courts on sovereign immunity. In the present case, no such representations in respect of the NPS have been made. In any event, the issue of sovereign immunity under U.S. law is different from the present question about the legal status of the NPS under Korean law. The Tribunal is of the view that such representations before the U.S. courts would not be directly relevant to this issue.\n\n491.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the NPS does not qualify as a *de jure* State organ.\n\n(2) Whether the NPS qualifies as a *de facto* State organ\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the question of whether the NPS, regardless of its classification under national law, classifies as a *de facto* State organ in international law.\n\n493.\n\nThe Parties equally rely on the legal standard established by the ICJ in the *Bosnian Genocide* case:786\n\n\"*[P]ersons, groups of persons or entities may, for purposes of international responsibility, be equated with State organs even if that status does not follow from internal law, provided that in fact the persons, groups or entities act in 'complete dependence*' *on the State, of which they are ultimately merely the instrument. In such a case, it is appropriate to look beyond legal status alone, in order to grasp the reality of the relationship between the person taking action, and the State to which he is so closely attached as to appear to be nothing more than its agent: any other solution would allow States to escape their international responsibility by choosing to act through persons or entities whose supposed independence would be purely fictitious\".*\n\n*Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro)*, I.C.J. Judgment, 26 February 2007 [**RLA-105]** \u00b6\u00b6 392-393; see Reply, \u00b6 175; Rejoinder, \u00b6 258.\n\n494.\n\nThe relevant test is thus whether the entity is completely dependent on the State.787\n\nOne of the arbitrators is not convinced that complete dependency is required but takes the view that one needs to look at the individual act.\n\n495.\n\nIn applying this test, the *Alm\u00e5s v. Poland* tribunal considered factors such as \"the performance of core governmental functions, direct day-to-day subordination to central government, or lack of all operational autonomy\" as relevant, while noting that the criteria for a *de facto* State are not met \"where an entity engages on its own account in commercial transactions, even if these are important to the national economy\".788 In a similar vein, the *Union Fenosa v. Egypt* tribunal found that the designation as \"public authority\", the implication of public concerns or some governmental oversight by the State are not dispositive of a *de facto* State organ.789\n\n*Kristian Alm\u00e5s and Geir Alm\u00e5s v. The Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 27 June 2016 [**RLA-161]** \u00b6\u00b6 207, 210.\n\n*Union Fenosa Gas, S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4, Award of the Tribunal, 31 August 2018 [**CLA-145**] \u00b6 9.99.\n\n496.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal (by a majority) is not satisfied that the NPS meets the criteria of a *de facto* State organ.\n\n497.\n\nWhile the NPS is established by and its powers derive from government legislation (the National Pension Act), this does not show that it is completely dependent on the Korean State. Rather, the National Pension Act affords the NPS a considerable level of autonomy from the government: as previously stated, the NPS is established as a corporation according to civil law and can acquire property, sign contracts and be party to litigation in its own name.\n\n498.\n\nThis autonomy is also reflected in the decision-making processes of the NPS. While there is some level of supervision and oversight by the Korean State, notably by the MHW, the Tribunal is not convinced that this is of such a scale that day-to-day management decisions within the NPS are imposed by the government and can be said to be completely dependent on the Korean State apparatus.\n\n499.\n\nFor example, the NPS Board of Directors and the CEO are appointed by or upon the recommendation of the Minister of Health and Welfare, and the NPS's operational plan must be approved by the Fund Operation Committee and the President. Furthermore, the members of the Special Committee are appointed by the Fund Operation Committee. Other examples include the power of the Minister of Health and Welfare to request reports and to conduct inspections or the oversight by the National Assembly and the Board of Audit and Inspection.\n\n500.\n\nHowever, these supervisory powers are limited in scope and, crucially, not uncommon for State-owned corporations or entities. As Professor Kim has explained, the MHW is not authorized to provide instructions to the NPS regarding the day-to-day business and management of the fund.790 In practice, the supervisory powers are exercised with restraint.791 The NPS has a Board of Directors as an independent decision-making body, which comprises fourteen civilian officers and only one public official.792 As already mentioned in the Statement of Facts, the National Pension Fund itself is managed by the NPSIM, an internal division of the NPS which is headed by the Chief Investment Officer. This shows that the NPS has its own decision-making bodies which are in charge of the day-to-day decisions on the management of the fund and similar to those of a private pension fund. Consequently, the NPS is not completely dependent on the Korean State for its decision-making.\n\nFirst ER SS Kim [**RER-3**], \u00b6 51; Second ER SS Kim [**RER-5**], \u00b6 37.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, 22 March 2022, p. 368:2-370:2 [Cross-examination of SS Kim].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, 22 March 2022, p. 386:4-387:2 [Cross-examination of SS Kim].\n\n501.\n\nNor does the fact that the NPS fulfils a public function suffice to make it a *de facto* State organ. The NPS serves to provide pension benefits for old-age, disability or death.793 While some of its tasks, such as the collection of mandatory contributions, are of an administrative nature, it is also tasked with the management and operation of the assets of the National Pension Fund.794 As stated above, the NPS has approx. USD 600 billion under management and, by the end of 2019, held a 5 percent or more stake in 313 companies listed on the Korean stock exchange. The management of assets, including the acquisition, holding, and sale of shares, is not a core government function. Rather, these activities are commercial transactions which the NPS carries out like a private fund manager.\n\nCf. Korean National Pension Act [**CLA-157**], Arts 1, 24\n\nEnforcement Decree of the National Pension Act, 16 April 2015 [**CLA-150**], Art. 76; Enforcement Decree of the National Pension Act, 1 January 1999 **[R-27**], Art. 54.\n\n502.\n\nFinally, the fact that the NPS is exempted from corporate tax in connection with the management of the National Pension Fund (but not in respect of profits generated from unrelated business activities) may be related to its public mission but does not mean that the NPS is completely dependent on the Korean State apparatus.\n\n503.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal (by a majority) decides that the conduct of the NPS or its employees is not attributable to Respondent under Art. 11.1.3(a) of the FTA because the NPS neither qualifies as a *de jure* nor as a *de facto* State organ.\n\n**c)** ***Whether the conduct of the NPS or its employees is attributable to Respondent under Article 11.1.3(b) of the FTA***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nArticle 11.1.3(b) of the FTA attributes the conduct of \"non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional, or local governments or authorities\" to the State.\n\n505.\n\nAs a preliminary question, the Tribunal will address the Parties' divergent understanding of the term \"powers\".\n\n506.\n\nThe FTA itself does not define what is meant by \"powers\". The ordinary meaning of the term is not clear. If at all, the ordinary meaning of the term, when viewed in the context of the entire provision, indicates that such powers must be governmental.\n\n507.\n\nHowever, due to the unclear ordinary meaning, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to consider the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* as supplementary means of interpretation pursuant to Article 32 VCLT. In the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, the treaty parties have expressed a shared understanding of the term \"powers\" which was included in the negotiation history by mutual agreement: \"For greater certainty, \"powers\" refers to any regulatory, administrative, or other governmental powers\".795\n\n8th Draft Agreement of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (*travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*) (23 March 2007) **[R-39],** p. 135.\n\n508.\n\nThis mutual understanding of the terms \"powers\" was also confirmed by the United States in their non-disputing Party submission.796 It also finds support in ILC Article 5 which, albeit not directly applicable, may guide the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 11.1.3(b) of the FTA.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\n509.\n\nOn that basis, the Tribunal decides that the term \"powers\" in Article 11.1.3(b) of the FTA refers to governmental powers or authority.\n\n510.\n\nThis leads to the question of whether the impugned conduct of the NPS, in particular the vote on the Merger, was an exercise of delegated governmental powers or authority.\n\n511.\n\nIn this context, it bears noting that under Article 11.1.3(b) of the FTA, the specific conduct must be an exercise of delegated governmental authority. As confirmed for example in *Bayindir v. Pakistan* and *Jan de Nul v. Egypt*,797 it does not suffice that the non-governmental entity is generally empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority; rather, it must do so in the particular instance.\n\n*Bayindir v. Pakistan* [**RLA-119]**, \u00b6\u00b6 121-23; *Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008 [**RLA-112**], \u00b6\u00b6 166, 168.\n\n512.\n\nClaimants say that the NPS was exercising governmental powers in its management and operation of the Fund. In support of this, Claimants point, *inter alia*, to the governmental source and mode of delegation of the NPS's powers, the high degree of regulation (including the detailed Voting Guidelines), the exercise of the powers for a public purpose, the immense size and market impact of the NPS's investments, and the accountability of the NPS.\n\n513.\n\nAs a starting point, when looking at the content of the impugned powers, the exercise of shareholder rights in a listed company is not an exercise of governmental authority. Rather, these are rights conferred upon the NPS by virtue of its ownership of shares in SC&T. The NPS exercises these rights in exactly the same way as other private shareholders and does not enjoy any privileges due to its public function. The content of this power is thus purely commercial.\n\n514.\n\nThe additional circumstances that Claimants rely on do not lead to any other conclusion. The fact that the management and operation of the Fund was conferred upon the NPS by legislation does not render every act of the NPS into an exercise of governmental power. The governmental source of delegation as such does not affect the commercial nature of the exercise of voting rights.\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not convinced that the NPS Voting Guidelines which provide, *inter alia,* that the NPS must \"exercise its voting rights to increase shareholder value in the long term\"798 distinguish the NPS from a private investor. It would not be unusual for a large private investment fund to adopt similar principles or guidelines and set up committees for the exercise of voting rights.\n\nArticle 4 of the NPS Voting Guidelines [**R-55**].\n\n516.\n\nNeither do the size of the NPS's shareholding, its market impact or any kind of \"governmental imprimatur\" (if there is any) turn the exercise of shareholder rights by the NPS into an exercise of governmental authority vis-\u00e0-vis other market participants. That the NPS shall also consider the effect of its investment decisions on the national economy and the domestic financial market (\"Principle of Public Benefit\")799 does not imply that the exercise of voting rights serves as an instrument of market control in a way that it could be said to be an exercise of governmental authority.\n\nArticle 4(3) of the Operational Guidelines [**C-6**].\n\n517.\n\nThe same considerations apply to the public function of the NPS and, as a corollary of that, the public oversight of the NPS. While there is no doubt that the NPS fulfils an important public purpose and is subject to oversight by the National Assembly, the National Pension Fund Evaluation Committee and other State authorities, this does not mean that every act of the NPS is governmental in nature. If that were the case, any conduct of the NPS would be attributable to the Korean State under Article 11.1.3(b) of the FTA, and there would no longer by any difference to a State organ. Rather, the specific conduct in question must involve the exercise of governmental authority and in order to show this, it is not sufficient to refer to the general functions of the NPS or its public supervision. The NPS is committed to the benefit and welfare of the Korean citizens as its members in the same way as a private pension fund is to its membership.\n\n518.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides that the conduct of the NPS or its employees is not attributable to Respondent pursuant to Art. 11.1.3(b) of the FTA because the NPS's alleged conduct did not involve the exercise of governmental powers delegated by the Korean State.\n\n**d)** ***Whether the conduct of the NPS or its employees is attributable to Respondent under ILC Article 8***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nHaving decided that Article 11.1.3 of the FTA is *lex specialis* and excludes the application of ILC Article 8, the Tribunal need not decide whether the conduct of the NPS or its employees could be attributed to Respondent under said provision.\n\n520.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal (by a majority) upholds Respondent's objection that the conduct of the NPS and its employees is not attributable to Respondent and falls outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**D. Whether the National Treatment claim falls outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n521.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants' national treatment claim is unfounded and falls outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction due to the reservations made by Korea to the FTA.800 In making this submission, Respondent relies on the following two reservations:\n\n(a) Korea's \"right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets held by state enterprises or governmental authorities\" (the \"**Equity Transfer Reservation**\"); and\n\n(b) Korea's \"right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to \u2026 the following services to the extent that they are social services established or maintained for public purposes: income security or insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, public training, health, and child care\" (the \"**Social Services Reservation**\").801\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 398.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 400, citing FTA: Annex II: Non-Conforming Measures for Services and Investment, Korea Annex II, 15 March 2012 [**CLA-23**], pp. 2-3.\n\n522.\n\nConcerning the Equity Transfer Reservation, Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of the terms \"transfer or disposition\" encompasses the share transactions involved in the Merger because (i) an exchange of shares in one entity (SC&T) for the shares in another (New SC&T) constitutes a two-way \"transfer\" of shares; and (ii) the Merger was a means for the NPS to \"dispose of\" its SC&T shares in order to obtain shares in New SC&T.802 Noting that the phrase \"with respect to\" refers to anything \"in connection with\" or \"in relation to\" its object, Respondent further contends that the NPS's shareholder vote and the impugned conduct of the Blue House and the MHW officials all related to the Merger which, in turn, involved a transfer or disposition of SC&T shares.803\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 402-403; Rejoinder, \u00b6 433.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 404; Rejoinder, \u00b6 434.\n\n523.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent contends that the NPS's vote and any alleged conduct leading to that vote were measures \"with respect to\" the provision of social security and social welfare within the meaning of the Social Services Reservation.804 In this respect, Respondent underscores that the NPS's investment decision to vote on the Merger was undertaken pursuant to its mandate to manage investments for the Korean pensioners and to maintain its ability to provide welfare support, the function of the NPS which Claimants themselves have put forth in their submissions regarding the question of attribution.805\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 408; Rejoinder, \u00b6 437.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 407; Rejoinder, \u00b6 438.\n\n524.\n\nAs to the public purpose requirement in the Social Services Reservation, Respondent, relying on *Vestey v. Venezuela*, posits that the relevant question for determining whether a disputed measure served a public purpose is whether the measure at issue \"was at least capable of furthering that [public] purpose\".806 In Respondent's view, this standard is easily satisfied in this case because there were legitimate economic reasons for the NPS to approve the Merger, as agreed by the majority of SC&T shareholders who evidently also voted in favor of the Merger.807\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 441, citing *Vestey Group Ltd. v.

Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n525.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's argument that its national treatment claim is excluded under the FTA due to the Equity Transfer and Social Services Reservations.808\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 275-276, referring to Treaty, Annex II: Non-Conforming Measures for Services and Investment, Korea Annex II, 15 March 2012 [**CLA-23**], pp. 2-3.\n\n526.\n\nFirst, Claimant submits that Respondent's conduct does not fall within the scope of the Equity Transfer Reservation as the impugned conduct to which their national treatment claim is based concerns the criminal scheme of the Korean government to subvert the NPS's vote on the Merger for the benefit of the Lee family, which are unrelated to the measures \"with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets\".809\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 277-279; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 99.\n\n527.\n\nClaimants likewise assert that the NPS's vote on the Merger, or the Merger itself, was not a \"transfer or disposition\" of equity interests, but rather an exchange of existing shares in SC&T for the shares of a newly created entity, i.e., New SC&T.810 In particular, Claimants note that this exchange, which did not involve conveying shares to one another or to a third party, does not constitute \"transfer\" in accordance with its ordinary meaning.811\n\nReply, \u00b6 279.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 100. See Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online), \"Exchange\", accessed on 6 October 2021 [**CLA-207**].\n\n528.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Equity Transfer Reservation does not apply in this case because Respondent has not shown that its measures were \"implemented in accordance with the provisions of Chapter Twenty-One (Transparency)\", as required under the said Reservation.812 Under Chapter Twenty-One, Claimants explain that Respondent was required, *inter alia*, to criminalize the solicitation or acceptance of bribes by public officials in exchange for an act or omission in the performance of his or her public functions.813 Therefore, Claimants assert that it would be contrary both to the letter and spirit of the Equity Transfer Reservation and Chapter Twenty-One if Respondent could \"evade responsibility for its failure to accord [Claimants] national treatment through a corrupt scheme involving bribery at the highest levels of government by relying on the Equity Transfer Reservation\".814\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 101, citing FTA: Annex II: Non-Conforming Measures for Services and Investment, Korea Annex II, 15 March 2012 [**CLA-23**], p. 3.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 101, citing FTA [**CLA-23**], Art. 21.6(1)(a).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 101.\n\n529.\n\nSecond, Claimants deny the applicability of the Social Services Reservation in this case, arguing that the impugned measures neither related to the NPS's provision of any social service nor were adopted \"for public purposes\".815 In this respect, Claimants stress that the NPS's vote on the Merger was \"part and parcel of the corrupt scheme\" to serve the private interests of JY Lee, the Lee family, and President Park in willful disregard of the interests of the Korean public and in violation of the NPS Guidelines.816\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 282-283; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 102.\n\nReply, \u00b6 283; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104, 106.\n\n530.\n\nSimilarly, Claimants reject Respondent's argument that there were good economic reasons for the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger and by doing so, the NPS acted \"for public purposes\".817 According to Claimants, if the Merger had been in the interests of the NPS and the Korean pensioners as alleged by Respondent, the criminal scheme by the Korean government officials to subvert the NPS's procedure would not have been necessary.818 To bolster their claim, Claimants assert that the Korean pensioners indeed suffered a reduction in value of their assets of at least USD 130 million as a result of the Merger.819\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 105.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 105.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 105.\n\n531.\n\nUnder the Social Services Reservation, Claimants contend that Respondent has the burden of proving that its measures were actually \"established or maintained for public purposes\", not that they were merely \"capable\" of doing so.820 In this respect, Claimants assert that tribunals have assessed the public purpose interest asserted by respondent States by focusing on both the intent and actual impact of the measures.821 In addition, Claimants clarify that the decision in *Vestey Group v. Venezuela* relied upon by Respondent does not state otherwise, but merely notes that a tribunal must consider all relevant circumstances, including the government's post-expropriation conduct in deciding whether a policy was adopted for a public purpose.822\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 107.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 108, referring to *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n532.\n\nArticle 11.12.2 of the FTA provides that \"Articles 11.3, 11.4, 11.8, and 11.9 do not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, subsectors, or activities, as set out in its Schedule to Annex II\".\n\n533.\n\nAccording to the Explanatory Notes to Annex II, \"[t]he Schedule of a Party to this Annex sets out, pursuant to Articles 11.12 (Non-Conforming Measures) and 12.6 (Non-Conforming Measures), the specific sectors, subsectors, or activities for which that Party may maintain existing, or adopt new or more restrictive, measures that do not conform with obligations imposed by: (a) Article 11.3 (National Treatment) or 12.2 (National Treatment); (b) Article 11.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) or 12.3 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment); (c) Article 12.5 (Local Presence); (d) Article 11.8 (Performance Requirements); (e) Article 11.9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors); or (f) Article 12.4 (Market Access)\".\n\n534.\n\nThe Equity Interests Reservation in Korea's Schedule to Annex II reads in relevant part:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Sector:** | All Sectors |\n| **Obligations Concerned:** | National Treatment (Articles 11.3 and 12.2) Performance Requirements (Article 11.8) Senior Management and Boards of Directors (Article 11.9) Local Presence (Article 12.5) |\n| **Description:** | Investment Korea reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets held by state enterprises or governmental authorities. Such a measure shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of Chapter Twenty-One (Transparency). Notwithstanding Article 13.9.3 (Non-Conforming Measures), this entry shall not be treated as a non-conforming measure not subject to Article 13.2 (National Treatment). This entry does not apply to former private enterprises that are owned by the state as a result of corporate reorganization processes. For purposes of this entry: A state enterprise shall include any enterprise created for the sole purpose of selling or disposing of equity interests or assets of state enterprise or governmental authorities. |\n\n535.\n\nThe Social Services Reservation in Korea's Schedule to Annex II provides as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Sector:** | Social Services |\n| **Obligations Concerned:** | National Treatment (Articles 11.3 and 12.2) Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (Articles 11.4 and 12.3) Local Presence (Article 12.5) Performance Requirements (Article 11.8) Senior Management and Boards of Directors (Article 11.9) |\n| **Description:** | Cross-Border Trade in Services and Investment Korea reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the provision of law enforcement and correctional services, and the following services to the extent that they are social services established or maintained for public purposes: income security or insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, public training, health, and child care. |\n\n536.\n\nBoth reservations relied upon by Respondent concern the national treatment obligation under Article 11.3 of the FTA. On that basis, Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Claimants' national treatment claim.\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis with Respondent's objection based on the Equity Interests Reservation. The reservation refers to \"any measure with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets held by state enterprises or governmental authorities\".\n\n538.\n\nHaving decided (by a majority) that the NPS' alleged conduct falls outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Tribunal's analysis in this context is limited to assessing whether the impugned conduct of the Blue House and the MHW are measures that are excluded under the Equity Transfer Reservation.\n\n539.\n\nBased on the ordinary meaning of the reservation, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the alleged interference of the Blue House or the MHW with the NPS's decision-making processes constitute a measure with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets. Even if one accepted for the sake of argument that the Merger was the consequence of the NPS's vote and involved a transfer of shares, any interference in the decision-making process of the NPS on how to exercise its voting rights would, in the Tribunal's view, be too remote to amount to a measure with respect to the transfer of these shares.\n\n540.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides that the Equity Interests Reservation does not apply to Claimants' national treatment claim.\n\n541.\n\nTurning to the Social Services Reservation, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has invoked this reservation in respect of the impugned conduct of the NPS. Respondent has presented this as an alternative argument which \"*excludes, from national treatment protection the actions of the NPS undertaken for the purposes of 'social welfare*'\" in case \"*the Tribunal were to accept that the NPS's conduct is somehow attributable to Korea (which it should not)*\".823 The invocation of the reservation is thus limited to any actions of the NPS.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 406.\n\n542.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's finding (by a majority) that the NPS's conduct is not attributable to Respondent, the Tribunal need not take a decision on the application of the Social Services Reservation to the NPS' impugned conduct. In any event, the Tribunal is of the view that the reservation does not apply because Respondent's measures neither related to the provision of any social service nor were they adopted \"for public purposes\".\n\n543.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's objection based on the Equity Interests Reservation and upholds jurisdiction in respect of Claimants' national treatment claim to the extent that it is not based on alleged conduct of the NPS or its officials.\n\n**VI. MERITS**\n--------------\n\n544.\n\nOn the merits, Respondent raises two threshold defenses against Claimants' claims, submitting (i) that international responsibility can only flow from an exercise of sovereign power, which is absent in the present case (Section VI.A); and (ii) that Claimants' claims are based on the materialization of a known risk that they knowingly assumed (Section VI.B). The Tribunal will deal with these two threshold issues, before turning to Claimants' submissions that Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA by failing to accord (i) the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law to Claimants' investments, in violation of Article 11.5 of the FTA (Section VI.C); and (ii) national treatment, in violation of Article 11.3 of the FTA (Section VI.D).\n\n**A. Whether Respondent is internationally responsible for commercial acts that are not sovereign in nature**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n545.\n\nRespondent submits that the \"conduct Mason impugns\u2014the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger\u2014 was conduct that any ordinary commercial party holding shares in SC&T could have taken, and does not give rise to international responsibility under the Treaty\".824 Respondent asserts that whether this was an exercise of sovereign power \"arises strictly on the merits as a complete threshold answer\" to Claimants' claims,825 and \"the exercise of sovereign power \u2026 is a necessary element for any claim for a breach of international investment treaty obligations\".826\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 298.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 299, citing *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v.

Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n549.\n\nClaimants submit that there is no basis in the Treaty or customary international law for the principle that a State cannot be responsible for a purely commercial act.836 To support this view, Claimants rely on the contention of the United States that Article 11.1.3(a) does not draw distinctions based on the type of conduct.837 Moreover, Claimants reiterate that the FTA mirrors the position of customary international law on this matter, and accordingly, Claimants cite the Commentaries on the ILC Articles that note that \"[i]t is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as 'commercial' or as *acta iure gestionis*\".838 Claimants further cite the Commentaries on the ILC Articles, stating that \"it does not matter that the person or persons involved are private individuals nor whether their conduct involves 'governmental activity.'\"839\n\nReply, \u00b6 200.\n\nReply, \u00b6 201, relying on U.S. Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\nReply, \u00b6 202, citing Commentaries on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 4, cmt. 6.\n\nReply, \u00b6 202, citing Commentaries on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 8, cmt. 2.\n\n550.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants contend that if states cannot be responsible for commercial conduct, it is illogical that there exist secondary rules of state responsibility that distinguish between circumstances where commercial conduct is attributable to a state.840 Claimants also contend that the jurisprudence on which Respondent relies fails to support the existence of such a principle, principally refer to contractual breaches and do not establish anything beyond the fact that a mere contractual breach by a State does not necessarily equate to substantive breach of a treaty.841 Claimants further argue that the necessity of \"sovereign conduct\" in the contractual context has been rejected by the tribunal in *Strabag*.842\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 91.\n\nReply, \u00b6 203, referring to Statement of Defense, \u00b6 303.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 93, relying on *Strabag SE v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it has already dealt with the distinction between sovereign and commercial conduct of a State in the context of attribution under Article 11.1.3(b) of the FTA. In that context, the Tribunal has addressed the question of whether the NPS' conduct involved the sovereign exercise of powers delegated by central, regional, or local governments or authorities.\n\n554.\n\nRespondent's argument that it is not internationally responsible for purely commercial acts is, as Respondent itself states, a \"separate and independent basis\" to dismiss Claimants' claims.846 According to Respondent, the exercise of sovereign power is a necessary element of any treaty violation and a principle enshrined in customary international law.847\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 298.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 300-301.\n\n555.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that aside from the question of attribution, there exists a distinct, general principle under the FTA or customary international law according to which commercial acts of a State do not entail international responsibility. Respondent did not point to any specific provision in the FTA which would support the existence of such principle under the Treaty.\n\n556.\n\nBoth the Commentary to Article 4 of the ILC Articles848 and the jurisprudence849 cited by Respondent deal with the issue whether a breach of contract by a State as such also amounts to a breach of international law (which is indisputably not the case). However, these legal authorities do not support Respondent's assertion of a broader principle of customary international law according to which only the exercise of public power engages a State's responsibility for an internationally wrongful act.\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 4, cmt. 6.\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010 [**RLA-125**], \u00b6\u00b6 327 et seq.; *Robert Azinian and others v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999 [**RLA-84**], \u00b6 87; *Muhammet Cap & Sehil Insaat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd. Sti. v.

Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005 [**CLA-69**], \u00b6 260.\n\n557.\n\nSuch a principle would also undermine the well-balanced rules of attribution which, under certain conditions, attribute commercial conduct to a State. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that it would be illogical to have secondary rules of state responsibility distinguishing between circumstances where commercial conduct is attributable to a State if States cannot be responsible for commercial conduct in the first place.\n\n558.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument that it is not internationally responsible for purely commercial acts that are not sovereign in nature.\n\n**B. Assumption of risks**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n559.\n\nWith reference to *Maffezini v. Spain* and other investment tribunal decisions, Respondent submits that Claimants are not entitled to recover losses arising from the materialization of known risks which they voluntarily assumed when making their investments.850 This general principle of international law, according to Respondent, ensures that \"Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad business judgments\".851 Contrary to Claimants' assertion, there is no distinction between ordinary commercial risks and any other risks knowingly assumed by an investor, including regulatory, legal, and political risks.852 Consequently, Respondent argues that since the risk of the Merger being approved was known and was assumed by Claimants when they invested in SC&T and SEC, Claimants should not be entitled to recover the losses arising from the materialization of those risks.853\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 309-313, referring to *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n570.\n\nIrrespective of whether there is a general principle under international law according to which investors cannot recover losses arising from the materialization of risks that were known and voluntarily assumed by them, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants did not voluntarily assume the risk that the Korean authorities would exert undue influence on the Merger vote.\n\n571.\n\nIn support of its argument that Claimants voluntarily took the risk of the NPS voting against the Merger, Respondent points, *inter alia*, to the following contemporaneous documents:\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] (Daewoo Securities) to [REDACTED] dated 13 June 2014 [**R-375**] with an attached presentation suggesting that the Samsung group has \"focused on transferring [the] most valuable part of the group into SEC\" due to the \"need to centralize the value into their flagship company\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] et al. dated 3 November 2014 [**R-377**] suggesting that pursuing other transactions within the Samsung group \"only make[] sense [\u2026] when the share swap ratios are beneficial to the family\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] dated 17 February 2015 [**R-382**] with an attached document which included, *inter alia,* the following statement on leadership within the Samsung group: \"JV Lee (son) is calling the shots. He was the one who decided to do the buyback, and he made all of the top management changes in other Samsung affiliates. JY's perception, both internally and externally has not improved much recently. He wants to keep stock px up to save face. Also keeping stock price up is a direct way of keeping NPS (pension fund) happy\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] dated 4 March 2015 [**R-385**, **R-385A**] with an attached document (\"writeup\") suggesting that the \"[government] [is] pushing to eliminate the current structure of Chaebols\", that the \"opposition [is] less favorable to Samsung than [the] current [government]\" and that the \"general view is that the [government] won't pass any law that hurts Samsung regardless what the opposition party proposes\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] (KIS America) to [REDACTED] dated 27 May 2015 [**R-394**] suggesting that \"the National Pension Service (NPS), as shareholders of Samsung C&T (9.98% of commons and 2.68% of prefs) should go along with the merger, as the NPS has been pushing for more group restructuring and likely Samsung C&T consulted with the NPS\".;\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to K. Garschina dated 8 June 2015 [**C-126**] including the \"Summary: if nps votes with us them [sic] 80/90 pct chance we win. If nps votes with company then 50/50\" and including a previous email from K. Garschina to [REDACTED] stating that \"Koreans I talked to today (analysts, sales) are more inclined to think nps will support merger. These guys have no insight but it's a reflection of how [k]orean thinks [sic]. Arguments are: govt supports restructuring of samsung and nps is close to govt; stock has rallied so the deal is positive, lee family very powerful\u2026\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] et al. dated 10 June 2015 [**R-417**] suggesting that the \"[m]arket expects NPS will help Samsung Group at the current stage particularly given that the current prices are higher than putback exercise prices. But publicity will influence NPS' decision, in our view. We currently have two different public views on the merger and Elliot's stake acquisition - 1) a fight between US hedge fund a Korean firm (nationalism) and 2) a fight between Samsung and Lee family and minority shareholders. If publicity shifts toward the view of a fight between Lee family and minority shareholders, it will be difficult for NPS to vote yes to the merger\".;\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to K. Garschina et al. dated 10 June 2015 [**R-419**] stating that the \"locals we have spoken to think that there is a 50%+ chance that NPS sides with the company\".;\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to undisclosed recipients dated 15 June 2015 [**R-422**] summarizing an analysis by Eugene Securities according to which the \"merger [is] likely to go through as not a lot of investors will be inclined to ACTUALLY vote against the deal come D-DAY given the likelihood for related stocks to start correcting if the merger gets shot down\" and that it \"is tough to imagine a publicly endowed pension fund to side with a foreign HF in Korea\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to K. Garschina et al. dated 24 June 2015 [**R-429**] suggesting that \"Samsung can make the case that NPS voting 'no' will be a negative pnl event (presumably be Cheil stake will go down much more than CT goes up). So voting yes will actually be fulfilling fiduciary duty to pensioners\" and that \"NPS has an internal Corp gov team that helps decide on final votes. If there is a divide in opinion within or if it's a highly controversial case, NPS then defers to a 9-person proxy voting committee (PVPC) that consists of outsiders (who have ties to NPS). The committee is formed every two yrs and consists of professors, lawyers, and industry specialists. In the last two yrs, this committee has been called on three times (Mando, Kia, SK), and all three times they voted no. It's possible the same commitee could be called on for CT vote. If Samsung can influence members on this commitee, they can get NPS on their side. Currently looks like the commitee may lean towards approving the deal (Will explain in person)\".;\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] (Samsung Securities) to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] dated 6 July 2015 [**R-444**] stating that a \"Korean newspaper (Seoul Economic Daily) article says NPS would likely have its investment committee decide on Samsung C&T merger. Not the 9-member voting rights committee who had voted on behalf of NPS in some of the key events recently\".;\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] dated 7 July 2015 [**R-447**] including a prediction of the vote tally (predicting that the NPS will vote in favor of the Merger) and the suggestion that \"even without the NPS, Elliott should be able to get there\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to undisclosed recipients dated 7 July 2015 [**R-448**] suggesting that the ISS Report is \"not that important\" for the NPS and that \"[p]ublic sentiment and ties to Samsung and other chaebols are more important\";\n\n\u2022 Email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] et al., 8 July 2015 [**C-142**] suggesting that \"the merger getting blocked should ultimately help [SEC] shareholders in the long run\".\n\n572.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this contemporaneous email correspondence shows that Claimants took the possibility into account that the NPS might vote in favor of the Merger. It also emerges from the email correspondence that Claimants were informed that Korean commentators viewed the Korean government as supportive of the Merger and that they considered it possible that public opinion might influence the NPS' decision making.\n\n573.\n\nHowever, there is nothing in these emails (or elsewhere in the record) suggesting that Claimants expected Korean officials to engage in a corrupt, criminal conduct to sway the NPS' Merger vote which Claimants allege as basis of their claims in the present arbitration. This has also been confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Garschina at the Hearing.882\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, 22 March 2022, pp. 353:12-354:6 [Redirect-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n574.\n\nEven if Claimants had been aware of the possibility of criminal interference with the Merger approval, this would go beyond an ordinary commercial risk that might prevent an investor from invoking a treaty violation. Other than in the cases relied on by Respondent,883 Claimants did not expect to be able to convince the Korean government of the adoption of some legislative measure, nor did they assume any business risks associated with any investment.\n\n*Oxus Gold plc v.

Mexico (II)*, which requires the host State not to (i) act arbitrarily or grossly unfairly, including in wilful disregard of due process; (ii) engage in conduct that is discriminatory; (iii) adopt measures that completely lack in transparency; and (iv) act in bad faith towards an investor and an investment.884 In this regard, Claimants point out that Respondent, in the parallel arbitration in *Elliott v. Korea*, accepted Claimants' such position.885\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 175, 177, referring *Waste Management v.

See also Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 5, 25 March 2022, p. 816:16-25 [Claimants' Counsel].\n\n582.\n\nConsequently, Claimants contend that whether Korean law requires a shareholder to have regard to the economic interests of other shareholders irrelevant to their claims under the FTA.895 In any event, Claimants posit that the NPS abused its rights and acted in bad faith in contravention to Korean law by becoming an \"instrument of fraud which deliberately abused the rights that it had as shareholder for an improper and wholly collateral purpose\".896 Moreover, in Claimants' view, the fact that the NPS did not consider the detrimental impact on other shareholders in the Merger vote, contrary to its practice in the SK Merger, further evidence that the NPS abused its rights.897\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 16.\n\n583.\n\nClaimants also oppose Respondent's argument that the Preamble to the FTA suggests that if there is no relevant right under domestic law, then the FTA cannot accord that right.898 Claimants assert rather that the Preamble merely states that the FTA is not meant to create greater rights.899\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, pp. 992:22-993:19 [Claimants' Closing Submission].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, pp. 992:22-993:19 [Claimants' Closing Submission].\n\n**b)** ***Whether Respondent violated the FET standard***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nApplying the contemporary minimum standard of treatment formulated by the tribunal in *Waste Management II*, Claimants argue that Respondent's conduct was arbitrary and grossly unfair, lacked due process and transparency, and was discriminatory against Claimants and their investments, in violation of its obligation to treat Claimants' investments fairly and equitably.900 In particular, for Claimants, the \"undisputed facts\" underlying the criminal convictions of the Blue House and the NPS officials alone establish, beyond any reasonable dispute, that Respondent's conduct was arbitrary, a manifest abuse of process and an offense to judicial propriety.901\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 178; Reply, \u00b6 233; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, p. 989:12-16 [Claimants' Closing Submission].\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 33.\n\n(1) Respondent's conduct was arbitrary and grossly unfair\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nWith reference to the *ELSI* case and *EDF v.

Mexico* does not support Claimants' expansive reading of the term.950 Instead, the ordinary meaning of the phrase \"accord \u2026 treatment\" in Article 11.5 of the FTA read in its context in the light of its object and purpose, Respondent argues, is more limited and requires that \"some conduct be directed at an investment\".951\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 350.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 351, referring to *Corn Products International, Inc. v.

Mexico* [**CLA-10**], p. 61.\n\n614.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants have failed to substantiate that the alleged four obligations of minimum standard of treatment set out by the *Waste Management II* tribunal are born both of State practice and *opinio juris*.955 In this respect, Respondent maintains that the formulation of the contemporary minimum standard of treatment based entirely on investment tribunal decisions offer no direct legal basis to establish a rule of customary international law as incorporated by Article 11.5 of the FTA.956 According to Respondent, while it acknowledged in the *Elliott v.

See Statement of Defense, \u00b6 384, fn. 744.\n\n648.\n\nRespondent advances that it is, in any event, \"possible and sometimes necessary\" to protect the physical security of intangible assets, such as protecting against a deprivation of \"essential corporate rights\" resulting from a \"forceful takeover\" of a refinery, as was the case in *Tatneft v.

See *OAO Tatneft v. Ukraine* [**RLA-146**], \u00b6\u00b6 425-428.\n\n649.\n\nThird, Respondent contends that the scope of the FPS obligation is limited under the FTA's express reference to \"police protection\" which, in its ordinary meaning, connotes protection against physical property and persons.1033 Respondent further explains that mere legal interests do not generally fall within the province of the work of State police, but rather sit within the domain of specialized regulators with subject-specific statutory mandates, such as the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Services in Korea and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, which are tasked with overseeing capital markets and prosecuting violations.1034\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 381-382, 386; Rejoinder, \u00b6 417.

Korea-Albania BIT [**CLA-148**], Art. 2(2).\n\n652.\n\nFinally, even if the FPS standard were to apply to legal certainty, Respondent argues that it is only in cases of aggravated and flagrant failure of duty that a State may be held liable for harm to the foreign investors.1040 However, as explained above, Respondent emphasizes that the NPS did not owe any obligations to Claimants in the NPS's shareholder voting process and therefore cannot have failed to exercise due diligence in carrying out that process.1041\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 394.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 394; Rejoinder, \u00b6 422.\n\n653.\n\nEven if Claimants could establish that one minority shareholder in SC&T (the NPS) owed a duty of care to another minority shareholder (Claimants), Respondent denies that the NPS's binary choice between voting or rejecting the Merger could have evinced such a manifest lack of diligence as to hold Respondent internationally liable, in particular, when it was clear that the NPS could benefit from the holding company structure of the Samsung Group and, therefore, had legitimate commercial incentives to vote in favor of the Merger.1042 Accordingly, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to discharge the heavy burden of proving that Respondent acted in \"manifest negligence\" in failing to take any \"reasonable, precautionary steps\" to prevent economic harm to Claimants' investments.1043\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 397; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 423-424.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 391-393, 395-396, citing F.

U.S. submission**\n----------------------\n\n654.\n\nThe United States submits that the text of Article 11.5 of the FTA demonstrates \"the Parties' express intent to establish the customary international law minimum standard as the applicable the applicable standard in Article 11.5\".1044 In addition, the minimum standard of treatment is \"an umbrella concept reflecting a set of rules that, over time, has crystallized into customary international law in specific contexts\", which establishes a \"floor below which treatment of foreign investors must not fall\".1045\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\n655.\n\nAccording to the United States, Annex 11-A to the FTA expresses the Parties' \"shared understanding\" that the customary international law covered by Article 11.5 \"results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation\".1046 In other words, determining whether a customary international law rule covered by Article 11.5 has crystallized requires a two-element approach\u2014State practice and *opinio juris*\u2014as observed by the ICJ.1047 Accordingly, a purported rule of customary international law formulated based entirely on arbitral decisions, which lack an examination of State practice and *opinio juris*, fails to establish a rule of customary international incorporated in Article 11.5.1048 Likewise, the United States asserts that arbitral decisions interpreting autonomous FET and FPS provisions in other treaties, outside the context of customary international law, are not themselves \"State practice\" for purposes of establishing customary international law even though the examination of State practice in such decisions may be relevant.1049\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, referring to *Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n659.\n\nArticle 11.5 of the FTA provides, in relevant part:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.5: MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT**\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:\n\n(a) \"fair and equitable treatment\" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and\n\n(b) \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.1059\n\nTreaty [**CLA-23**], Art. 11.5.\n\n660.\n\nFootnote 1 to Article 11.5 provides that \"Article 11.5 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 11-A\". This annex is entitled \"Customary International Law\" and provides:\n\nThe Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 15.5 and Annex 11-B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 11.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\n661.\n\nThe Parties agree that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, as referenced in Article 11.5 of the FTA, includes the obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") and full protection and security (\"**FPS**\") to covered investments.1060 However, the Parties disagree on the content and the applicability of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law to that is relevant to this dispute and whether Respondent's conduct amounts to a breach of that standard.\n\nReply, \u00b6 217; Rejoinder, \u00b6 343.\n\n662.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore begin its analysis by determining the scope of application and content of the minimum standard of treatment (a), before addressing the questions of whether Respondent violated the FET standard (b), and whether Respondent's conduct violated the FPS standard (c).\n\n**a)** ***Applicability and content of the minimum standard of treatment***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n663.\n\nRespondent puts forward two arguments regarding the applicability and the content of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 11.5 of the FTA: first, it argues that Claimants have not established the specific content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.1061 Second, it submits that Respondent did not accord Claimants any treatment as required by Article 11.5 of the FTA as neither Korea nor the NPS owed Claimants any duty of care in respect of the conduct Claimants impugn.1062\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 333.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 326.\n\n664.\n\nArticle 11.5 of the FTA provides that the minimum standard of treatment is not an autonomous standard prescribed by the Treaty but one of customary international law. Insofar as the provision mentions the concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\", it clarifies that these concepts do not go beyond that standard of customary international law and do not create any additional substantive rights.\n\n665.\n\nArticle 11.5.2(a) of the FTA mentions a specific obligation that is covered by the FET standard, namely the \"obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world\". As the wording of Article 11.5.2(a) of the FTA (\"includes\") makes clear, this specific obligation is not an exhaustive definition of the standard.\n\n666.\n\nArticle 11.5.2(b) of the FTA contains an abstract definition of the FPS standard, according to which each Party is required \"to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law\". Again, reference is made to the standard of treatment under customary international law.\n\n667.\n\nAnnex 11-A to the FTA provides guidance on the interpretation of Article 11.5 of the FTA in two respects. First, it confirms the common understanding of the treaty parties that customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of State which they follow out of a sense of legal obligation. Thus, as is common practice among States and international courts,1063 two elements \u2013 State practice and *opinio juris* \u2013 are required to determine the content of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Second, Annex 11-2 clarifies that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment set forth in Article 11.5 of the FTA refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\nSee also U.S. Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n668.\n\nThe burden of establishing a custom under international law rests on the party invoking it (i.e., Claimants), as suggested by Respondent and confirmed by the ICJ in the *Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco* case1064 and by the *Cargill v. Mexico* tribunal.1065\n\n*Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco (France v. United States)*, I.C.J.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009 [**CLA-97**], \u00b6 273.\n\n669.\n\nRespondent further submits that to establish a rule of customary international law, it is insufficient to cite the decisions of other investment tribunals interpreting the customary international law standard in other treaties.1066 In the Tribunal's view, it is true that decisions of international courts and arbitration tribunals are not themselves instances of State practice. Yet they can provide valuable guidance in determining the existence of rules of customary international law.1067\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 361-362.\n\nInternational Law Commission, International Law Commission Report on the Work of the Seventieth Session (A/73/10) (2018) [**CLA-196**], p. 149.\n\n670.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal will now turn to identifying the content of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\n\n671.\n\nThe Parties agree that the historical starting point for the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law is the *Neer v. Mexico* decision from 1926.1068 In that decision, the U.S.-Mexico General Claims Commission held that, \"in order to constitute an international delinquency\", the treatment of an alien \"should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\".1069\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 171; Statement of Defense, \u00b6 343 both referring to *L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (U.S.A.) v. United Mexican States*, R.I.A.A. Vol. IV, pp. 60-66, 15 October 1926 [**CLA-10**], p. 61.\n\n*L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (U.S.A.) v. United Mexican States*, R.I.A.A. Vol. IV, pp. 60-66, 15 October 1926 [**CLA-10**], p. 61.\n\n672.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether and, if so, how the customary international law minimum standard of treatment has evolved since that decision from 1926.\n\n673.\n\nClaimants argue that the definition of the *Waste Management v. Mexico (II)* tribunal reflects the contemporary minimum standard of treatment,1070 In that decision, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment is described in the following terms:1071\n\nTaken together, the S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF and Loewen cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 175.\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II* [**CLA-19**], \u00b6 98.\n\n674.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, Respondent argued that Claimants' reliance on the standard set out in *Waste Management v. Mexico (II)* and subsequent decisions endorsing that standard does not discharge its burden to prove State practice.1072 In its Rejoinder, Respondent acknowledged that it accepted that standard as the \"applicable formulation of the [FTA]'s minimum standard of treatment\" in the *Elliott v. Korea* arbitration but argued that Claimants' claims did not meet this standard.1073 Furthermore, Respondent took the view in its Rejoinder that even more recent authorities emphasize the high threshold of severity and gravity necessary to establish a breach.1074\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 337.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 362.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 363.\n\n675.\n\nAmong these authorities is the *Thunderbird v. Mexico* decision which remarked that \"[n]otwithstanding the evolution of customary law since decisions such as Neer Claim in 1926, the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains high, as illustrated by recent international jurisprudence\".1075 As part of this, the *Thunderbird v. Mexico* tribunal also cited the *Waste Management v. Mexico (II)* decision.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. Mexico*, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 January 2006 [**RLA-97**], \u00b6 194.\n\n676.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the threshold for establishing a breach of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law is high. In the Tribunal's view, this is adequately reflected in the formulation of the standard by the *Waste Management v. Mexico (II)* tribunal (\"grossly unfair\", \"outcome which offends judicial propriety\", \"manifest failure of natural justice\", \"complete lack of transparency and candour\"). In the context of domestic court decisions, it bears noting that a breach of domestic law, including an offense under domestic criminal law, does not necessarily amount to a breach of international law.\n\n677.\n\nHowever, the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment should not be overstretched either. As it has been consistently held by tribunals in cases such as *Mondev v. United States, Bilcon v. Canada* or *Pope & Talbot v. Canda*,1076 the contemporaneous minimum standard of treatment is no longer limited to egregious or outrageous conduct, as was held in *Neer v. Mexico* in relation to the physical security of an alien. As the *Mondev v. United States* tribunal put it, \"[t]o the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly or inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith\".1077\n\n*Mondev v. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002 [**RLA-31**], \u00b6\u00b6 116-117; *Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015 [**CLA-3**], \u00b6 435.*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits, 10 April 2001 [**CLA-12**], \u00b6 57.\n\n*Mondev v. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002 [**RLA-31**], \u00b6 116.\n\n678.\n\nWhile these decisions were concerned with the interpretation of Article 1105 of NAFTA, they can still provide useful guidance on the interpretation of Article 11.5 of the FTA. This is because the wording of the provisions is largely similar. While Article 1105(1) of NAFTA requires each Party to accord to investment of investors of another Party \"treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\", Article 11.5 of the FTA obliges each Party to accord to covered investments \"treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\". The Free Trade Commission acting under Article 1131 of NAFTA clarified that \"Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party\".1078 Consequently, both provisions refer to the same customary international law minimum standard of treatment.\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II* [**CLA-19**], \u00b6 90.\n\n679.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law is adequately summarized in the formulation found by the *Waste Management v. Mexico (II)* tribunal. However, the abstract formulation of the standard cannot replace an examination of the particular facts of the case. In the words of the *Mondev v. United States* tribunal, a \"judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case\".1079\n\n*Mondev v. United States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002 [**RLA-31**], \u00b6 118.\n\n680.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to Respondent's second argument that it did not accord any treatment to Claimants as required by Article 11.5 of the FTA because it did not owe any duty of care to Claimants.\n\n681.\n\nIn that regard, Respondent submits that in casting its vote on the Merger, the NPS, as minority shareholder, did not owe any duty of care to other SC&T shareholders, including Claimants.1080 According to Respondent, this implies that Claimants had no basis to expect any particular form of treatment from Respondent and, therefore, no basis to claim that Respondent accord Claimants treatment in violation of Article 11.5 of the FTA.1081\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 316.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 346.\n\n682.\n\nTo recall, Article 11.5 of the FTA provides, in relevant part, that each State Party \"shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law\". Based on the ordinary meaning of the provision, this obligation to treat covered investments in accordance with customary international law is the only duty relevant to the analysis under Article 11.5 of the FTA. Whether Respondent treated Claimants' investments in accordance with customary international law, in particular the FET and the FPS standards, is a question of fact which the Tribunal will address further below.\n\n683.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the terms \"accord \u2026 treatment\" require any additional \"duty of care\" or introduce any additional link between Respondent's conduct and Claimants' investment beyond the legally significant connection required by Article 11.1(1) of the FTA and the causation requirements set forth in Article 11.16(a)(ii) of the FTA.\n\n684.\n\nIt is therefore irrelevant for the analysis under Article 11.5 of the FTA whether the NPS, as a minority shareholder, was required, under Korean and/or international law, to take the economic interests of other shareholders in SC&T into account when casting its vote on the Merger.\n\n685.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent's argument that Article 11.5 of the FTA is not applicable because Claimants were not accorded any treatment.\n\n**b)** ***Whether Respondent violated the FET standard***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n686.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the facts and assess whether Respondent treated Claimants' investments unfairly and inequitably by interfering with the NPS's Merger vote.\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its decision in the jurisdictional part of the award that the NPS's conduct is not attributable to Respondent. Consequently, the Tribunal will limit its factual analysis to the conduct of President Park, Minister Moon or other Korean officials in the Blue House and the MHW.\n\n688.\n\nAs summarized in the Statement of Facts (Section III.C.3) above, Claimants allege that Respondent unlawfully engaged in a concerted effort to force the NPS to approve the Merger by (a) subverting the NPS's internal decision-making process by ensuring that the Investment Committee, instead of the Special Committee, vote on the Merger; (b) ordering the NPS Research Team to fabricate certain calculations, including the synergy effect to make up for the losses the NPS was expected to suffer as a result of the Merger; and (c) pressuring the members of the Investment Committee to approve the Merger.\n\n689.\n\nAccording to Claimants, these factual allegations are established by Korean criminal investigations and trials of senior officials of the Korean government. The criminal and civil proceedings surrounding the Merger vote are summarized in the Statement of Facts (Section III.D) above.\n\n690.\n\nIn support of their factual allegations, Claimants rely, among other exhibits, on the decisions of Korean criminal courts, indictments of Korean prosecutors, witness statements to the public prosecutors and transcripts of court testimony.1082 The court decisions relied on by Claimants include the decisions in the criminal cases against President Park, Minister Moon, CIO Hong, JY Lee and Choi-Soon Sil.\n\nClaimants' Opening Presentation at the Hearing, slide 3; cf. Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 49-101; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 31-81.\n\n(1) Initial observations on the evidentiary value\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n691.\n\nAs a preliminary question, the Tribunal will address the evidentiary value of these court decisions and prosecution documents.\n\n692.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, Respondent submitted that pending the final decisions of the Korean Supreme Court, it did not take a view on the veracity of the findings and appropriateness of the non-final court decisions relied on by Claimants.1083 Respondent added that the courts' findings rested largely on witness testimony that remained untested before this Tribunal.1084 Furthermore, Respondent submitted that allegations made by prosecutors in criminal indictments could not be considered evidence as they represented an inherently one-sided account of the facts and were untested.1085 In its Rejoinder, Respondent reiterated its position that the factual findings and conclusions in the Moon/Hong case remained subject to the Korean Supreme Court's appellate review and that prosecutorial allegations were not conclusive statements of fact.1086 It added that examination reports prepared by prosecutors only contained selective parts of the witness testimony and were therefore only admissible as evidence under certain conditions according to Korean law.1087\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 120.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 120.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 120.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 39.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42.\n\n693.\n\nLeaving aside these remarks on the evidentiary value, Respondent did not contest the factual findings of the Korean courts in the criminal proceedings against President Park, Minister Moon, CIO Hong and other defendants. Neither did it offer any counterevidence to refute the courts' findings or present any testimony from witnesses who were heard by the Korean criminal courts.1088 Instead, Respondent presented its own interpretation of the courts' factual findings (arguing, for instance, that the courts' findings do not support the conclusion that President Park, Blue House officials or the MHW instructed the NPS to secure the approval of the Merger) and contrasted these decisions of the Korean criminal courts with other decisions of the Korean civil courts (notably in the Merger Annulment Case).1089\n\nWhile Mr. Young-Gil Cho, who was called as a witness by Respondent, was interviewed by the Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office and the Special Prosecutor's Office, he did not mention any witness testimony before the Korean courts; cf. WS Cho [**RWS-1**], \u00b6 29; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, 23 March 2022, p. 448:12-18 [Cross-examination of Mr. Young-Gil Cho].\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 123 et seq.; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33 et seq.; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, 20 March 2022, pp. 142:11-146:7 [Respondent's opening statement].\n\n694.\n\nIt is undisputed that the decision of the Seoul High Court in the Park case has become final.1090 After the Hearing, the decision of the Seoul High Court in the Moon/Hong case has also become final. In its list of questions sent to the Parties following the Hearing on 7 April 2022, the Tribunal inquired about the status of the proceedings before the Korean Supreme Court. In their Post-Hearing Briefs, the Parties confirmed that the Korean Supreme Court dismissed the appeals of both the defendants and the prosecution and affirmed the High Court's factual findings in a decision dated 14 April 2022.1091\n\nKorean Supreme Court Case No. 2020Do9836, Prosecutor/Park Geun-hye, 14 January 2021 [**CLA-182**]; cf. Rejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 39; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 17. In response to the Tribunal's further question about the status of the Merger Annulment Case, the Parties confirmed that the appeal against the decision of the Seoul High Court remained pending.\n\n695.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is of the view that any reservations about the non-finality of the Seoul High Court's factual findings in the Moon/Hong case no longer apply. Moreover, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Korean courts' reliance on witness testimony which has not been tested in this arbitration diminishes the evidentiary value of the court decisions in these proceedings. It would have been incumbent on Respondent to offer witness testimony rebutting the Korean courts' factual findings.\n\n696.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, as is apparent from the decisions, the Korean criminal courts conducted an extensive evidence-gathering process, hearing numerous witnesses, considering written statements and a considerable amount of contemporaneous correspondence and other documents.1092 Having carefully studied the court rulings, the Tribunal is convinced that in compiling the facts of the respective case, the Korean courts considered these various pieces of evidence in an open-minded and critical manner.\n\nCf. Seoul Central District, Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 14 et seq.\n\n697.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the factual findings of the Korean criminal courts provide a reliable, and effectively uncontested, evidentiary basis for its assessment whether Respondent violated the FET standard by interfering with the NPS's Merger vote. However, as already mentioned above, a violation of domestic (criminal) law is not the same as a violation of international law. It is for the Tribunal alone to determine whether the facts, as summarized in the judgments of the Korean courts, constitute a violation of international law.\n\n698.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that criminal indictments present the Korean prosecutors' point of view and are not the result of an adversarial process. The Tribunal also takes note of Respondent's comments on the incompleteness of witness examination reports prepared by Korean prosecutors. The Tribunal will take these considerations into account when assessing their evidentiary value.\n\n699.\n\nHaving made these initial observations on evidentiary issues, the Tribunal now turns to summarizing the essential facts that can be discerned from the court decisions in the cases against Minister Moon and CIO Hong, President Park, JY Lee and Choi Soon-Sil cases and that are, in the Tribunal's view, relevant for the determination of a Treaty violation under Section 11.5 of the FTA.\n\n(2) Decision of the Seoul Central District Court in the Moon/Hong case of 8 June 2017\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n700.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis with the decision of the Seoul Central District Court in the Moon/Hong case dated 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**]. At the outset of its factual findings, the court noted, among other things, that from 2 January 2015 until 22 May 2015, the share prices of other major construction companies went up whereas the shares of SC&T were trading at a relatively low price. According to the court, SC&T did not publicly announce a new contract for a power plant in Qatar worth approx. KRW 2 trillion and transferred several construction projects from SC&T to Samsung Engineering. In the court's view, these events \"cast a reasonable doubt that the Samsung Group intentionally kept the SC&T share price low to select a specific time of the Merger, favoring JY Lee, the controlling Lee family, and shareholders of Cheil over the SC&T shareholders\".1093\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 3.\n\n701.\n\nThe court observed that the NPS, as the single largest shareholder owning 11.21% of the shares in SC&T, held a *de facto* casting vote in the Merger. According to the court, several circumstances suggested that the Merger Ratio announced by Samsung was unfair and unfavorable to SC&T shareholders. The court then summarized the analysis of the Merger Ratio by the NPSIM research team and the recommendations which the NPS received from proxy advisories such as ISS, Glass Lewis and Sustinvest.1094 Finally, the court pointed to the fact that the NPS' Investment Committee had referred the vote on the SK Merger to the Experts Voting Committee which had opposed the SK Merger. This led the court to conclude that \"if [the Investment Committee] referred the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee for review and resolution, it was highly likely that the Experts Voting Committee would oppose the Merger, as it did in the SK Merger\".1095\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 3-4.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 5.\n\n702.\n\nIn the next section of the factual findings, the court summarized the facts relating to the charges against Minister Moon, which consist of abuse of authority (Article 123 of the Korean Criminal Act) and perjury (Article 14(1) of the Korean Act on Testimony, Appraisal, etc. before the National Assembly). At the outset, the court noted that Minister Moon had the authority to direct and supervise the NPS, including in personnel and budgetary matters. The court then went on to investigate Moon's role in the NPS voting process and referred to several circumstances showing that Minister Moon abused his authority to get the NPS to approve the Merger.1096\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 5.\n\n703.\n\nAs the first such circumstance, the court referred to the following conversation between Minister Moon and Cho Nam-kwon, Chief of Bureau of Pension Policy in the MHW, in late June 2015 which prompted Cho Nam-kwon to intervene with CIO Hong and other NPS officials:1097\n\nIn late June 2015, Cho Nam-kwon, the Chief of Bureau of Pension Policy under MHW, visited the Defendant Moon in his office in Building 10 of Sejong Government Complex [\u2026] and briefed the Defendant Moon on the status of the Merger. The Defendant Moon told Cho Nam-kwon to the effect that \"I hope the Samsung merger case goes through\". Following the Defendant Moon's instruction, Cho Nam-kwon and others visited NPSIM office [\u2026] on June 30, 2015, and told Defendant Hong and others that \"the Investment Committee should decide on the merger between SC&T and Cheil. Everyone will know, but you should not say that MHW intervened\". Cho Nam-kwon instructed to the effect that NPS should support the Merger.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 5.\n\n704.\n\nIn the section dealing with the allegations against CIO Hong, the court added that CIO Hong who was independently responsible for fund management at the NPS, knew that he should not acquiesce to the intervention of the MHW which, as he knew, had no expertise in investment decisions or the exercise of voting rights for specific shares.1098\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 11.\n\n705.\n\nWhen the MHW' intervention faced internal resistance and NPS officials urged for the Merger vote to be referred to the Experts Voting Committee instead, the MHW again intervened with the NPS in early July 2015. The court found that on 6 July 2015, Cho Nam-kwon and Choi Hong-suk, Director of the National Pension Finance Department at the MHW, reiterated the MHW's request not to refer the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee:1099\n\nHowever, on July 6, 2015, [REDACTED], the head of Investment Strategy Division of NPSIM; [REDACTED], the head of Responsible Investment Team; [REDACTED], the head of Research Team, visited the office of Head of Bureau of Pension Policy and explained the initial draft of the Merger analysis to Cho Nam-kwon, the Bureau chief; Choi Hong-suk, the Section chief of Pension Finance; Baek Jin-ju, a deputy director, stating that \"Despite [the Defendant Moon's instructions], the Merger should be referred to the Experts Voting Committee, as the SK Merger was.\" In response, Choi Hongsuk told [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] that \"NPSIM should not refer the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee and should have a sense of responsibility and decide accordingly.\" In addition, Cho Nam-kwon told [REDACTED] and others, \"So, are you guys going to oppose.\" In other words, Cho Nam-kwon instructed to the effect, again, that NPS should not refer the Merger matter to the Experts Voting Committee and instead, have the Investment Committee support the Merger.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 5-6.\n\n706.\n\nThereafter, according to the court's factual findings, Minister Moon instructed Cho Nam-kwon and others to prepare an analysis predicting the voting pattern of the members of the Experts Voting Committee: \"It must be 100% sure. Prepare detailed response plans tailored to each member of the Experts Voting Committee\".1100 Accordingly, a joint task force of the MHW and the NPS was formed to analyze the inclinations of each member of the Experts Voting Committee.1101 When Minister Moon found out that the approval of the Merger by the Experts Voting Committee was not certain according the analysis (which predicted a tie vote), he \"decided to have the international Investment Committee, entirely composed of NPSIM employees, to support the Merger\".1102\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 6.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 6.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 6, 36.\n\n707.\n\nAccording to the court, Minister Moon instructed Cho Nam-known accordingly on 8 July 2015 who immediately summoned CIO Hong and other NPS officials to the MHW's office:1103\n\nAccordingly, Cho Nam-kwon and others abruptly summoned the Defendant Hong, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] to MHW located in Sejong-si. In Cho Nam-kwon's office, Cho Nam-kwon and others told the Defendant Hong, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], who argued that the matter related to the Merger should be referred to the Experts Voting Committee, that \"[d]o not refer the Merger case to the Expert Voting Committee. Make the decision in the Investment committee. That's what our Minister intends.\" Cho Nam-kwon spoke strongly to the effect that the Merger must be approved by the Investment Committee. Finally, Cho Nam-kwon heard from the Defendant Hong that the Merger case will be decided by the Investment Committee.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 6-7.\n\n708.\n\nThe court reported that thereafter, CIO Hong ordered [REDACTED] who led the Research Team of the NPS to come up with a basis for synergy effects of the Merger to offset any losses which the NPS would suffer due to Merger. Following these orders, the NPS Research Team came up with synergy effects worth more than KRW 2 trillion based on projections which they did not verify.1104\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 7, fn.12.\n\n709.\n\nOn 10 July 2015, CIO Hong convened the Investment Committee which was informed of the synergy effects calculated by the NPS Research Team and approved the Merger. The three non-standing members of the Investment Committee were appointed by CIO Hong who, according to the court, deviated from the custom of nominating members of the Management Strategy Division Team. According to the court, CIO Hong advised the Committee members to vote for the Merger before the session.1105\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 7-8, fn. 13 .\n\n710.\n\nAccording to the court, CIO Hong ignored the request of the Chairman of the Experts Voting Committee, [REDACTED], to convene the Experts Voting Committee and let it decide on the Merger. Around 12 July 2015, Minister Moon instructed Choi Hong-suk to personally contact individual members of the Experts Voting Committee and induce them to prevent the convocation of the meeting. The court further found that Minister Moon personally called [REDACTED] , an Experts Voting Committee member, and told him that \"the decision was made by the [Investment] Committee, not by an individual. To my understanding, there is no procedural problem. But they are still trying to convene the Experts Voting Committee. Please silence them\".1106 The court concluded that by doing so, Minister Moon attempted to appease the resistance of the Experts Voting Committee. A meeting of the Experts Voting Committee was nevertheless convened on 14 July 2015. According to the court, Choi Hong-suk attended it as an administrative secretary trying to induce it not to overturn the decision of the Investment Committee, and later redacted the press release excluding phrases relating to the problematic convocation of the Investment Committee.1107\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 8.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 8.\n\n711.\n\nThe court then reached the following conclusion on Minister Moon's interference with the Merger vote:1108\n\nThrough Cho Nam-kwon, the MHW officer in charge, and others, the Defendant Moon caused the Defendant Hong and [REDACTED] to prevent the referral of the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee and had the Investment Committee to review and approve the Merger. In other words, the Defendant Moon abused his authority to direct and supervise NPS to cause the Defendant Hong and [REDACTED] to take actions which are not to be performed by them.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 8.\n\n712.\n\nAs the court's outline of evidence included in the reasoning shows, the court heard testimony from both defendants and numerous witnesses, including the above-mentioned MHW officials Cho Nam-Kwon and Choi Hong-Suk and the NPS officials [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].\n\n713.\n\nIn the judgment section of the decision, the Seoul Central District Court justified its decision to convict Minister Moon of an abuse of authority pursuant to Article 123 of the Korean Criminal Act as follows:1109\n\nAccording to the Factual Findings and Admitted Factual Relation, as shown above, the actions by the Defendant Moon can be summarized as follows: (i) In late June 2015, the Defendant Moon told Cho Nam-kwon, the chief of Bureau of Pension Policy, that he would like to see the Merger get consummated, practically instructing Cho Nam-kwon to intervene in the exercise of the voting rights by NPS; (ii) On July 6, the Defendant Moon received reports from public officials of Bureau of Pension Policy, including Cho Nam-kwon, that NPS was to refer the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee. The Defendant Moon then instructed them to devise a detailed response plan tailored to each Experts Voting Committee member to clinch the approval of the Merger; (iii) In the morning of July 8, when MHW decided to refer the Merger to the Investment Committee, instead of the Experts Voting Committee, the Defendant Moon granted his approval to the public officials of MHW to the effect that the Investment Committee should be the one to pass a resolution to support the Merger.\n\nThrough a series of such actions, particularly pressuring NPSIM immediately after the actions in (i) and (iii) above, the Defendant Moon\u2014who, as the Minister of Health and Welfare and Chairman of the Fund Operating Committee, has authority to direct and supervise NPS\u2014intervened in the exercise of specific voting rights by NPS, whose independence in fund management is guaranteed, and imposed the specific direction of the decision-making through the public officials of MHW. Such actions by the Defendant Moon constitute unlawful exercise of a public official's general authority. Such improper intervention and direction by the Defendant Moon provided the Defendant Hong and other NPSIM officials with no other options than passing a resolution for the Merger in the Investment Committee. The Defendant Hong and other NPSIM officials, as to be seen below, engaged in acts which are not obligated by them.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 47-48.\n\n(3) Decision of the Seoul High Court in the Moon/Hong case of 14 November 2017\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n714.\n\nIn its decision of 14 November 2017, the Seoul High Court upheld the convictions of Minister Moon and CIO Hong and largely confirmed the Seoul Central District Court's decision. On 14 April 2022, the Korean Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the Seoul High Court.\n\n715.\n\nIn its statement of facts, the Seoul High Court made the following findings regarding the undervaluation of SC&T's shares and the likelihood of the Experts Voting Committee to vote against the Merger:1110\n\nThe degree of undervaluation of SC&T's shares at the time was generally analyzed to be more severe than that of SK shares. The SK Merger was a situation in which NPS's stake in the surviving entity would increase after the merger, and the Expert Voting Committee decided against the merger. This decision was made even though the ISS (Institutional Shareholder Services) and the Korea Corporate Governance Service (the \"KCGS\") (which are institutions that provide advice on voter rights) presented an opinion in favor of the merger. Therefore, it was predicted that if the proposal of the SC&T Merger were referred to the Expert Voting Committee, then would be highly likely that a decision against the Merger would be made.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 10.\n\n716.\n\nThe Seoul High Court further confirmed the lower court's findings that Minister Moon had informed Cho Nam-known in late June 2015 that he wanted the Merger accomplished and that on 30 June 2015 Cho Nam-kwon and Choi Hong-suk instructed CIO Hong and other NPS officials that the Investment Committee should decide on the Merger but that they should not say that the MHW intervened.1111\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 11.\n\n717.\n\nMoreover, the Seoul High Court confirmed that on 6 July 2015, Minister Moon and other MHW officials had looked for ways to secure approval for the Merger through the Expert Voting Committee.1112 Yet when they analyzed the voting pattern and found out that the vote would likely result in a tie, Minister Moon decided to let the Investment Committee decide on the Merger. The minister's decision was relayed to the NPS by the MHW employees Baek Jin-ju and Cho Nam-kwon.1113\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 12.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 13.\n\n718.\n\nThe Seoul High Court also described in detail how the benchmark merger ratio calculated by the NPS changed from a range of 0.46 to 0.89 in the first report of around 30 June 2015 to a range of 0.34 to 0.68 in the third report prepared for the session of the Investment Committee on 10 July 2015 due to pressure exercised by [REDACTED] who was Head of the Research Team at the NPS.1114 Likewise, the Seoul High Court found that CIO Hong and [REDACTED] instructed the NPS Research Team to come up with merger synergy effects in the amount of KRW 2 trillion which was required to offset the expected loss arising from the Merger.1115\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], pp. 15-17.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], pp. 17-19.\n\n719.\n\nRegarding the session of the Investment Committee on 10 July 2015, the Seoul High Court found that [REDACTED] and CIO Hong relied on these alleged synergy effects to argue, in response to questions by committee members, that they offset the losses caused by the Merger.1116\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], pp. 19-21.\n\n720.\n\nFollowing the statement of facts, the Seoul High Court went on to analyse the appeal grounds raised by the two defendants. In respect of Minister Moon, it reached the following conclusion:1117\n\nDefendant Moon abused his authority to instruct and supervise the NPS, and through MHW public officials, made Defendant Hong report that the Merger would be decided by the Investment Committee and not the Expert Voting Committee. Defendant Moon invited some of the Investment Committee members to vote in favor and made [REDACTED] explain the Merger using a manipulated merger synergy value in order to induce a decision in favor of the Merger. Defendant Moon also made [REDACTED] explain the Merger to the Investment Committee members using a manipulated merger synergy to induce a favorable vote, and made them perform an act which they are not obligated to do.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], pp. 26-27.\n\n721.\n\nRegarding Minister Moon's criminal intent, the Seoul High Court found that the involvement of Blue House officials did not exonerate Minister Moon and that he was at least aware of President Park's order to \"attend to the NPS's voting issue concerning the Merger\".1118\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 27.\n\n722.\n\nIn the grounds for sentencing, the Seoul High Court provided the following reasoning for the conviction of Minister Moon1119:\n\nBecause the Fund is the source of pension benefits, it must be managed and administered to maintain its financial stability in accordance with the principle of profitability, stability, public benefit, and liquidity. It must not be means for a policy objective irrelevant to the interests of the pension subscribers, and it must not be used for political agendas or interest groups. Under the delegation by the Minister of Health and Welfare, which manages and administers the Fund and has created the NPSIM, it has separated the Fund's operation from the pension enrollment and payment sector, and the Fund's individual investment decisions are delegated to the NPSIM which was separately established so that it could make independent decisions. Institutional safeguards are provided to prevent the interference of administrative agencies, political power, or interest groups in management and administration of the Fund. These safeguards include the rule that the exercise of voting rights on the shares that it possess are required to be autonomously deliberated and decided by the Investment Committee at the NPSIM in accordance with the Voting Guidelines. And the NPSIM officers and employees, as agents that manage the Fund, must administer the Fund based on autonomy and independence, with transparency and expertise as the fiduciary duty.\n\nDefendant Moon, who directs the Fund's management and administration as the Minister of Health and Welfare, abused his authority to instruct and supervise the NPS. He did this by making Defendant Hong, etc., through MHW public officials, induce a decision for the Merger, and thereby caused performance of act not to be performed. Also, Defendant Moon took an oath under the Act on Testimony, Appraisal, etc., Before the National Assembly but testified falsely, which, given the nature of the crime is not good. Defendant Moon also, to achieve a certain company's merger, exerted unlawful and unjust influence over the NPS's exercise of voting rights of shares in a certain company, and thus turned the institutional safeguard created to guarantee the Fund's independent administration merely into form, and brought about loss on the NPS. Moreover, Defendant Moon caused the people to lose trust in the Fund's expert and autonomous management and administration and undermined the basis of the national pension system. Considering the above, Defendant Moon needs to be punished severely.\n\nHowever, this is Defendant Moon's first offense. Also, it appears that under the situation that he was about to leave his office as the Minister of Health and Welfare after settlement of the MERS incident, Defendant Moon committed the crime of abusing authority without properly looking at the harm and repercussions. We also look at Defendant Moon's age, character and conduct, environment, motive, method, outcome, post-crime circumstances, etc. We considered the sentencing conditions that appeared in the arguments of this case and hereby set a sentence of Defendant Moon as described in the order.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], pp. 49-50.\n\n723.\n\nThe Seoul High Court thus confirmed that Minister Moon had abused his authority by instructing the NPS to let the Investment Committee decide on the Merger and by exerting influence on the Investment Committee to vote in favor of the Merger. The Seoul High Court also affirmed that Minister Moon's interference led to the Investment Committee deciding on the Merger on the basis of manipulated synergy effects and refraining from referring the vote to the Experts Voting Committee.\n\n(4) Decisions of the Seoul Central District Court and Seoul High Court in the Park case\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the criminal proceedings against President Park. As summarized in the Statement of Facts above, the decision of the Seoul Central District Court of 6 April 2018 [**CLA**-**134**] was overturned by the Seoul High Court on 24 August 2018 [**CLA-15**] which reached a different conclusion, *inter alia,* on the existence of a succession plan within the Samsung Group. While the Seoul High Court's decision was also overturned and remanded by the Korean Supreme Court on 29 August 2019 [**R-276**], this concerned the formation of a single sentence for multiple offenses which, in the Korean Supreme Court's view, violated the Public Official Election Act. On remand, the Seoul High Court amended the sentence on 10 July 2020 [**R-284**] and this decision was upheld by the Korean Supreme Court on 14 January 2021 [**CLA-182**].\n\n725.\n\nIn its decision of 6 April 2018, the Seoul Central District Court found that on 25 July 2015, President Park held a private meeting with JY Lee in which she requested him to financially support an equestrian organization.1120 The court further found that JY Lee complied with that request and that President Park and her confidante Choi Seo-won received financial benefits from him and others totaling several million KRW.1121\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap364-1, Prosecutor/Park Geun-hye, 6 April 2018 [**CLA-134**], p. 3.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap364-1, Prosecutor/Park Geun-hye, 6 April 2018 [**CLA-134**], pp. 5-6.\n\n726.\n\nIn its decision of 24 August 2018, the Seoul High Court found that the Merger served the purpose of consolidating JY Jee's control over SEC and was a key element of the Lee family's succession plan.1122 On the involvement of President Park in the Merger vote, the court made the following findings:1123\n\nThe Defendant instructed Choi Won-young, Senior Secretary to Employment and Welfare, to \"keep a close eye on the NPS's exercise of voting rights on the Merger.\" Choi Wonyoung testified at the investigation agency and the lower court to the effect that, \"Around late June 2015, I received an order from the Defendant to keep a close eye on the NPS's voting issue concerning the Merger and told senior administrative officer Roh Hong-in / Noh Hong-In to look into the situation.\" In Choi Won-young's notes is written, \"issues of NPS's voting in Samsung-Elliott dispute.\" Such instruction came when the Expert Voting Committee just voted against the SK Holdings Co. merger, after which it became more likely that the Expert Voting Committee would vote against the Merger, and when the Samsung Group faced an emergency situation [\u2026] with aggravating difficulties as Elliott came on the scene. The Defendant's instruction was not just a general instruction to keep a close eye on 'the Merger' but a specific one to keep a close eye on the 'exercise of voting rights'.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 15.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 37\n\n727.\n\nAccording to the Seoul High Court, Choi Won-young then passed these instructions on to other Blue House officials who requested information on the Merger from the MHW and were from then on continuously briefed on the Merger.1124 The court established that President Park was updated on the plan to induce the Investment Committee to approve the Merger.1125 According to the court, An Jong-beom, Senior Secretary for Economic Affairs at the Blue House, was immediately informed about the result of the Investment Committee's vote and gave the instruction to dismiss the Investment Committee members who had been on standby for a possible meeting. On 17 July 2015, An Jong-beom was informed about the \"successful closure\" of the Samsung case.1126\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 37.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 36.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], pp. 39..\n\n728.\n\nThe Seoul High Court concluded that President Park \"gave direction or approval during the process of deciding on the approval of the issue of the Merger\"1127 and that by \"having the Ministry of Health and Welfare unduly intervene in the process of the NPS' exercise of its voting rights, the Defendant and her presidential staff in the Blue House had caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger\".1128\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 40.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 45.\n\n729.\n\nThe Seoul High Court acknowledged that the Merger had already been approved by the shareholders prior to the relevant meeting between President Park and JY Lee on 25 July 2015 and determined that therefore no *quid pro quo* relationship required for the crime of accepting a bribe could be established.1129 Nevertheless, the court considered that there was a common understanding between President Park and JY Lee that Samsung's sponsorship for an equestrian organization would be the reward for President Park's assistance in the implementation of the Lee family's succession plan:1130\n\nAt the time of the talks, there was already a common perception and understanding formed between the Defendant and Lee Jae-yong as to the pending issue, namely Lee Jae-yong's succession, and the friendly stance of the Defendant who held powerful authority and position in connection therewith. There was a decisive assistance from Park Geun-hye Administration to the Merger immediately prior to the meeting, and such friendly stance of Park Geun-hye Administration towards the succession was sustained afterwards. As discussed later, in her meeting with Lee Jae-yong, the Defendant requested him to support cultural prosperity and sports development and sponsor an organization established by certain winter sports medalists. The Defendant also requested Lee Jae-yong during her one-on-one talks with him on February 15, 2016 to sponsor the Sports Elite Center by specifying the amount of such sponsorship, and it is reasonable to assume that the Defendant and Lee Jae-yong still shared an understanding as to Lee Jae-yong's succession at the time of the February 15 meeting as well. When the sponsorship for the Sports Elite Center and others is considered to have been rendered in exchange for the above common understanding, it shall be deemed that there was a common perception or understanding between the Defendant and Lee Jae-yong over the performance of specific duties being solicited and the fact that the sponsorship was the price of the performance of such duties. This constitutes a solicitation by implicit declaration of intention.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], pp. 54-55.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (further translation of CLA-15) [**R-258**], p. 46.\n\n(5) Decision of the Korean Supreme Court in the JY Lee case of 29 August 2019\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n730.\n\nIn its decision of 29 August 2019, the Korean Supreme Court reiterated that \"Lee Jae-yong was requested by the former President to provide the equestrian support during the one-on-one meeting with the same, and in order to offer a bribe in connection with such duty, provided the equestrian support to Jeong Yu-ra\" (who is the daughter of Choi Seo-won, the President's confidante).1131\n\nKorean Supreme Court, Case No. 2018Do2738, Prosecutor/Lee Jae-yong, 29 August 2019 [**CLA-133**], p. 6.\n\n731.\n\nThe Korean Supreme Court then considered the lower court's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence of a comprehensive succession plan which was the object of unjust solicitation. The Korean Supreme Court disagreed with this conclusion, holding that \"when viewed in light of the comprehensive authority of the President [\u2026] there is sufficient room to view that the financial support for Sports Elite Center Entity was a quid pro quo for the duty of the President\".1132\n\nKorean Supreme Court, Case No. 2018Do2738, Prosecutor/Lee Jae-yong, 29 August 2019 [**CLA-133**], p. 9.\n\n732.\n\nConsequently, the Korean Supreme Court remanded the case to the Seoul High Court which amended the factual findings of the lower court to reflect that \"benefits equivalent to KRW 3.41797 billion (or EUR 2.58 million)\" were provided \"in return for the illegal solicitation of support for the succession to Defendant A\", i.e., JY Lee.1133\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2019No1937, Prosecutor/Lee Jae-yong, 18 January 2021 [**CLA-181**], p. 4.\n\n(6) Decision of the Korean Supreme Court in the Choi Seo-won and An Jong-beom case of 29 August 2019\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n733.\n\nIn the criminal case against President Park's confidante Choi Seo-won and Blue House official An Jong-beom the Korean Supreme Court rendered its decision on 29 August 2019. With regard to the meeting between President Park and JY Lee on 25 July 2015 and the quid pro quo relationship, it summarized the lower court's conclusion as follows:1134\n\nWhen meeting one-on-one on July 25, 2015, common awareness and understanding had been formed between the former President and Lee Jae-yong on the favorable position of the former President regarding Lee Jae-yong's issue of succession works. At the one-on-one meeting, the former President requested Lee Jae-yong to support Sports Elite Center corporation. There existed a common awareness or understanding between the former President and Lee Jae-yong that the performance of duties by the former President for Lee Jae-yong's succession works and Lee Jae-yong's support of Sports Elite Center corporation were in a quid pro quo relationship.\n\nKorean Supreme Court, Case No. 2018Do13792, Prosecutor v. Choi Soon-Sil,, 29 August 2019 [**CLA-132**], p. 5.\n\n734.\n\nAccording to the court, the term \"succession works\" refers to \"the reorganization of Samsung Group's governance structure with the goal of securing maximum de facto voting rights in Samsung Group's key affiliate companies, Samsung Electronics and Samsung Life Insurance, with the minimum use of Lee Jae-yong's personal fund\" and included the Merger between SC&T and Cheil.1135\n\nKorean Supreme Court, Case No. 2018Do13792, Prosecutor v. Choi Soon-Sil,, 29 August 2019 [**CLA-132**], pp. 4-5.\n\n735.\n\nReviewing the lower court's conclusions, the Korean Supreme Court held that a quid pro quo relationship between the President's support of the succession plan and JY Lee's financial support to the equestrian organization had been sufficiently established:1136\n\nAccording to the facts found by the court below, it can be seen that the succession works were carried out systematically at Samsung Group level with the Future Strategy Office being at the center and with a clear goal of: strengthening Lee Jae-yong's control with respect to the key affiliates of Samsung Group, Samsung Electronics company and Samsung Life Insurance company, at a minimum cost. The succession works as above are specified to the extent of recognizing a quid pro quo relationship between the performance of duty of the former President with respect thereto and the profits offered. These may rise to illegal solicitation because the authority of the President can influence the succession works with such clear purpose and nature.\n\nSince the succession works alone can establish a quid pro quo relationship, it is neither necessary to prove by specifying the quid pro quo relationship in regard to each issue that proceeded as part of the succession works, nor is it required that such issue already occurred at the time of solicitation. Therefore, when the reasoning of the court below is reviewed in the context of the foregoing legal theories and the lawfully admitted evidence, the court below did not err.\n\nKorean Supreme Court, Case No. 2018Do13792, Prosecutor v. Choi Soon-Sil, 29 August 2019 [**CLA-132**], pp. 5-6.\n\n(7) Facts established by the Korean court decisions\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n736.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal considers the following facts to be established by the Korean court decisions:\n\n\u2022 President Park was aware of the Lee family's succession plan in which the Merger played a key role and personally helped implementing it. In late June 2015, she instructed Choi Won-young to \"keep a close eye\" on the exercise of the NPS' voting rights. This could only be understood as ensuring that the NPS vote in favor of the Merger.\n\n\u2022 President Park's support of the succession plan was rewarded by JY Lee and the Samsung Group with financial benefits for Choi Seo-won and her daughter. In exchange for her general support of the succession plan, President Park requested JY Lee in a meeting on 25 July 2015 to step up his support for the equestrian organization which ultimately benefitted Choi Seo-won's daughter.\n\n\u2022 On the instructions of President Park, Blue House officials closely monitored developments within the NPS regarding the exercise of its voting rights and updated President Park on the progress.\n\n\u2022 In late June 2015, Minister Moon, who was aware of President Park's order to attend to the NPS' voting issue, instructed Cho Nam-kwon to ensure that the NPS support the Merger and that the Investment Committee decide on the Merger vote. Cho Nam-kwon and Choi Hong-suk relayed these instructions to the NPS.\n\n\u2022 When it became apparent that this plan faced internal resistance within the NPS, Minister Moon gave the instruction to prepare a response plan tailored to individual Experts Voting Committee members and to look for ways to secure approval for the Merger through the Experts Voting Committee. Once he found out that approval of the Merger by the Experts Voting Committee was uncertain, he decided to by-pass the Experts Voting Committee and let the Investment Committee take the vote instead. Again, these instructions were transmitted to CIO Hong and other NPS officials by Cho Nam-kwon and other MHW officials who made it clear that the Merger must be approved by the Investment Committee.\n\n\u2022 Thereafter, CIO Hong instructed the NPS Research Team to come up with synergy effects in the amount of the expected losses to the NPS as a result of the Merger. On instructions of Minister Moon, these manipulated synergy effects were presented to the Investment Committee in its voting session on 10 July 2015 and influenced its decision to vote in favor of the Merger.\n\n\u2022 Around 12 July 2015, Minister Moon gave instructions to contact members of the Special Committee and personally contacted one of them to prevent them from convening a session in which they might have overturned the decision of the Investment Committee.\n\n737.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these facts show that President Park, Minister Moon and subordinate Blue House and MHW officials exerted influence on the NPS' exercise of its voting rights in the Merger. They did so by instructing CIO Hong and other NPS officials to refrain from referring the vote to the Experts Voting Committee and let the Investment Committee decide instead which they considered to be more inclined to vote in favor of the Merger.\n\n738.\n\nThey also interfered with the Merger vote by instructing CIO Hong and other NPS officials to ensure that the Investment Committee support the Merger. In the Tribunal's view, this instruction could only be understood by NPS officials as meaning that they should take all necessary measures to ensure that the Investment Committee approves the Merger. Independent of whether there were specific instructions to manipulate the NPS' calculations of the Merger benchmark ratio or the synergies effects, these actions of NPS officials were clearly taken in pursuance of the general instruction to get the Investment Committee to support the Merger. While the manipulations of NPS officials are not attributable to Respondent, the instructions of the Blue House and MHW to the NPS are.\n\n(8) Evaluation of the Blue House and MHW conduct against the FET standard\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n739.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that President Park's solicitation of financial benefits in exchange for her government's support of the Lee family's succession plan, which included the Merger, violates the FET standard. Although the meeting between President Park and JY Lee on 25 July 2015 took place after the Merger vote, the Tribunal finds it highly likely, as held by the Korean Supreme Court in the JY Lee and Choi Seo-won cases, that prior to that meeting, there was a common understanding between President Park and JY Lee that she would support the Lee family's succession plan, which included the Merger, in exchange for financial benefits. In any event, President Park's support of the Merger was rewarded by undue benefits after the approval of the Merger. In the Tribunal's view, this conduct amounts to a willful neglect of due process and proper procedure based on personal preference and is arbitrary and grossly unfair.\n\n740.\n\nIn addition, and independently, the Tribunal considers the interference of Minister Moon and other MHW officials in the NPS' exercise of its voting rights to be in violation of the FET standard.\n\n741.\n\nPursuant to Article 8(1) of the Voting Guidelines provides that the voting rights of equities held by the Fund are exercised through the deliberation and resolution of the Investment Committee established by the NPSIM. According to paragraph 2 of the same article, for items which the Investment Committee finds difficult to choose between an affirmative and a negative vote, the NPSIM may request for a decision to be made by the Experts Voting Committee. In similar vein, Article 17(5) of the Fund Operational Guidelines provide that voting rights are, in principle, exercised by the NPS whereas items for which it is difficult for the NPS to determine whether to approve or disapprove are decided by the Experts Voting Committee.\n\n742.\n\nThere are thus two designated decision-making bodies which may resolve on the exercise of voting rights. Irrespective of which of the two decision-making bodies was competent to decide on the Merger vote (which the Tribunal will address below), it is clear that the exercise of voting rights falls within the competencies of the NPS and not within those of the MHW. As stated above in the context of attribution, the NPS enjoys considerable autonomy in the management of the fund and is only subject to limited oversight by the MHW. In particular, the MHW is not authorized to provide instructions to the NPS regarding day-to-day management decisions.\n\n743.\n\nConsequently, the MHW' interference in the decision-making process of the NPS was in excess of its supervisory powers. Although the decision to vote in favor of the Merger was formally taken by the Investment Committee, the MHW prejudiced it by instructing CIO Hong and other NPS officials to ensure that the Investment Committee decides on and approves the Merger vote. This led the Korean courts to conclude that Minister Moon abused his authority in a criminal manner. In the Tribunal's view, this interference, which did not serve a legitimate reason but was aimed at favoring the interests of JY Lee to the detriment of SC&T shareholders, violates the FET standard as it completely lacked due process and transparency and was arbitrary and grossly unfair.\n\n744.\n\nIn reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal does not consider it relevant whether it would have been justifiable under the NPS Guidelines for the Investment Committee to decide on the exercise of the NPS' voting rights. Whether the Investment Committee would have referred the vote to the Experts Voting Committee but for Respondent's undue interference is a question of causation that the Tribunal will address further below. At this stage, it is sufficient to state that both the Blue House and MHW unduly interfered in the internal decision-making process of the NPS, as they assumed that otherwise the Expert Voting Committee would be seized and would decide against the Merger. This interference in the decision-making process of an independent body, which was motivated by improper reasons, constitutes the violation of the Treaty.\n\n745.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal does not consider it relevant either whether there were sound economic reasons for the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger. The Tribunal will address these arguments in the context of causation.\n\n746.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not consider the two decisions of Seoul Central District Court in the civil cases initiated by Elliott1137 and by domestic Korean investors1138 to contradict the factual findings of the Korean criminal courts summarized above and to lead to any other conclusion. As summarized above, the civil division of the Seoul Central District Court denied Elliott's application for an injunction against the Merger approval. The decision was upheld by the Seoul High Court.1139 In the second case, the court declined to retroactively annul the Merger. The appeal against that decision is still pending before the Seoul High Court.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2015KaHab80582, 1 July 2015 [**R-177**].\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017 [**R-242**].\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2015Ra20485, 16 July 2015 [**R-214**].\n\n747.\n\nIn the first case, Elliott argued that the Merger Ratio was unfair, that the Merger was pursued to strengthen the control of JY Lee over the merged company and that it violated Korean financial regulations. The Seoul Central District Court dismissed Elliott's application in part for lack of standing and in full for lack of merit. The court decided that the Merger Ratio was calculated in accordance with the statutory formula under Korean law and that Elliott did not establish that the stock prices which the Merger Ratio was based on were influenced by market manipulation or dishonest transactions. The court rejected Elliott's argument that SC&T's shares were undervalued on the grounds that a share price in an open market generally can be assumed to reasonably reflect the objective value of the stock-listed company and that there was no compelling evidence to the contrary. The court also held that the fact that SC&T's share price rose after the Merger Announcement indicated that the market viewed the Merger favorably and not as damaging to SC&T shareholders. It rejected Elliott's argument that the Merger was pursued for the benefit of the Lee family as insufficiently substantiated. Finally, the court found that the Merger was not in violation of Korean financial regulations.\n\n748.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this was a civil case in which the court decided based on the evidence submitted by the parties. Unlike a criminal court, it did not engage in any fact-finding on its own motion. As it emerges from the decision, the court rejected several of Elliott's arguments as not sufficiently supported by evidence. Notably, the court was unaware of the criminal interference of Korean government officials (which was only established by the subsequent decisions of the Korean criminal courts). Consequently, the decision does not contradict the factual findings of the Korean criminal courts. Given the civil court decided according to the burden of proof, it also cannot establish that the Merger served a legitimate purpose and offered economically sound synergies to SC&T.\n\n749.\n\nIn the second case, the applicants who were domestic Korean investors in SC&T sought the retroactive annulment of the Merger on the grounds that the purpose of the Merger was improper, that the Merger Ratio was disadvantageous to SC&T shareholders and manifestly unfair, that the directors of SC&T breached their fiduciary duties approving the Merger, that the NPS illegally affected the Merger Ratio, and that the NPS exercised its voting rights unlawfully by acting under the improper instructions of President Park and Minister Moon.\n\n750.\n\nIn its reasoning, the Seoul Central District Court first stressed that the threshold for retroactively invalidating a merger is high. As part of the evidence before it, the court considered the decisions of the criminal division of the Seoul Central District Court against Minister Moon and CIO Hong. The court decided that despite the criminal convictions, the purpose of the Merger could not be considered unfair because at the time of the Merger announcement, SC&T's earnings were declining due to various factors and that the Merger could be considered as a way to overcome this stagnation. Again, the court noted that the Merger, when announced, received positive feedback from the market. In respect of the fairness of the Merger Ratio, the court concluded that it was calculated in accordance with Korean law and there was no evidence of market manipulation or unfair trading. The court also rejected the applicants' arguments that the NPS influenced the share price through market price manipulation or unfair trading and that SC&T's directors breached their fiduciary duties when making the discretionary business decision to approve the Merger.\n\n751.\n\nOn the issue of whether the NPS exercised its voting rights unlawfully and whether this could be a ground for the invalidation of the Merger, the court held that there was no evidence that the chairman of the NPS' board of directors who legally represented the fund was aware of the intervention of the MHW or CIO Hong in the internal decision-making process. Holding that the CEO is the relevant point of reference for determining the intent of a corporation, the court concluded that the NPS' declaration of approval of the Merger could not be considered defective. The court held that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the Investment Committee's decision in favor of the Merger involved a breach of trust. In the court's view, the appropriate merger ratio could not be determined with certainty and the circumstance that an internal calculation differed from the actual Merger Ratio did not indicate a breach of trust. The court decided that the Investment Committee enjoyed discretion whether to refer the vote to the Experts Voting Committee and that the Investment Committee adopted an open voting method which did not favor any particular outcome. While the criminal division of the Seoul Central District Court found the decision-making process within the NPS problematic, this did not mean, in the civil court's view, that the resolution itself could be considered a breach of CIO Hong's fiduciary duties. The court considered it unlikely that the decision of the Investment Committee members, who had been warned by Elliott of their personal liability, was swayed by an individual's influence or by the calculated synergy effects which they knew were unreliable and could not fully offset any losses. According to the court, the Investment Committee members who voted for the Merger appeared to have concluded that the Merger would stabilize the governance structure.\n\n752.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these conclusions do not contradict the above-mentioned factual findings of the Korean criminal courts.\n\n753.\n\n*First*, the civil court in the Merger Annulment Case did not itself take any evidence on the decision-making process within the NPS. Neither did it state in its decision that it disagreed with the factual findings of the criminal courts. Rather, the court considered them in its decision along with other evidence.\n\n754.\n\n*Second*, the court did not have access to all of the above-mentioned court decisions many of which (notably, the decision of the Seoul High Court in the Moon/Hong case, the decisions of the Seoul Central District Court and the Seoul High Court in the Park case and the decisions of the Korean Supreme Court in the JY Lee and Choi Seo-won cases) were issued after the decision in the Merger Annulment case.\n\n755.\n\n*Third*, the civil court dealt with the legal question of whether the Merger could be retroactively annulled which is different from the question of criminal liability, which the Korean criminal courts had to assess, and the question of a violation of the FTA, which this Tribunal is seized with. Consequently, the court applied different legal standards, notably when it came to the attribution of knowledge to a legal entity. Unlike in the Merger Annulment Case, the Tribunal need not decide whether the approval of the Merger by the NPS in the shareholders' meeting was legally valid. Rather, it must look at the internal decision-making process of the NPS and the Korean government, which the civil court did not consider relevant.\n\n756.\n\n*Fourth*, the conclusions drawn by the Seoul Central District Court in the Merger Annulment case on the economic viability of the Merger, any legitimate reasons for the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger and the decision on the Investment Committee not to refer the vote mainly relate to issues of causation. However, any (hypothetical) economic justification for the NPS' Merger vote cannot undo the undue interference of the Blue House and MHW in the internal decision-making process, which constitutes the violation of the FET standard as stated above.\n\n757.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that President Park's solicitation of financial benefits in exchange for her government's support of the Merger and the interference of President Park, Minister Moon and their subordinates at the Blue House and MHW in the exercise of the NPS' voting rights violate the FET standard.\n\n**c)** ***Whether Respondent's conduct violated the FPS standard***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n758.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the FPS standard covers both the physical security and legal security of investments. Having found that Respondent's conduct violates the FET standard, which, like the FPS standard, is part of the minimum standard of treatment set forth in Article 11.5 of the FTA, the Tribunal can leave this question open and need not decide whether Respondent's conduct also violates the FPS standard.\n\n**D. National treatment**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n759.\n\nClaimants submit that in interpreting the national treatment standard, tribunals have established three elements that must be satisfied for a violation to be found: (i) the respondent State must have accorded to the foreign investor or its investment, some kind of treatment with respect to the relevant investments; (ii) the foreign investor or investments must be \"in like circumstances\" to an investor or investment of the respondent State; and (iii) the treatment given to the foreign investor must have been less favorable than that accorded to the Comparator.1140\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 218.\n\n760.\n\nClaimants argue that each of the three aforementioned elements is satisfied on the evidence of this case.1141\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 219.\n\n761.\n\nFirst, defining \"treatment\" as the \"behaviour in respect of an entity or a person\", Claimants assert that \"treatment\" is a broad concept, comprising any measures undertaken by the State that bear upon the investor's business activities.1142 Relying on the dictionary definition of the \"treatment\", which means \"the action or manner of dealing with something\", Claimants contend that Respondent's interference with the Merger and its associated criminal scheme at the highest levels of the Korean government amounted to treatment to all investors impacted by the Merger.1143\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 263-265, relying on Campbell McLachlan et al., International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles (OUP, 2017) [**CLA-84**], \u00b6 7.277; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111, citing Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online), \"Treatment\", accessed on 6 October 2021 [**C-208**].\n\n762.\n\nAccording to Claimants, by interfering with the NPS's decision-making process in respect of the Merger vote as part of a corrupt scheme intended to benefit JY Lee and his family, Respondent directly interfered with Claimants' \"management\", \"conduct\", and \"operation\" of their investment in the Samsung Shares.1144 In response to Respondent's argument that Claimants were not prevented from selling their shares or operating their investments, Claimants posit that the FTA does not limit the notion of \"treatment\" to measures that effect the forced sale of an investment.1145 In this case, Claimants argue that but for Respondent's measures, their shares in SC&T would not have compulsorily merged with Cheil at a gross undervalue nor would their investment thesis with respect to SEC have been undermined.1146\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 220-221, citing *Siemens A.G. v.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n768.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have failed to satisfy the three elements required by the FTA for a national treatment claim.1156\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 415-516.\n\n769.\n\nFirst, Respondent rejects Claimants' reading of \"treatment\" as an open-ended term that comprises any and all State measures that \"bear upon\" an investor.1157 Instead, Respondent insists that the ordinary meaning the words \"accord \u2026 treatment\" requires some State conduct to be directed towards an investor or its investment\".1158 Further, noting that the FTA expressly limits the national treatment obligation to \"treatment \u2026 with respect to the establishment, acquisition, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investment\", Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to identify under which of these exclusive bases the Korean government did not accord \"treatment\" to Claimants or their investments.1159 In this respect, Respondent highlights that this specific requirement is not found in Article 11.5 of the FTA, presenting a distinct limitation on the scope of its national treatment obligation.1160\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 443.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 443.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 409, 411; Rejoinder, \u00b6 444.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 444.\n\n770.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it is undisputed that Respondent had no interactions with Claimants regarding their shareholding in the Samsung Group and that none of the disputed measures was directed at them.1161 In particular, Respondent notes that none of the impugned measures hampered Claimants' right to sell its shares nor interfered with their right to manage and operate the investments in SC&T and SEC.1162 Therefore, Respondent takes the view that the NPS's Merger vote, and the alleged conduct leading to that vote, was unrelated and does not constitute \"treatment\" of Claimants under Article 11.3 of the FTA.1163\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 442.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 412; Rejoinder, \u00b6 445.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 445.\n\n771.\n\nRelying on the NAFTA tribunals which interpreted the identical limitation on the \"treatment\" requirement, Respondent adds that the NPS's vote on the Merger was a purely commercial act of which the NPS exercised its private shareholder rights in SC&T, and thus was not a \"regulatory measure applied to Mason's business\" to qualify as the distinct \"treatment\" requirement in Article 11.3 of the FTA.1164\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 413, referring to *Mrrill & Ring Forestry L. P. v. The Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award, 31 March 2010 [**CLA-119**], \u00b6 79.\n\n772.\n\nSecond, Respondent considers the use of the Lee family as a comparator inappropriate for a \"like circumstances\" analysis because the Lee family consists of an undefined and diverse collection of individuals with distinct investment profiles, united only in their familial ties to one another.1165 By way of example, Respondent points out that JY Lee, unlike Claimants, held a substantial stake in Cheil but not in SC&T as of 1 June 2015.1166\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 418.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 450.\n\n773.\n\nConsequently, since the Lee family had different shareholders in SC&T, Cheil and other companies in the Samsung Group, Respondent emphasizes that the Lee family had different interests in the outcome of the Merger vote than that of Claimants.1167 Without defining the members of the Lee family, Respondent asserts that Claimants therefore have not substantiated their assertion that both Claimants and the Lee family are appropriate comparators as shareholders in SC&T and SEC.1168 In the same vein, Respondent maintains that Claimants have failed to prove that all members of the Lee family stood to gain from the Merger or were directly impacted by Korea's alleged measures.1169\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 456.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 450.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 451.\n\n774.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent submits that the more alike comparator that are in the most \"like circumstances\" are all Korean investors, who owned shares in SC&T but not in Cheil.1170 This is because investors that owned both SC&T and SEC necessarily had different and more complex interests than investors that owned shares only in SC&T.1171 As a result, the \"economic sector\" that was \"dependent\" on the NPS's Merger vote (for the purposes of a national treatment analysis) were all Korean shareholders of SC&T who were not also shareholders of Cheil, rather than just certain members of the Lee family.1172\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 420-421, relying on *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005 [**RLA-96**], \u00b6 19; Rejoinder, \u00b6 454.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 452.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 421. See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 453.\n\n775.\n\nAs observed by the United States, Respondent underscores that the national treatment obligation does not entitle U.S. investors to \"the best level of treatment available\" to any Korean investors in any circumstances, but is designed to treat foreign investors no less favorably than domestic investors.1173 Therefore, even if domestic investors were \"wronged\" by the State, Respondent contends that the treaty obligation does not entitle foreign investors to be treated better than the domestic investors in like circumstances.1174 Any more favorable treatment that the Lee family purportedly received from the Merger is also irrelevant because the Lee family was not in the same position as Claimants or other Korean SC&T shareholders who did not own shares in Cheil.1175\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 460, referring to U.S. Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 458-459.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 461.\n\n776.\n\nThird, Respondent argues that Claimants were not treated any less favorably than the Lee family or other Korean investors in SC&T, who did not own shares in SEC.1176 In this respect, Respondent submits, with reference to *Pope & Talbot*, that when domestic investors in \"like circumstances\" are treated the same way as the foreign investors, there can be no \"less favorable\" treatment and, thus, no violation of the national treatment obligation.1177\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 427.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 425, referring to *Pope & Talbot v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits Phase 2, 10 April 2001 [**CLA-129**], \u00b6 87.\n\n777.\n\nAccording to Respondent, there were multiple Korean investors, who, like Claimants, owned shares in SC&T but not in Cheil, and were in the same position as Claimants at the time of the Merger.1178 These Korean investors include institutional investors, as well as individuals who sought unsuccessfully to annul the Merger in the Korean courts.1179 To the extent that Claimants suffered any harm from the Merger, Respondent asserts that these Korean investors would have suffered the same harm.1180\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 426.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 426. See Plaintiffs in Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017 [**R-242**]; Applicants/Appellants in Seoul High Court Case No. 2016Ra20189 (Consolidated), 30 May 2016 [**C-115**]. See also above at \u00b6269.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 427; Rejoinder, \u00b6 457.\n\n778.\n\nLastly, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to prove that the NPS's decision on the Merger was motivated by an intent to discriminate against foreign investors.1181\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 428.\n\n779.\n\nAs a threshold matter, Respondent, relying on *S.D. Myers v. Canada*, rejects Claimants' assertion that the existent of a discriminatory alone, without any actual adverse treatment of foreign investors, is sufficient to establish a violation under the FTA.1182 Respondent further clarify that the tribunal in *Corn Products v. Mexico*\u2014the single case Claimants cite in support of its position\u2014held that the proven intention was \"decisive\" only for the \"third part\" of the test, i.e., whether the host State had afforded the claimant \"less favorable\" treatment.1183\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 429, referring to *S.D. Myers v. Canada* [**RLA-93**], \u00b6 254.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 430, referring to *Corn Products International, Inc. v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/01, Decision on Responsibility, 15 January 2008 [**CLA-6**], \u00b6\u00b6 117, 138.\n\n780.\n\nIn any event, Respondent argues that none of the evidence cited by Claimants establish that the NPS was driven with an intent to discriminate against foreign investors, given that there were multiple U.S. shareholders of Cheil that benefited as a result of the NPS's vote.1184 Likewise, the fact that there were multiple foreign SC&T shareholders who supported the Merger and Korean SC&T shareholders who opposed the Merger underlines the lack of nexus between Respondent's alleged conduct and the nationality of SC&T and Cheil shareholders.1185\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 432.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 433; Rejoinder, \u00b6 462.\n\n781.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the evidence at best establish that Respondent supported the Merger in response to the predatory conduct of a narrow class of U.S. hedge funds and the harm that conduct might cause to the Korean economy.1186 In particular, noting that the Elliott Group was known for its short-term hit-and-run trading, Respondent asserts that the alleged comments by President Park and Blue House officials only reflect their belief that the approval of the Merger was in the best interests of the Korean economy in light a highly publicized campaign waged by the Elliott Group against the Merger.1187 This specific reaction to a very specific threat emanating from a U.S. hedge fund, according to Respondent, cannot be taken under international law standards as evidence of discriminate intent against all U.S. investors in violation of the FTA.1188\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 463.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 435; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 463(b), (c), (e), 464.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 436.\n\n**3. U.S. submission**\n----------------------\n\n782.\n\nThe United States submits that Article 11.3 of the FTA is not intended to prohibit all differential treatment among investors or investments but is designed to prohibit nationality-based discrimination.1189 Nationality-based discrimination may be *de jure* (facially discriminatory) or *de facto* (facially neutral, but on its application is discriminatory based on nationality).1190 A claimant is not required to establish discriminatory intent.1191\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\n783.\n\nAccording to the United States, to establish a breach of national treatment under Article 11.3, a claimant has the burden of proving that it or its investments (i) were accorded \"treatment\"; (ii) were in \"like circumstances\" with domestic investors or investments; and (iii) received treatment \"less favorable\" than that accorded to domestic investors or investments\".1192 The United States notes that the analysis of whether a claimant is in \"like circumstances\" with comparators is a context-dependent, fact-specific inquiry, where the claimant or its investment should be compared to a domestic investor or investments that is alike in all relevant respects but for nationality of ownership.1193 Specifically, the United States \"understands the term 'circumstances' to denote conditions or facts that accompany treatment as opposed to the treatment itself\".1194\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\n784.\n\nThe United States submits that the analysis of whether treatment is accorded in \"like circumstances\" under Article 11.3 depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or investments based on legitimate public welfare objectives.1195 According to the United States, nothing in Article 11.3 requires that a foreign investor or its investments, regardless of the circumstances, be accorded the best, or most favorable, treatment given to any domestic investor or investment; the appropriate comparison is between the treatment accorded a foreign and a domestic investor or investment in like circumstances.1196 As a result of this \"important distinction intended by the [Contracting] Parties\", a host State may adopt measures that distinguish among entities without violating Article 11.3.1197\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\n**4. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n785.\n\nArticle 11.3 of the FTA provides:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.3: NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.1198\n\nTreaty [**CLA-23**], Art. 11.3.\n\n786.\n\nThe Parties concur that the following three elements must be satisfied in order for a violation of the national treatment standard to be found under Article 11.3 of the FTA:\n\n(a) The \"treatment\" in question must be with respect to the \"establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investment\";\n\n(b) Claimants or their investments must be in \"like circumstances to an investor or investment in Korea; and\n\n(c) Claimants or their investments must have been accorded treatment that was \"less favorable\" that that accorded to an appropriate comparator.1199\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 218; Statement of Defense, \u00b6 415.\n\n787.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent violated the national treatment standard by discriminating against Claimant and their investments in favor of the Lee family.1200\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 227.\n\n788.\n\nFor the same reasons as those discussed in the context of Article 11.5 of the FTA, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent's argument that it did not \"accord\" Claimants any \"treatment\" within the meaning of Article 11.3 of the FTA.\n\n789.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimants and their investments were in like circumstances to the Lee family and their shareholding in SC&T. To begin with, the Lee family is comprised of individuals with different shareholdings. For example, JY Lee was only a shareholder in Cheil but not in SC&T as of 1 June 2015, whereas his father held shares both in SC&T and Cheil.1201 In the Tribunal's view, the more alike comparator to Claimants is the Korean investors who held shares in SC&T but not in Cheil. However, their investments were affected by Respondent's conduct in the same way as Claimants' investments.\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2016Ra20189 (Consolidated), 30 May 2016 [**CLA-115**], p. 11.\n\n790.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides that Respondent did not accord Claimants' investments treatment that was less favorably than that it accorded to domestic investments in like circumstances. Respondent did not violate the national treatment standard under Article 11.3 of the FTA.\n\n**VII. CAUSATION**\n------------------\n\n791.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the standards and requirements of factual and legal causation arising out of Article 11.16(a)(ii) of the FTA. Based on their interpretation of the standards and requirements of causation, Claimants contend that it has been demonstrated that Respondent caused Claimants' losses in fact and in law. Respondent, in contrast, contends that Claimants have not demonstrated that Respondent's alleged breach caused Claimants' losses neither in fact nor in law.\n\n**A. Standards and Requirements of Causation**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n**a)** ***Causation in fact***\n------------------------------\n\n792.\n\nClaimants dispute Respondent's argument that factual causation requires Claimants to establish a high standard of factual certainty under international law.1202 It is Claimants' position that proof of factual causation is established on a balance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence standard.1203 Claimants argue that the awards cited by Respondent, *Clayton et al v. Canada* and *Nordzucker v. Poland*, contain no suggestion that a more onerous standard should apply.1204 Claimants rely on the awards in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* and *Tethyan Copper Company v. Pakistan*, both of which, Claimants contend, found that the appropriate standard is the balance of probabilities.1205 Claimants object to Respondent's position that they must prove that but for Respondent's undue pressure, the NPS would not have approved the Merger.1206\n\nReply, \u00b6 290, referring to Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 444-448.\n\nReply, \u00b6 290; Claimants' PHB, \u00b6 94.\n\nReply, \u00b6 291, referring to *Clayton et al. v.

Ukraine* and the *Angola* case, in which the tribunals emphasized the concept of foreseeability.1212\n\nReply, \u00b6 312, citing U.S. Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\nReply, \u00b6 312.\n\nReply, \u00b6 312, relying on *Joseph Charles Lemire v.

See also Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, p. 1013:6-16 [Claimants' Closing Submission].\n\n796.\n\nIn support of this position, Claimants point to the decision in *Lemire v. Ukraine*, which states that \"[i]f it can be proven that in the normal cause of events a certain cause will produce a certain effect, it can be safely assumed that a (rebuttable) presumption of causality between both events exists, and that the first is the proximate cause of the other\".1215 Accordingly, relying further on examples from the ICJ and other tribunals, Claimants conclude that having multiple links in the chain of causation or other concurrent causes of the losses does not render Respondent's conduct too remote from Claimants' losses.1216\n\nReply, \u00b6 314, citing *Lemire v.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n**a)** ***Causation in fact***\n------------------------------\n\n797.\n\nRespondent contends that international law requires that Claimants satisfy a high level of certainty in order to satisfy a determination of factual causation.1217 Respondent emphasizes that Claimants bear the burden of satisfying this requirement and note that both *Gemplus* and *Gavazzi* confirm this rule.1218 Relying on *Clayton et al v. Canada*, Respondent maintains that Claimants must demonstrate that, but for Respondent's conduct, \"it would 'in all probability' or 'with a sufficient degree of certainty' have suffered the losses that it claims\".1219 Respondent argues that this high standard of factual certainty would not be met where the counterfactual scenario, in which the loss would not have happened, rests on several contingent outcomes or factual assumptions.1220 On this point, Respondent also relies on *Nordzucker v. Poland*, where the tribunal did not find factual causation because the investor relied on multiple speculative assumptions.1221\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 444-445; Rejoinder, \u00b6 471.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 76, referring to *Gemplus v.

Poland* used an even stricter standard, requiring that, but for Poland's conduct, the investor \"necessarily\" would have suffered losses.1223 Respondent further argues that the other investment decisions cited by Claimants do not support the argument that a balance of probabilities standard is required.1224\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 473, referring to *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (*Germany v.

Romania*, where the tribunal found that to establish that \"a sufficient causal link exists between the Respondent's breach of the BIT and the losses alleged, the Claimants must prove \u2026 that the dominant cause [of the loss] was the [breach] of the BIT\".1227 Respondent also relies on the decisions in *ELSI (USA v. Italy)*, where the ICJ dismissed compensation claims because Italy's wrongful requisition of a company was just one of the factors involved in the loss and not the \"underlying cause\".1228 Finally, Respondent cites to *Blusun v.

Ukraine* and the *Angola* case, do not equate foreseeability with proximity and do not suggest that foreseeability alone establishes legal causation, respectively.1234\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 533, citing *H.G.

Myers*, which held that there must exist a \"sufficient causal link\" between the breach of a provision and the sustained loss.1240 The United States further notes that the same tribunal clarified that \"[o]ther ways of expressing the same concept might be that the harm must not be too remote, or that the breach of the specific NAFTA provision must be the proximate cause of the harm\".1241\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 37, *relying on William Ralph Clayton & Bilcon of Delaware Inc. et al. v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n806.\n\nAccording to Article 11.16.1 (a) (ii) of the FTA, the claimant may submit to arbitration a claim for a breach of a Treaty obligation for loss or damage that it has incurred \"by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\". The Parties agree that this causation test has both a factual and a legal element.\n\n**a)** ***Causation in fact***\n------------------------------\n\n807.\n\nIt is undisputed that Claimants bear the burden of proof for establishing that Respondent's breaches were the but-for cause of Claimants' claimed losses.1243 The Parties disagree on the applicable standard of proof for factual causation, i.e., whether the \"balance or probabilities\" or \"preponderance of evidence\" standard applies or whether a \"high standard of factual certainty\" is required.\n\nReply, \u00b6 288.\n\n808.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the analysis of the *Clayton v. Canada* tribunal according to which \"[a]uthorities in public international law require a high standard of factual certainty to prove a causal link between breach and injury: the alleged injury must 'in all probability' have been caused by the breach (as in Chorz\u00f3w), or a conclusion with a 'sufficient degree of certainty' is required that, absent a breach, the injury would have been avoided (as in Genocide)\".1244\n\n*Clayton et al. v. Canada* [**RLA-174**], \u00b6 110.\n\n809.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimants must show with a sufficient degree of certainty that but for Respondent's breach, they would not have incurred their loss or damage.\n\n**b)** ***Causation in law***\n-----------------------------\n\n810.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the threshold required for establishing legal or proximate causation. Respondent submits that the proximate cause is the \"dominant,\" \"operative\" or \"underlying\" cause of impugned loss,1245 the \"last, direct act, the immediate cause\" of alleged injuries.1246 According to Respondent, Claimants must also prove that there existed no \"intervening\" or \"superseding\" cause for the damage.1247 Claimants submit that there are no such requirements under the FTA or international law.1248\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 479-482.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 483.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 483.\n\nReply, \u00b6 311.\n\n811.\n\nGiven that Korea and the United States intended to incorporate the international law doctrine of proximate causation into the FTA,1249 the Tribunal finds it helpful to look at the ILC Articles and their commentary in order to further concretise the standard of legal causation. In the commentary to ILC Article 31, it is suggested that legal causation is \"associated with the exclusion of injury that is too 'remote' or 'consequential' to be the subject of reparation\".1250\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 442; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 311-313.\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles, Article 31, cmt 10 **[CLA-166]**.\n\n812.\n\nThe commentary to ILC Article 31 emphasises that remoteness of damages \"is not a part of the law which can be satisfactorily solved by search for a single verbal formula\" and notes that international tribunals have used the criteria of directness, foreseeability or proximity to establish it, and that other factors may also be relevant.1251\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles, Article 31, cmt 10 **[CLA-166]**.\n\n813.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *Lemire v. Ukraine* tribunal that it is not the aggrieved party but rather the wrongdoer who asserts the existence of other intervening or superseding causes, who bears the burden of proof.1252 This means that Claimants must prove that the sustained loss is not too remote from the Treaty violation, whereas Respondent bears the burden of proving that the loss was caused by an intervening or superseding cause.\n\n*Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010 [**CLA-117**], \u00b6 163 fn. 158.\n\n814.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the remoteness criterion cannot be understood as requiring the aggrieved party to show that the wrongful act is the \"dominant\", \"operative\" or \"underlying cause of the loss. This would effectively reverse this allocation of the burden of proof. Neither does the claimant have to establish that the breach is the \"the last, direct act, the immediate cause\" of the claimed loss. The ILC Commentary does not say so, and, in the words of the German-Portuguese tribunal deciding the *Angola* case, \"it would not be equitable to let the injured part bear those losses which the author of the initial illegal act has foreseen [\u2026] for the sole reason that, in the chain of causation, there are some intermediate links\".1253\n\n*Angola Case* [**CLA-202**], p. 1031 (translated from French).\n\n815.\n\nTurning to what Respondent has to prove to break the chain of causation, the Tribunal considers that proof of a concurrent cause is not sufficient. The commentary to ILC Article 31 provides that in cases where \"the injury in question was effectively caused by a combination of factors, only one of which is to be ascribed to the responsible State, international practice and the decisions of international tribunals do not support the reduction or attenuation of reparation for concurrent causes, except in cases of contributory fault\".1254 According to the commentary, a concurrent cause would only be deemed to break the chain of causation if \"some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State\".1255 The Tribunal agrees with this analysis. In the Tribunal's view, Respondent must therefore prove that this concurrent cause \"ha[s] superseded the initial cause and therefore become the main cause of the ultimate harm\"1256 in order to establish that the chain of causation has been broken.\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles, Article 31, cmt 12 **[CLA-166]**.\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles, Article 31, cmt 13 **[CLA-166]**.\n\n*Lauder v. Czech Republic* **[RLA-87]**, \u00b6 234.\n\n816.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the legal causation requirement is met when the claimant proves that the loss is not too remote from the Treaty violation. The relevant factors are directness, foreseeability and proximity and can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The chain of legal causation is broken if Respondent proves that another event superseded the initial cause and became the main cause of the loss.\n\n**B. Whether Respondent factually caused Claimants' alleged losses**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n817.\n\nClaimants' position is summarized, in part, in its Amended Statement of Claim as follows:\n\nHad the NPS voted against the merger, as it should have\u2014and as it would have, had President Park, Minister Moon, CIO Hong and other NPS officials not taken part in JY Lee's corrupt scheme\u2014then the merger would not have been approved, the stock market's discount to the intrinsic value of Mason's shares in SC&T would not have been locked in, and Mason would have continued to hold its positions in SC&T and SEC in pursuance of its investment strategy. Instead, because of Korea's violations of the treaty, the premise of Mason's investment thesis was invalidated, and Mason suffered substantial damage to its investment as a result.1257\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 243. See also Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, p. 994:9-15 [Claimants' Closing Submission].\n\n818.\n\nClaimants contend that they have suffered three heads of losses as a result of Respondent's conduct that caused the Merger to proceed, namely the losses incurred from liquidating SC&T and SEC shares following the Merger approval, as well as the loss incurred by the reduction of the Incentive Allocation, caused by the damage to the value of Claimants investments, to which the General Partner would have been entitled.1258\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 246, 254, 255, 257.\n\n819.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent's conduct is the 'but for' cause of Claimants' losses because (a) the NPS would not have approved the Merger but for the conduct of Respondent, (b) Respondent subverted the NPS Investment Committee's vote, and (c) the Merger would not have been approved without the NPS voting in favor of the Merger. Claimants maintain that multiple Korean government officials subverted the NPS' procedures, fabricated the financial figures on which the NPS relied to approve the Merger, and pressured the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger.1259\n\nReply, \u00b6 31; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 59-60, 72, 79-101.\n\n**a)** ***NPS would not have approved the Merger but for Respondent's conduct***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n820.\n\nClaimants argue that if the NPS were going to vote in favor the Merger without interference, then there would be no point for Respondent to use extraordinary criminal means to subvert the NPS's decision.1260 Rather, Claimants contend that if the NPS considered the Merger in good faith, through its Special Committee, then it would have voted against the Merger.1261\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 83, 299; Claimants' PHB, \u00b6 126.\n\nReply, \u00b6 299.

it was \"mentioned only as an additional long-term effect of the [m]erger\".1361 In addition, even if the allegedly fabricated synergy effect changed the vote of four or five members, Respondent takes the view that Claimants have not proven that a majority of at least seven Investment Committee members would have voted against the Merger.1362\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 82-85;

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n859.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the analysis of factual causation can be divided into two questions:\n\n\u2022 Whether Respondent's breach caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger (**a**))\n\n\u2022 Whether the NPS' positive vote caused the Merger to be approved (**b**)).\n\n**a)** ***Whether Respondent's breach caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n860.\n\nIn order to assess how the NPS would have decided on the Merger but for Respondent's undue interference, the Tribunal considers it useful to recall the facts established by the decisions of the Korean courts in the criminal proceedings against Minister Moon and CIO Hong. These decisions provide a detailed report of the facts that took place before and at the time of the NPS's decision on the Merger.\n\n861.\n\nThe first question that arises in this context is which committee would have decided on the Merger if the Blue House and the MHW had not pressured the NPS to let the Investment Committee decide on the Merger.\n\n862.\n\nIn this regard, the Seoul Central District Court and the Seoul High Court found that on 6 July 2015, [REDACTED] the head of the Investment Strategy Division of NPSIM, [REDACTED], the head of the NPS Responsible Investment Team, and [REDACTED], the head of the NPS Research Team, briefed Cho Nam-kwon about the initial draft of the Merger analysis and their intention to refer the Merger to the Expert Voting Committee despite Minister Moon's initial instructions.1387 Thereafter, the voting pattern of the members of the Experts Voting Committee was analyzed. Only when it became clear that the Experts Voting Committee's approval of the Merger was uncertain did Minister Moon decide to bypass the Experts Voting Committee once and for all and let the Investment Committee decide on the Merger instead.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], pp. 5-6.; Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 12.\n\n863.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that one month prior to the Merger, the SK Merger had also been referred to the Experts Voting Committee. In the Tribunal's view, the two mergers are comparable and the SK Merger could be considered to set a precedent: first, in both mergers, the NPS held shareholdings in both the target and the acquiring companies; second, the target companies were arguably trading at a significant discount to their net asset value; third, both mergers raised questions as to the appropriateness of the merger ratio. The NPSIM itself acknowledged in a report that the two mergers were \"essentially identical\".1388\n\nNPS, Assessment of Referral of SK-SK C&C Merger to the Expert Voting Committee, 10 June 2015 [**C-127**], p. 2.\n\n864.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal considers it irrelevant whether it would have been within the Investment Committee's discretion under the NPS Voting Guidelines to refrain from a referral to the Experts Voting Committee and to take the decision on the Merger itself. As the record shows, the NPSIM initially considered the Merger vote to be a difficult matter which was to be decided by the Experts Voting Committee and expressed its concerns to the MHW.\n\n865.\n\nBased on these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Claimants have shown with a sufficient degree of certainty that without Respondent's interference in the NPS' internal decision-making process, the Merger vote would have been referred to the Experts Voting Committee.\n\n866.\n\nThe second question is how the Experts Voting Committee would have decided on the Merger if it had been seized of the matter.\n\n867.\n\nIn this regard, the Seoul District Court reached the conclusion that \"if [the Investment Committee] referred the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee for review and resolution, it was highly likely that the Experts Voting Committee would oppose the Merger, as it did in the SK Merger\".1389 The Tribunal agrees that it was highly likely that the Experts Voting Committee would have decided either to abstain or to vote against the Merger for the following reasons.\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017Gohap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 **[CLA-13]**, p. 5.\n\n868.\n\nFirst, on instructions by Minister Moon, a detailed analysis of the likely voting behavior of the Experts Voting Committee's members was prepared which predicted four votes in favor, four votes against and one abstention.1390 This analysis was carried out by a joint task force of the MHW and NPS in early July 2015 and postdates the external analyses of June 2015 which Respondent seeks to rely on.1391 Based on the internal analysis, Minister Moon decided to let the Investment Committee, comprised of NPS employees, decide on the Merger. If the MHW had been sufficiently confident that the Experts Voting Committee would approve the Merger, there would have been no reason for MHW to interfere in the NPS's internal decision-making. In the Tribunal's view, this is a strong indication that the Experts Voting Committee would have abstained from or voted against the Merger.\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 **[CLA-14]**, p. 13.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 94.\n\n869.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of Mr. Cho's testimony that there was uncertainty and that no one could make a prediction as to the likely outcome of the vote.1392 However, Mr. Cho is only one (former) member of the Experts Voting Committee and could only speak for himself and in hindsight, without having actually deliberated on the Merger. In the Tribunal's view, his testimony does not contradict the above-mentioned analysis prepared by the MHW and the NPS shortly before the actual Merger vote.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, 23 March 2022, p. 480:8-25 [Cross-examination of Mr. Cho].\n\n870.\n\nSecond, the Experts Voting Committee had already rejected the SK Merger. Given the parallels between the two mergers, the coincidence in time, the heightened concerns about the Merger Ratio of the current Merger and the NPS' comparatively higher stake in SC&T, it seems highly likely that the Experts Voting Committee would not have approved the current Merger either.\n\n871.\n\nThird, the Tribunal is not convinced that there were sound economic reasons, supported by reliable data, for the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger.\n\n872.\n\nUnder Article 6(1) of the NPS Voting Guidelines, the NPS was required to vote against a proposal if it goes against the interests of the fund or decreases shareholder value. In the case of mergers and acquisitions, this meant voting against a proposal if the proposal is deemed to damage shareholder value (Attachment 1 to the NPS Voting Guidelines, Section 34(1)).\n\n873.\n\nAt the time, the NPS was aware that the Merger Ratio was unfavorable to SC&T shareholders. According to the proxy advisor ISS, the Merger Ratio implied a 50% discount relative to SC&T's intrinsic value.1393 The Korean Corporate Governance Service, the NPS' own proxy advisor, noted that the Merger Ratio did not sufficiently reflect SC&T's asset value and was set \"at a level that is unreasonable to SC&T shareholders\" and recommended the NPS to vote against it.1394 The Korean Corporate Governance Service remarked:1395\n\nAs the merger ratio was determined at the point in time most unfavorable to SC&T shareholders, during the time when the PBR was at its lowest in the past five years and the merger ratio fails to provide a sufficient reflection of the asset value, the merger ratio gives rise to concerns of shareholder value impairment for SC&T.\n\nISS Report, 3 July 2015 [**C-9**], p. 2.\n\nKorea Corporate Governance Service, Analysis Report of Agenta Items of Nationally Listed Companies, 3 July 2015 [**C-192]**, p. 3.\n\nKorea Corporate Governance Service, Analysis Report of Agenta Items of Nationally Listed Companies, 3 July 2015 [**C-192]**, p. 3.\n\n874.\n\nAs held by the Seoul High Court, the NPS was aware of these external analyses.1396\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 11.\n\n875.\n\nAs stated above, the NPSIM Research Team calculated three different benchmark merger ratios, all of which resulted in losses to the NPS. The loss resulting from the difference between the actual Merger Ratio of 0.35 and the NPS' final calculation of the benchmark Merger Ratio of 0.46 amounted to KWR 138.8 billion. The NPSIM Research Team then came up with alleged synergy effects in the amount of KWR 2 trillion which, according to the Korean courts, was calculated based on an \"arbitrarily picked\" growth rate of 10 percent.1397\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 18; see also Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], fn. 12.\n\n876.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent does not deny that this calculation of alleged synergy effects was economically unfounded. Rather, it said that it would not take a position on the findings of the Korean courts and argued that the NPS' synergy effects calculation was not decisive for the Investment Committee's approval of the Merger and that the Investment Committee had been presented with other synergies as well.1398\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 171 et seq.; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 146 et seq.\n\n877.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, significant synergies between a fashion company and a construction company are not obvious and have not been proven. Insofar as Respondent seeks to rely on positive effects of the Merger on the entire Samsung Group,1399 they are based on the same document that contained the NPSIM Research Team's flawed synergy effects calculation. In the Tribunal's view, these predictions are not supported by sufficient or reliable evidence and must therefore be considered as speculative.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 505 et seq.\n\n878.\n\nThat the Merger Ratio was objectively unfavorable to SC&T shareholders is also confirmed by the expert report of Professor Wolfenzon.1400 He showed that the exchange ratio on 26 May 2015 was particularly low when compared to other merger ratios calculated under Korean law at other points times in 2015.1401 Furthermore, Professor Dow testified at the Hearing that he considered it likely that the NPS would have voted against the Merger.1402\n\nFirst Expert Report of Daniel Wolfenzon, 23 April 2021 (\"**First ER Wolfenzon**\") [**CER-5**], \u00b6\u00b6 46 et seq.\n\nFirst ER Wolfenzon [**CER-5**], Figure 4.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 4, 24 March 2022, p. 767:6-16 [Cross-examination of Professor Dow].\n\n879.\n\nBased on the above-mentioned factual circumstances, the criminal division of the Seoul Central District Court concluded in the Moon/Hong case that \"there were multiple events that objectively suggest the contention that the merger ratio announced by Samsung was unfair and unfavorable to the SC&T shareholders\".1403 By contrast, as summarized above, the civil division of the Seoul Central District Court decided in the Elliott injunction case that the Merger Ratio was calculated in accordance with Korean law and in the Merger Annulment Case that the purpose of the Merger could not be considered unfair. However, the Tribunal is not convinced by the civil court's conclusions on the economic viability of the Merger. In the Tribunal's view, they are not supported by sufficient and concrete evidence to show that the losses caused by the Merger Ratio which was objectively unfavorable to SC&T shareholders could be recouped in the long term. In particular, the Tribunal is not satisfied that it is likely that the Merger would have enabled SC&T to significantly increase its earnings. Similarly, the fact that the Merger may have received positive market reactions cannot be taken as an indication of its long-term economic viability for SC&T's shareholders.\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 3.\n\n880.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Cho acknowledged in his testimony that if the Experts Voting Committee had deliberated, it would have considered both positions on the merger and if it was shown that the Merger would damage shareholder value, it would have been the right decision for the Experts Voting Committee to reject it.1404 For the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal is convinced that the Merger was detrimental to the value of SC&T's shares and that when considering the positions of both sides impartially and independently, the Experts Voting Committee would have, in all probability, abstained from or voted against the Merger.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, 23 March 2022, pp. 498:23-499:3, 510:19-25 [Cross-examination of Mr. Cho].\n\n881.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimants have shown with a sufficient degree of factual certainty that Respondent's breach caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger.\n\n**b)** ***Whether the NPS vote caused the Merger to be approved***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n882.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question whether, had the NPS voted against the Merger or abstained, the Merger would still have been approved.\n\n883.\n\nThe NPS was a minority shareholder of SC&T with a total shareholding of 11.21% which made the NPS the single largest shareholder.1405\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6 23.\n\n884.\n\nWhile the NPS' vote alone did not allow the Merger to pass the threshold of two thirds of the attending votes, the NPS held the casting vote in the Merger. According to the First Expert Report of Mr. Duarte-Silva, the two-third majority would not have been reached if the NPS had abstained or voted against the Merger.1406 Had the NPS voted against the Merger, the Merger would have only obtained an approval rate of 56.30%. If the NPS had abstained, the approval rate would have been 64.88% and still short of the required 66.67%.\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva **[CER-4]**, Figure 1, \u00b6 24.\n\n885.\n\nThat the NPS' vote was decisive for the Merger's approval has also been confirmed by the Seoul High Court according to which \"the [NPS] came to have the de facto casting vote that would determine whether the Merger would proceed\".1407\n\nSeoul High Court, Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 [**CLA-14**], p. 7. See also Seoul High Court, Case No. 2017NO1886, 14 November 2017 **[R-243],** p. 9 and Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 [**CLA-13**], p. 4.\n\n886.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that there any reliable indications that if the NPS had voted against the Merger or abstained, other shareholders who actually abstained or voted against the Merger would have changed their votes and voted in favor of the Merger instead. In the Tribunal's view, there is no evidence to support Respondent's argument that the Lee Family would have used other (legal) means to influence the votes of institutional investors.\n\n887.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, had the NPS voted against the Merger or abstained, the Merger would have most likely been rejected by SC&T's shareholders. The NPS' vote in favor of the Merger thus caused the Merger to be approved.\n\n888.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants seek compensation for three heads of losses which they claim were caused by the approval of the Merger: a loss in the value of their SC&T shares,1408 a loss in the value of their SEC shares,1409 and a loss in the General Partner's incentive allocation.1410 The Tribunal will deal with the question of whether the alleged losses were caused by Respondent's breach of the Treaty and whether they are properly quantified in the context of quantum. At this stage, it suffices to state that the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimants would not have sold their SC&T and SEC shares shortly after the Merger but for Respondent's breach.\n\nReply, \u00b6 318.\n\nReply, \u00b6 321.\n\nReply, \u00b6 325.\n\n889.\n\nIn conclusion, and without prejudice to its determination on the proper quantification of the losses, the Tribunal decides that Respondent's interference with the NPS' exercise of its voting rights in the Merger caused Claimants' losses.\n\n**C.

Czech Republic*, Claimants argue that \"in order to sever the chain of causation, the acts of third parties must be 'so unexpected and so substantial as to have to be held to have superseded the initial cause and therefore become the main cause of the ultimate harm.'\"1415 Accordingly, Claimants submit that the Merger and Merger Ratio were well-known to Respondent, meaning that the actions of SC&T, Cheil, nor any other party did not sever the chain of causation.1416\n\nReply, \u00b6 319.\n\nReply, \u00b6 319(a), citing *Lauder v.

Claimants maintain that by altering the Merger vote concerning SC&T and participating in the corrupt scheme, Respondent knew, or ought to have known, that its actions would have ramifications for investors in other companies within the Samsung Group, particularly SEC.1423 Claimants claim that Respondent knew that the purpose of the Merger was to facilitate succession with the Lee family, allowing it to increase its control over the Samsung Group as a whole, including SEC.1424 Claimants conclude that therefore, Respondent knew that the Merger would be highly detrimental to the Samsung Group's governance and cause the losses.1425\n\nReply, \u00b6 323.\n\nReply, \u00b6 323.

It is Respondent's position that Claimants deem the Merger itself, in tandem with the Merger Ratio, to be the dominant or underlying causes of each of the three heads of losses that Claimants' claim.1428 However, Respondent maintains that the Merger and the Merger terms were brought about because of an approval by the boards and management of SC&T and Cheil, regardless of whether the purpose of the Merger was to facilitate a succession plan between members of the Lee family.1429 Respondent maintains that the claimed loss was caused by fact that the shares were traded at a discount, which was not created by Respondent, but by the market's concern that Samsung and the Lee family would push through an unfair merger.1430 Respondent therefore argues none of Claimants' losses resulted from the conduct of Respondent nor the NPS.1431 Rather, Respondent asserts instead that the conduct of Samsung and the Lee family was the dominant cause of Claimants' alleged loss on its SC&T shares.1432\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 486.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 484.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 105.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 487.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 105.\n\n899.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants' decision to liquidate its SC&T and SEC shareholdings is an \"equally 'dominant' or 'underlying' cause of its losses, as well as an 'intervening' or 'superseding' one\".1433 Respondent contends that Claimants decision to purchase SC&T shares after the announcement of the Merger, with knowledge of its ratio, is another dominant reason of its claimed losses.1434 Respondent alleges that by selling its SC&T shares in August 2015, Claimants suffered their losses through their own fault, depriving themselves of any potential upturn.1435 Respondent also notes that Claimants began to sell their SC&T and SEC shares weeks before the Investment Committee's deliberation on the Merger, demonstrating further that Claimants' own decision-making is behind their Alternative SC&T and SEC claims.1436\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 489; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 106.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 490.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 490.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 490-491.\n\n900.\n\nMoreover, relying on Expert Witness Dr. Duarte-Silva, Respondent contends that had Claimants decided to sell their SEC shares in January 2017, the time at which they identified that they would reach their price target to sell, it would have wholly eliminated the loss that they now claim by selling the shares in August 2015.1437 Relying on the argument that Claimants sold their shares in reaction to the approval of the Merger rather than the NPS' approval of the Merger, as well as the fact that Respondent was not yet aware of the alleged corruption, Respondent disputes Claimants' argument that the decision to sell their SEC shares by August 2015 followed naturally from Respondent's conduct.1438\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 491; Rejoinder, \u00b6 540.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 541-542.

Respondent claims that Claimants are merely speculating that the NPS should have foreseen that Claimants' investment thesis would be invalided by voting for the Merger, thus causing them to sell their SC&T shares1450 Even if Claimants are correct, Respondent argues that since the claim is against Respondent, Claimants' would have to show that Respondent \"knew of the 'intrinsic value' that Mason calculated for its SC&T shares, and anticipated that the NPS voting in favor of the Merger would 'invalidate' Mason's investment thesis \u2026 causing Mason to sell its SC&T shares immediately\".1451 Respondent contends that Claimants cannot in fact show this, especially since it was not known that the Merger Ratio was unfair and in any case, the Merger Ratio was just one of multiple factors assessed in order for the NPS to vote for the Merger.1452 Respondent argues that Claimants cannot show that Respondent intended to cause the loss allegedly suffered by Claimants or any other SC&T shareholder, and even if it is true that Respondent subverted the NPS' voting process to aid JY Lee's control of the Samsung Group, this does not mean that Respondent intended to transfer value from one group of shareholders to another group of shareholders.1453 Moreover, Respondent argues that since the majority of SC&T voting shareholders approved the Merger, this further demonstrates that Claimants' SC&T loss claim was not foreseeable, as there were sound economic reasons for the Merger.1454\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 549-550.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 551.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 552-553.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 554.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 555-556.\n\n907.\n\nSecond, Respondent contends that it was not reasonably foreseeable to Respondent that the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger would cause Claimants' claimed loss concerning their SEC shares.1455 Respondent disputes Claimants' contention that their decision to divest their SEC shares followed naturally from Respondent's wrongful acts.1456 Respondent contends that analyst reports at the time predicted little to no impact on SEC shares as a result of the Merger and it was otherwise not reasonably foreseeable to Respondent that investors in other Samsung Group companies would sell their shares in reaction to the Merger at a loss.1457 Respondent claims that there was no reason for the NPS to consider the impact of the Merger on other shareholders across the Samsung Group.1458 Respondent concludes that Claimants cannot show that Respondent knew or should have known that its conduct would invalidate Claimants' investment thesis, causing them to sell their shares.1459\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 557-558.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 558.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 560-561.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 562.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 564.\n\n908.\n\nFinally, for the same reasons as stated above, Respondent contends that it was not reasonably foreseeable to Respondent that the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger would cause the claimed loss of the General Partner, particularly that it would lead to lost professional fees for hedge fund managers.1460\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 565-566.\n\n**3. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n909.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal reiterates that, in order to prove legal causation, Claimants must establish that the claimed loss is not too remote from the treaty violation, the relevant factors being *inter alia* directness, foreseeability, or proximity. Respondent is allowed to break the chain of causation if it proves that another event has superseded the initial cause and became the main cause of loss.\n\n910.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Claimants seek compensation for three heads of losses caused by the approval of the Merger: (i) a loss in the value of its SC&T shares,1461 (ii) a loss in the value of its SEC shares,1462 (iii) a loss in the General Partner's incentive allocation.1463 The Tribunal will address them in turn.\n\nReply, \u00b6 318.\n\nReply, \u00b6 321.\n\nReply, \u00b6 325.\n\n**a)** ***Proximity between Respondent's breach and Claimants' loss with respect to their SC&T shares***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n911.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Korea's breach consists in the instructions given by the Korean government to the NPS to have the Merger decided and approved by the Investment Committee. According to the Seoul High Court decision, these instructions were mainly given between late June and 8 July 2015.1464\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong,14 November 2017 **[CLA-14]**, p. 22-24. See also Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017 **[R-243],** p. 29-32 and Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, , Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 8 June 2017 **[CLA-13]**, p. 5, 11, 35.\n\n912.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that several reports criticizing the fairness of the Merger ratio had been issued before 8 July 2015, including the ISS and KCGS reports.1465 The NPSIM Research Team's first report, stating that an appropriate merger ratio would be between 0.46 and 0.89, was issued on 30 June 2015.1466 Minister Moon was aware of these reports, as held by the Seoul High Court:1467\n\nAdditionally, Choi Hong-suk's text message to the MHW Manager of Office for Population Policy Lee Tae-han at 11:25 on July 6, 2015, says, \"Because the Minister looked for me concerning the SC&T case, I reported to him the opinion from ISS, etc., and Samsung's position that I received. Saying that we must prepare with great care, he ordered a few things\".\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 **[CLA-14]**, p. 41. See also Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017 **[R-243],** p. 56.\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, Prosecutor v. Moon/Hong, 14 November 2017 **[CLA-14]**, p. 41.

See also Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017 **[R-243],** p. 30.\n\n913.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is satisfied that the loss in the value of Claimants' SC&T shares was foreseeable for Respondent at the time of the breach.\n\n914.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the fact that the Merger and the Merger Ratio were suggested by the management boards of SC&T and Cheil severed the chain of causation. While this may be considered a concurrent cause, it has certainly not become the superseding cause of harm. As a matter of fact, Respondent's breach is a more recent and direct cause. Had the Korean government refrained from giving any instructions to the NPS in relation to the Merger, the Merger would in all probability have been rejected, and the harmful consequences of the determination of an unfair ratio would therefore have been avoided.\n\n915.\n\nNeither is the Tribunal convinced by Respondent's argument that Claimants' losses are too remote from Respondent's breach because the NPS did not owe a duty of care to the other shareholders. Claimants are not seeking to hold the NPS liable for the breach of a duty of care vis-\u00e0-vis other shareholders under Korean law. Rather, they invoke a breach of the FTA. Insofar as the Commentary to ILC Article 31(1) suggests that the harm caused must be within the ambit of the rule which was breached, having regard to the purpose of that rule,1468 it refers to the international obligations under the FTA. The Tribunal is satisfied that the harm caused to Claimants is within the ambit of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 11.5 of the FTA. By contrast, the absence of liability of the NPS under Korean law does not extinguish Respondent's liability under international law.\n\nCommentaries on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Art. 31, fn. 465.\n\n916.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal's finding that the NPS' conduct is not attributable to Respondent does not mean that the NPS' conduct has become a superseding cause breaking the chain of cause. The undue interference of the Korean government was directed at influencing the NPS' vote. Under these circumstances, the NPS' conduct cannot be severed in causal terms from the conduct attributed to Respondent.\n\n917.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that Respondent's breach legally caused Claimants' loss in respect of their SC&T shares.\n\n**b)** ***Proximity between Respondent's breach and Claimants' loss in respect of their SEC shares***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n918.\n\nAs stated above, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants' decision to sell their SEC shares shortly after the Merger was factually caused by Respondent's conduct as Claimants decided to liquidate their entire positions in both SC&T and SEC following the Merger approval.\n\n919.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that on the jurisdictional issue of whether Respondent's measures \"relate to\" Claimants' investments, it decided based on the facts alleged by Claimants that there is a sufficient nexus between Respondent's measures and Claimants' investments in their SEC shares that is not merely tangential or coincidental.\n\n920.\n\nIn the context of legal causation, the Tribunal must now examine the facts alleged by Claimants.\n\n921.\n\nWhile it is Claimants' view that SEC's share price was directly affected by the Merger between SC&T and Cheil because the Merger \"drove down the price of the securities of all of the other Samsung companies, including SEC\",1469 this view is based on their subjective investment thesis according to which the rejection of the Merger would have led to corporate governance reforms across different Samsung entities and unlocked the intrinsic value not just of SC&T but also of SEC.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 190.\n\n922.\n\nRespondent was not aware of this investment thesis and could not have reasonably foreseen that investors in Samsung Group entities other than SC&T and Cheil would sell their shares in response to the Merger's approval and would suffer losses in doing so.\n\n923.\n\n*First*, SEC did not hold any shares in SC&T but rather SC&T held a stake in SEC. The market capitalization of SEC was substantially larger than that of SC&T.1470 From the perspective of an objective market participant, it was therefore unlikely that the SEC share price would be sensitive to the approval or rejection of the SC&T-Cheil Merger.1471 This is in line with contemporaneous analyst reports which Claimants received and which predicted little to no impact of the Merger on the SEC share price.1472 Any losses that Claimants might have incurred by selling their SEC shares after the Merger were therefore not foreseeable to Respondent.\n\nMarket capitalization [**DOW-WP2**], tab \"Market Cap\".\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6 196(b).\n\nEmail from [REDACTED] (Macquarie) to [REDACTED], 26 May 2015 [**DOW-134**]; email from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], 1 June 2015 [**R-398**] with an attached Macquarie Research papier stating that they \"do not expect any material impact on Samsung Electronics\".\n\n924.\n\n*Second,* SEC, as a corporation, was not affected by the Merger in any way. Contrary to SC&T, SEC continued trading long after the Merger between SC&T and Cheil was completed. Any loss that the Merger approval might have caused to the share price of SEC was therefore not set in stone. Corporate governance reforms at SEC could have been implemented independent of the outcome of the Merger between SC&T and Cheil and could have resulted in the share price increase which Claimants assumed in their investment thesis. In light of this, it was Claimants' decision to sell their SEC shares shortly after the Merger that locked in any potential losses. In the Tribunal's view, this superseding event severed the chain of causation.\n\n925.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, the Tribunal considers any losses resulting from Claimants' decision to sell their SEC shares following the Merger approval to be too remote from the Treaty violation. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Respondent's breach did not legally cause Claimants' losses with respect to their SEC shares.\n\n**c)** ***Proximity between Respondent's breach and Claimants' loss in respect of the General Partner's incentive allocation***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n926.\n\nHaving found that Respondent's breach legally caused Claimants' losses in respect of their SC&T shares, the Tribunal is of the view that it also was foreseeable for Respondent that its breach would not only affect the value of the shares but, as a corollary of that, also the General Partner's incentive allocation in respect of those shares.\n\n927.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent's breach of the FTA caused Claimants' losses with respect to their SC&T shares both in factual and in legal terms. By contrast, any losses incurred by Claimants with respect to their SEC shares are too remote from the Treaty violation and were not legally caused by it.\n\n**VIII. QUANTUM**\n-----------------\n\n928.\n\nThe Parties concur that, once causation is established, Claimants would be entitled to full reparation for the losses resulting from Respondent's violations of the FTA in accordance with the principle set out in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*.1473\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 234-235, referring to *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

See also Reply, \u00b6 326.\n\n929.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree regarding the quantification of Claimants' alleged losses, notably (i) whether Claimants satisfied their burden of proving their losses; (ii) whether the General Partner is entitled to compensation for the losses sustained by the Limited Partner; (iii) if so, the appropriate valuation methodology in calculating the fair market value of the Samsung Shares; and (iv) whether Claimants failed to mitigate their losses in accordance with international law.1474 In support of their positions, Claimants rely on the valuation approach and analyses evaluated by Dr. Tiago Duarte-Silva and Professor Daniel Wolfenzon;1475 Respondent relies on expert reports prepared by Professor James Dow and Professor Kee-Hong Bae.1476\n\nSee Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 499-500; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 326-329.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 245-246.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 503; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 570-571.\n\n**A.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n936.\n\nIt is undisputed that the burden of proving losses rests on Claimants.\n\n937.\n\nAs to the evidentiary threshold, the Tribunal considers that the existence and extent of loss must be established with sufficient probability.1491 While \"speculative or uncertain\" losses are not recoverable, the Tribunal is not convinced that certainty can be required to prove loss. Rather, it is the Tribunal's task to \"make the best estimate that it can of the amount of the loss, on the basis of the available evidence\".1492\n\n*Kardassopoulos v.

General Partner's entitlement to compensation for the losses sustained by the Limited Partner**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n939.\n\nClaimants submit that the General Partner is entitled to recover its losses to its investment in the Samsung Shares which it \"owned and controlled\" under the express terms of the FTA.1493 Conversely, limiting the General Partner's damages only to its lost Incentive Allocation, in Claimants' view, would not give effect to the principle of full compensation under international law because, as expressly confirmed in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* and *Bridgestone v. Panama*, any liabilities to third parties that a claimant may have do not impact on the compensation payable by the respondent.1494\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 378, 382.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379, referring to *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

See also Claimants' PHB, \u00b6 200.\n\n940.\n\nClaimants consider Respondent's argument that Article 11.16.1 of the FTA grants standing and relief only to an owner of a beneficial interest to lack merit.1495 This is because, according to Claimants, Article 11.16.1 merely provides for an investor's right to bring a \"derivative\" claim, i.e., a right for investors to make claims with respect to their \"local\" enterprises for losses suffered by those enterprises.1496 Such derivative claims, Claimants assert, is distinct from an investor's right to a claim for indirect losses.1497 Therefore, far from imposing a qualification on the right to claim compensation for any loss to an investment that is \"owned or controlled\" by an investor pursuant to Article 11.28, Claimants take the view that the expression \"on its own behalf\" in Article 11.16.1(a) is used to make provision for the right to bring a derivative claim \"on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent\" in Article 11.16.1(b), which is not otherwise provided for under the FTA.1498\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 383-384.\n\nReply, \u00b6 384.\n\nReply, \u00b6 384.\n\nReply, \u00b6 384.\n\n941.\n\nIn support of their position, Claimants contend that the United States shares the same understanding that Article 1116 and 1117 of NAFTA (which are substantially similar to the Article 11.16.1(a) and (b) of the FTA) serves \"distinct purposes\", with the first providing recourse to an investor for its own damage, and the second permitting an investor to bring a claim on behalf of an investment for loss suffered by that investment.1499\n\nReply, \u00b6 385, referring to *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Submission of the United States of America, September 18, 2001 [**CLA-39**], \u00b6 6.\n\n942.\n\nClaimants further note that Respondent's reading conflicts with the *lex specialis* provided for under Article 11.28 as to the relationship between a covered investor and the assets with respect to which relief can be sought.1500 Therefore, Respondent's attempt to introduce a requirement of beneficial ownership, where none exists under the FTA, should be rejected.1501\n\nReply, \u00b6 386.\n\nReply, \u00b6 386.\n\n943.\n\nRejecting Respondent's argument that the purported limitation to compensation arises as a general principle of international law, Claimants point out that the authorities examined by the Tribunal during the preliminary objections phase have already established that the existence of any third party with an ultimate economic entitlement to the benefit of the investment is not relevant under international law in the absence of a specific requirement in the treaty.1502 In any event, Claimants contend that a \"controversial, divisive doctrine [on the issue of split beneficial and legal ownership], eschewed by eminent tribunals and scholarly writers\" can hardly be elevated to the level of a general rule of international law.1503\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 388-390, referring to *Saba Fakes v.

Ecuador* because, according to Claimants, the Annulment Committee made clear that \"international law provides no bar to recovery of damages merely because a third party has a contractual claim deriving from the investment, as is the case for the General Partner here\".1505\n\nReply, \u00b6 402.\n\nReply, \u00b6 392, referring to *Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v.

This would, Claimants emphasize, generate significant uncertainty for investors in their ability to rely on the treaty provisions.1515\n\nReply, \u00b6 401.\n\n948.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants submit that the Tribunal should reject Respondent's attempt to reduce the damages claimed by the General Partner by reference to a rule that does not exist under the FTA or international law, and that is unsupported by reasons of principle of policy.1516\n\nReply, \u00b6 402.\n\n**2. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n949.\n\nRespondent submits that under the FTA and international law, the General Partner cannot claim the economic loss sustained by the Limited Partner because the Limited Partner\u2014a Cayman-domiciled entity\u2014has no standing in this arbitration.1517 Recalling the Tribunal's decision to reserve the question on whether the General Partner's claim is \"for its own loss or tantamount to a claim on behalf of the Limited Partner\",1518 Respondent argues that that Claimants have failed \"to identify, much less quantity, what the General Partner's beneficial interest might be beyond its Incentive Allocation\".1519 Consequently, Respondent takes the position that the General Partner's claim for losses is limited to those investments in which it has a beneficial interest in the Incentive Allocation granted to it under the terms of the Partnership Agreement which, according to Respondent, amounts to approximately USD 400,000.1520\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 507; Rejoinder, \u00b6 573.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 574, citing Decision on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 282.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 515.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 573, 575; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, 21 March 2022, p. 221:15-16 [Respondent's Opening Submission].\n\n950.\n\nFirst, according to Respondent, the ordinary meaning of Article 11.6.1(a) of the FTA limits the recovery of losses to a claim brought by a claimant \"on its own behalf\" in respect of \"loss or damage\" that it has incurred, rather than by a third party.1521 For Respondent, a claimant incurs loss or damages for the purposes of this provision only when a claimant's economic interest (i.e., beneficial interest) is impacted by a Treaty breach.1522 Contrary to Claimants' contention, this interpretation, Respondent asserts, is consistent with the United States' non-disputing party submissions in cases under treaties with identical language with Article 11.16.1, including NAFTA, that an investor may recover only for the direct \"losses that were sustained by that investor in its capacity as an investor\".1523\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 508-509.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 583(b).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 584(i), citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, United States Seventh Article 1128 Submission, 6 November 2001 [**RLA-29**], \u00b6 5 and referring to *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Submission of the United States of America, 18 September 2001 [**CLA-39**], \u00b6 6.\n\n951.\n\nAs to Article 11.16.1(b) of the FTA, which, in its view, defines the \"only\" circumstance in which a claimant can bring claims on behalf of a third party, Respondent considers it inapplicable in this case as the Limited Partner whose alleged losses Claimants claim is not a host-State enterprise.1524\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 509; Rejoinder, \u00b6 583(a).\n\n952.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants' expansive reading of Article 11.16.1(a) runs afoul of the FTA's object and purpose as it broadens the scope of the investment protection to any and all nationalities by allowing Korean or U.S. investors to asserts claims on behalf of beneficial owners in third countries, similar to what the General Partner does in this case by bringing claims on behalf of a Cayman national.1525 For Respondent, its reading of Article 11.16.1 by no means allows States to expropriate or otherwise breach its undertakings to investors, as alleged by Claimants as, in the \"rare case\" where, as here, an entity has legal ownership of an investment on behalf of a third party with beneficial ownership, then the beneficial owner (not the legal owner) can bring claims if it meets the criteria set forth in Article 11.28 of the FTA.1526\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 586.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 585.\n\n953.\n\nRespondent further rejects Claimants' argument that Article 11.28 of the FTA applies as *lex specialis* and controls exclusively the relationship between a covered investor and its investment.1527 According to Respondent, nothing in Article 11.28 provides that satisfying the two definitions of \"investor\" and \"investor\" is \"sufficient, rather than necessary, to establish the scope of loss of which recovery may be sought through arbitration under Article 11.16.1\".1528\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 583(c).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 583(c), 584(b).\n\n954.\n\nTo bolster its claim, Respondent asserts that its reading of Article 11.16.1(a) that standing and relief is granted only to beneficial (not legal) owners of investments is consistent with the general principle of international law, as reflected and endorsed by a \"clear preponderance of investment tribunals\",1529 most notably by the Annulment Committee in *Occidental v. Ecuador*.1530 In response to Claimants' attempt to distinguish the General Partner from the legal interest holder in *Occidental* (i.e., OPEC), Respondent posits that:1531\n\n(a) Claimants' focus on control, specifically that the General Partner controlled 100% of the Samsung Shares, unlike OPEC which controlled 40% of investment interest, was never in dispute nor was responsive to the question whether OPEC, a legal interest holder of certain assets, may claim losses on behalf of AEC, the beneficial owner of those assets. In any event, Respondent argues that \"control is not a necessary condition of beneficial ownership\";1532\n\n(b) Similar to the relationship between the General Partner and Limited Partner in this case, OPEC entered into a contractual arrangement with AEC with respect to a participating interest in certain oil fields, while maintaining its full legal title to the oil fields;1533\n\n(c) The Limited Partner always maintained a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares acquired by the General Partner with the Limited Partner's capital regardless of whether that interest was transferred by the General Partner;1534 and\n\n(d) The fact that the General Partner has the sole capacity to institutes proceedings with respect to the Samsung Shares as a matter of Cayman law has no bearing on whether, under the FTA and international law, the General Partner can recover losses on investments of which it has no beneficial ownership.1535\n\nStatement of Defense, fn. 970; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 596-597, referring to *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v.

Zimbabwe* cited by Claimants supports Respondent's position as the tribunal, criticizing the claimants for not accurately specifying the asset's value actually attributable to the claimants, reduced the damages award in light of the claimants' partial ownership of the assets (the balance of which was owned by third parties).1538\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 591(a), referring to *Saba Fakes v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n958.\n\nIn its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal explained that there are two schools of thought on the implications of a split between legal and beneficial ownership: while the first school considers a claimant only to qualify as an investor to the extent it can prove a beneficial interest in the investment, the second school of thought argues that no such principle exists under general international investment law.1544 The Tribunal left this legal question open as it found that the General Partner had a beneficial interest in the investment due to its entitlement to an Incentive Allocation.1545 The Tribunal reserved its decision as to whether the General Partner's claim is for its own loss or is tantamount to a claim on behalf of the Limited Partner, which it considered to be an issue of quantum and which it will address now.1546\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 166-170.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 171.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 282.\n\n959.\n\nTo recall, there are two funds through which Claimants made their investments in the Samsung Shares: the Domestic Fund (which is the first claimant and to which this issue is irrelevant) and the Cayman Fund, an exempted limited partnership organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands, the General Partner of which is the second claimant in this arbitration. The Limited Partner of the Cayman Fund is an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. It is undisputed that all cash contributions to the Cayman Fund's capital were made by the Limited Partner. According to Claimants, the General Partner contributed its investment decision-making, management, and expertise.1547 Even though the General Partner acquired the Samsung Shares in the name of the Cayman Fund, it is their sole legal owner.1548\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 58; Second WS Satzinger **[CWS-4]**, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Transcript of Hearing on Preliminary Objections, Day 1, 2 October 2019, p. 190:4-16 [Cross-examination of Mr. Satzinger].\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 159.\n\n960.\n\nIn its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal made the following findings on the General Partner's beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares:1549\n\nArticle 4.06(b) of the Partnership Agreement provides, in relevant part, that \"[w]ith respect to each Capital Account of a Limited Partner, as of the end of each Fiscal Year, there shall be allocated to the Capital Account of the General Partner, as its incentive allocation \u2026 20% of \u2026 the Cumulative Net Profits preliminarily allocated to such Capital Account of such Limited Partner\" minus any management fees and expenses paid by the Limited Partner and to the extent that the \"Cumulative Net Profits\" exceed the \"Cumulative Unrecovered Net Losses\" of previous years.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this general entitlement to an Incentive Allocation represents a beneficial interest of the General Partner in the Partnership's assets. It is undeniable that the Incentive Allocation entitles the General Partner to share in the benefits of ownership of the Partnership's assets. Whenever the Partnership's assets gain in value and generate net profits above a certain watermark, the General Partner gets its share of these profits.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 179-180 (internal citations omitted).\n\n961.\n\nIndependent of which school of thought applies, the General Partner is therefore at least entitled to claim losses in the amount of its (lost) Incentive Allocation.\n\n962.\n\nIn the main phase of these arbitration proceedings, it has not been suggested that the General Partner had a beneficial interest in the Samsung Shares beyond its entitlement to an Incentive Allocation.\n\n963.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal must now decide whether the General Partner is entitled to claim all the losses incurred in respect of the Samsung Shares which it legally owns but in which it only holds a partial beneficial interest. For this, the Tribunal needs to decide whether the FTA or applicable rules of international law grant standing only to the beneficial owner, not the legal owner.\n\n964.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin its analysis with the wording of Article 11.16.1 of the FTA. The provision sets forth two different types of claims. Under sub-section (a), a \"claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim (i) that the respondent has breached (A) an obligation under Section A, \u2026 and (ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\". Under sub-section (b), a \"claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim (i) that the respondent has breached (A) an obligation under Section A, \u2026 and (ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\".\n\n965.\n\nIn Respondent's submission, the provision is comprehensive to the type of claims that can be submitted to arbitration and sub-section (b) defines the only circumstance in which a claimant can bring a claim on behalf of a third party; apart from this, a claimant may only claim for loss or damage that it incurred itself due to a Treaty breach.1550 According to Respondent, a claimant incurs loss or damage for the purposes of this article only when its economic interest (i.e., its beneficial interest) is impacted by a Treaty breach.1551\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 583.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 583.\n\n966.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Article 11.16.1 of the FTA distinguishes between claims submitted by an investor on its own behalf and claims submitted by an investor on behalf of a local enterprise domiciled in the host State which the investor owns or controls. It is undisputed that Claimants' claim does not fall within the second category of claims. However, even if these types of claims are exhaustive, this does not answer the question of what constitutes an investor's own loss or damage. Article 11.16.1 of the FTA is inconclusive on this issue.\n\n967.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the answer to this question is rather to be found in the definition of \"investment\" in Article 11.28 of the Treaty which provides in relevant part that \"investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment \u2026\". This definition describes the relationship between a covered investor and its investment. According to this provision, either ownership or control \u2013 be it direct or indirect \u2013 is sufficient to establish that link between an investor and an asset. In the Tribunal's view, Article 11.16.1 of the FTA does not add to or modify these requirements when it comes to determining the scope of loss for which recovery may be sought through arbitration.\n\n968.\n\nThe term \"ownership\" is not defined in the Treaty. In the ordinary meaning of the word, the term \"ownership\" refers to legal title. The Treaty does not distinguish between legal title and economic or beneficial rights to an asset. There is nothing in the Treaty to suggest that ownership of an asset in the sense of Article 11.28 of the FTA requires not only legal title but also a beneficial or economic interest in that asset.\n\n969.\n\nThis understanding of the term \"ownership\" is also reflected in municipal law. As the Tribunal explained in its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, the ownership of assets can only be determined by reference to the applicable domestic law.1552 Applying Korean law to the existence and scope of ownership rights in the Samsung Shares and Cayman law to the Cayman Fund's legal capacity to acquire and hold rights, the Tribunal decided that the Samsung Shares were legally owned by the General Partner, even if they were acquired in the name of the Cayman Fund.1553 It has not been suggested that legal title alone is insufficient to establish ownership under Korean law. In fact, most jurisdictions link ownership to legal title alone.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 135.\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 159.\n\n970.\n\nWhereas legal ownership is a uniformly accepted concept that can be determined by reference to municipal law, there is no common definition or understanding of \"beneficial ownership\". In many cases, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to identify the parties that have a beneficial interest in an investment.\n\n971.\n\nAgainst this background, the term \"ownership\" must be understood in its ordinary meaning as referring to legal title in accordance with Article 31(1) VCLT. There is no basis for reading an additional, undefined requirement of a beneficial interest into the Treaty.\n\n972.\n\nConsequently, the Treaty does not contain any requirement that a claimant must establish a beneficial interest in the covered investments. Under the Treaty, the legal owner has the right to bring a claim regardless of whether he is also the beneficial owner of the investment.\n\n973.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the question whether there is a general principle of international law which grants standing and relief under investment treaties only to beneficial (and not to merely legal) owners of investments.\n\n974.\n\nTo this end, the Tribunal first analyses whether there is a customary rule of international law to this effect, before turning to the subsequent question of whether there is scope for the application of such a rule in the light of the express provisions of the Treaty.\n\n975.\n\nAs stated above, the burden of establishing a custom under international law rests on the party invoking it, i.e., Respondent. Respondent submits that such principle was prominently articulated by the *Occidental v. Ecuador* annulment committee which decided:1554\n\nIn cases where legal title is split between a nominee and a beneficial owner international law is uncontroversial: as Arbitrator Stern has stated in her Dissent the dominant position in international law grants standing and relief to the owner of the beneficial interest \u2013 not to the nominee.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, 2 November 2015 [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 259.\n\n976.\n\nThe annulment committee held that this is a \"reflection of a more general principle of international investment law: claimants are only permitted to submit their own claims, held for their own benefit, not those held (be it as nominees, agents or otherwise) on behalf of third parties not protected by the relevant treaty\".1555\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, 2 November 2015 [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 262.\n\n977.\n\nThe first part of this suggestion that claimants are only permitted to submit their own claims is indeed uncontroversial. However, the second part of the proposal that an investor's claim must be for its own (economic) benefit is far from uncontroversial.\n\n978.\n\nThe distinction between own claims and third-party claims was already made by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision:1556\n\nApart from these preliminary objections, the Parties are at issue as to the amount and method of payment of any compensation which may be awarded. In these circumstances, the Court must first of al1 consider whether damage affording ground for reparation has ensued as regards not only the Bayerische but also the Oberschlesische. [\u2026] On approaching this question, it should first be observed that, in estimating the damage caused by an unlawful act, only the value of property, rights and interests which have been affected and the owner of which is the person on whose behalf compensation is claimed, or the damage done to whom is to serve as a means of gauging the reparation claimed, must be taken into account. This principle, which is accepted in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals, has the effect, on the one hand, of excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from the unlawful act and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzow undertaking is therefore equivalent to the total value-but to that total only-of the property, rights and interests of this Company in 'that undertaking, without deducting liabilities.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland*), Decision on the Merits, 13 September 1928, PCIJ, Rep. Series A, No. 17 [**CLA-1**], pp. 30-31.\n\n979.\n\nIn other words, a claimant is only entitled to compensation for damage caused by an unlawful act to the property, rights, and interests that it owns. While the claimant may not claim compensation for injury inflicted to third parties, it need not deduct any debts or other obligations for which it is responsible to third parties from the damage.\n\n980.\n\nContrary to what the *Occidental v. Ecuador* annulment committee said,1557 the *Chorz\u00f3w* decision does not support the conclusion that under international law, only the beneficial owner may be compensated. Similar to Article 11.16.1 of the FTA, the above-mentioned distinction between third-party claims and obligations vis-\u00e0-vis third parties does not provide an answer to the question of whether a legal owner may only claim compensation for injury caused to its investment to the extent that it also holds a beneficial interest in it.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, 2 November 2015 [**RLA-21**], \u00b6 291.\n\n981.\n\nIf anything, the reasoning in *Chorz\u00f3w* rather suggests that the Permanent Court of Justice only considered legal, but not beneficial, ownership relevant for the assessment of damages. One of the arguments put forward by the Polish government was that the German Reich effectively owned the shares in Oberschlesische, which is the company that owned the *Chorz\u00f3w* factory. The legal owner of the shares in Oberschlesische was another German limited liability company called Treuhand. That company pledged its shares in Oberschlesische to the German Reich as security for outstanding debts. The German Reich thus had a lien on the shares in Oberschlesische and all the rights associated with the possession of the shares. On that basis, the Polish government argued that the German Reich was the owner of the shares in Oberschlesische. The Permanent Court of Justice rejected the argument of the Polish government holding that only legal ownership was relevant:1558\n\n[T]he Court points out that the Treuhand, and not the Reich, is legally the owner of the shares of the Oberschlesische. The Reich is the creditor of the Treuhand and in this capacity has a lien on the shares. It also has, besides this lien, all rights resulting from possession of the shares, including the right to the greater portion of the price in the event of the sale of these shares. This right, which may be regarded as preponderating, is, from an economic standpoint, very closely akin to ownership, but it is not ownership; and even from an economic point of view it is impossible to disregard the rights of the Treuhand.\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland*), Decision on the Merits, 13 September 1928, PCIJ, Rep. Series A, No. 17 [**CLA-1**], p. 39.\n\n982.\n\nIn support of its suggestion that international law grants standing to the beneficial owner, rather than the legal owner, the *Occidental v. Ecuador* annulment committee referred to the customary international law rules on diplomatic protection.1559 Independent of whether there is still a rule granting standing only to the beneficial owner in the field of diplomatic protection,1560 the Tribunal considers that the rules on diplomatic protection are of limited guidance in the context of international investment law. This has also been confirmed by the ICJ in *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo)*:1561\n\nThe Court is bound to note that, in contemporary international law, the protection of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as the treaties for the promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which created an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty r\u00e9gimes do not exist or have proved inoperative.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, 2 November 2015 [**RLA-21**], \u00b6\u00b6 260-261, 277.\n\nCf.

Democratic Republic of the Congo)*, Judgment, 24 May 2007 [**CLA-26**], \u00b6 88.\n\n983.\n\nThe case law of claims commissions, such as the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, concerns different legal instruments and cannot establish the existence of a general principle of international investment law.1562 In the *Saghi* decision cited by Professor Stern's dissenting opinion, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal recognized that its \"concern for beneficial interests flows naturally from the terms of the Algier Accords\", in particular the purpose of both Parties to settle and terminate all claims between the government of each party and the nationals of the other, and that the \"evident purpose of these claims settlement arrangements could not be fully implemented unless the Tribunal's jurisdiction were broad enough to permit the beneficial owners of affected property interests to present their claims\".1563\n\nCf. *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, September 12, 2014 [**CLA-37**], \u00b6 523.\n\n*James M.

Ecuador* annulment committee's decision and Professor Stern's dissenting opinion cited do not support the existence of a general principle of international investment law either:\n\n\u2022 *Impregilo v. Pakistan* concerned an unincorporated joint venture in which legal and beneficial ownership, liability, and control were divided proportionally among the members. The tribunal decided that a joint venture member may not bring a claim on behalf of the unincorporated joint venture or other joint venture members.1564 The decision merely confirms the uncontested principle that an investor may not bring a claim on behalf of a third party but does not address the pertinent question of whether international law grants standing only to the beneficial owner of an investment.\n\n\u2022 *PSEG v. Turkey* dealt with the recoverability of pre-investment expenses incurred by third parties on behalf of the claimants. The tribunal held that while these third parties might have a claim against the claimants based on inter-company arrangements, the claimants could not hold the respondent State liable for such expenses incurred by third parties.1565 Again, the decision does not address the issue of beneficial ownership.\n\n\u2022 In *Mihaly v. Sri Lanka,* the claimant was a corporation organized under the laws of California and a partner in an unincorporated partnership with a Canadian counterpart. The claimant argued that under Californian law, it was empowered to file a claim on its own behalf and on behalf of its other partner. The tribunal decided that the claimant could only bring a claim on its own behalf because the \"existence of an international partnership, wherever and however formed, could neither add to nor subtract from, the capacity of the Claimant [\u2026] file a claim against the Respondent for whatever rights or interests it may be able to substantiate on the merits in connection with the proposed power project\".1566 The decision does not deal with the question of legal or beneficial ownership of the partnership's assets; rather, it merely addresses the procedural aspect that under international law, one partner may not bring a claim on behalf of the other partner by virtue of a partnership agreement.\n\n\u2022 *Siag v. Egypt* concerned the expropriation of a parcel of land that the claimant had acquired from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism. The sales contract provided that in case of a subsequent transfer of the land, Egypt would be entitled to 50% of the value of the land. The tribunal held that immediately prior to the expropriation, the claimant's beneficial interest in the property was only 50%. The tribunal granted compensation only for that interest in the property.1567 The case concerned a particular situation \u2013 a contractual obligation of the claimant to pay half of any sales proceeds, including any compensation received for an expropriation, to the respondent State. The tribunal based its decision solely on the interpretation of the sales agreement and did not discuss or refer to any general principles of international law.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005 [**RLA-6**].\n\n*PSEG Global, Inc. and Konya Ingin Electrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v.

Egypt* [**RLA-8**], \u00b6\u00b6 578-584.\n\n985.\n\nNor do the additional investment cases relied upon by Respondent support a general principle of international investment law:\n\n\u2022 In *Blue Bank v. Venezuela*, the tribunal found that the claimant, which was a trustee in a trust established under the Barbados International Trusts Act, did not own the assets of the trust but simply managed and administered them.1568 The tribunal concluded \"that Blue Bank has no ownership rights in respect of the assets of the Qatar Trust, that it has not brought a claim on its own behalf \u2013 whether as a nominal or beneficial owner \u2013 and that, accordingly, Blue Bank has not invested the relevant assets under the terms of the BIT\".1569 The tribunal thus declined jurisdiction because the claimant was neither the legal nor the beneficial owner of the assets. The decision does not discuss the split between legal and beneficial ownership.\n\n\u2022 In *Zhinvali v Georgia,* the claimant claimed damages both for losses incurred by itself and for losses incurred by its shareholders. The tribunal decided that the claimant did not possess the right to claim on behalf of its shareholders.1570 Again, the decision merely confirms the uncontested principle that a claimant may not submit claims on behalf of a third party but does not address the issue of legal versus beneficial ownership.\n\n\u2022 Likewise, *Khan Resources v. Mongolia*1571 and *Saluka v. Czech Republic*1572 merely restate this uncontested principle but are silent on the issue of split legal and beneficial ownership.\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Award, 26 April 2017 [**RLA-23**], \u00b6 163.\n\n*Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v.

Czech Republic* [**CLA-41**], \u00b6 244.\n\n986.\n\nConsequently, the case law of investment tribunals does not support the existence of a general principle of international investment law according to which only the beneficial owner has standing to sue.\n\n987.\n\nTurning to the question of whether such general principle, if it existed, would be applicable at all, the Tribunal notes that Article 11.16 and Article 11.28 of the FTA, set out detailed requirements for submitting a claim of an investor to arbitration.\n\n988.\n\nIn the words of the *Waste Management v. United Mexican States (I)* tribunal, \"[w]here a treaty spells out in detail and with precision the requirements for maintaining a claim, there is no room for implying into the treaty additional requirements, whether based on alleged requirements of general international law in the field of diplomatic protection or otherwise\".1573 In similar vein, the *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan* tribunal held that \"rules of customary international law applicable in the context of diplomatic protection do not apply where they have been varied by the *lex specialis* of an investment treaty\".1574\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico II* [**CLA-19**], \u00b6 85.\n\nKT Asia Inv. Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/7, Award, 3 April 2014 [**RLA-17**], \u00b6 129.\n\n989.\n\nAs stated above, Article 11.16.1 and Article 11.28 of the FTA grant standing to the legal owner regardless of whether he also has a beneficial interest in the investment. As *lex specialis*, these Treaty provisions take precedence over general principle of international law.\n\n990.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that even if a general principle of international law granting standing only to the beneficial owner existed, it would not apply in the present case given the special Treaty provisions.\n\n991.\n\nIn line with this approach, several other investment tribunals have rejected the suggestion that only the beneficial owner has standing to sue:\n\n\u2022 The *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* tribunal noted that \"the division of property rights amongst several persons or the separation of legal and beneficial ownership is commonly accepted in a number of legal systems, be it through a trust, a *fiducie* or any other similar structure\".1575 According to the tribunal, the \"separation of legal title and beneficial ownership rights does not deprive such ownership of the characteristics of an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the Netherlands-Turkey BIT\".1576\n\n\u2022 The *Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe* tribunal could \"find no requirement that beneficial ownership be proven in either the Swiss or German BITs, and sees no basis on which such a requirement should be read into the BITs\".1577\n\n\u2022 In *Flemingo v. Poland,* the tribunal rejected the respondent's argument that \"only the 'ultimate beneficiary of the investment' would be entitled to the Treaty's protection\", noting that \"the Treaty did not expressly provide for the limitation of treaty protection to the ultimate beneficiary of the investment and, therefore, such a restriction cannot be read into it\".1578\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010 [**CLA-40**], \u00b6 134.\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010 [**CLA-40**], \u00b6 134.\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic of Zimbabwe*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, Award, 28 July 2015 [**CLA-27**], \u00b6 314.\n\n*Flemingo Dutyfree Shop Private Limited v. Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 12 August 2016 [**CLA-68**], \u00b6 331.\n\n992.\n\nAs a final note on this issue, the *Occidental v. Ecuador* decision can also be distinguished on the facts. It involved a two-stage transfer: as a first step, the claimant transferred 40% interest in the \"complete bundle of 'rights and obligations'\" of the claimant to a third party pursuant to a farmout agreement. According to the agreement, the claimant was obliged to act as this third party \"shall direct, 'as if [it] were a party' to the Participation Contract 'owning legal title to a 40% interest'\". In the second phase (which was never entered), the claimant would transfer the legal title to the third party. This arrangement was devised to avoid restrictions on outright transfers without ministerial consent under Ecuadorian law.1579 In contrast to that, the Partnership Agreement in the present case provides that the management, control and conduct of the business of the partnership shall be vested exclusively in the General Partner, over which the Limited Partner has no control (Article 3.01), and that the General Partner must consent to any withdrawal of the Limited Partner from its capital account (Article 7.01).1580\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation, et al. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, 2 November 2015 [**RLA-21**], \u00b6\u00b6 194-201.\n\nSecond Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, 1 January 2013 [**C-30**].\n\n993.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes neither the FTA nor applicable rules of international law require a claimant to prove a beneficial interest in the covered investments in addition to legal ownership or control. It is the legal owner of the covered investment, not the beneficial owner, who has suffered loss or damage as a result of the respondent's breach and who is entitled to submit a claim for that loss.\n\n994.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal decides that the General Partner is entitled to recover the entire losses in respect of the Samsung Shares which it legally owns on behalf of the Cayman Fund. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument that the General Partner cannot claim the economic loss sustained by the Limited Partner.\n\n**C. Damages for Claimants' investment in SC&T**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n995.\n\nClaimants submit that they invested in the Samsung Group in the belief that the \"corporate governance would improve over time and, accordingly, that the stock market price of the Samsung Shares would align with the intrinsic, fair market value of the Samsung Group's underlying business and assets\".1581 Claimants contend that Respondent's actions in ensuring the merger was approved \"discount[ed] the intrinsic value of Mason's shares in SC&T\", causing Mason to suffer \"substantial damage\" to its investment.1582 According to Claimants, where an \"internationally wrongful act has impaired the financial value of an asset, the investor must be made whole through an award of damages for the loss in the fair market value of that asset\".1583\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 242.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 243.

According to Claimants, the alternative method effectively disregards the investment strategy that they were pursuing in favor of an assumption that they would have existed the investment immediately prior to the Merger approval.1615\n\nClaimants' Comments on Quantum, pp. 1-2.\n\n**2.

Respondent argues that \"[t]his basic and selective reliance on market prices undermines the very basis for Mason's SOTP exercise\" as they \"cannot have it both ways\" by using market prices for some companies while not looking to the share price of SC&T for its own fair market value.1649\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 523(a), referring to First ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 39, 73, Tables 3, 7; Rejoinder, \u00b6 640.\n\n1018.\n\nSecond, Respondent asserts that Dr. Duarte-Silva \"accounts for inapposite comparable companies, fails to apply an industry-specific valuation multiple to each of SC&T's trading and construction segments, and significantly overvalues (compared to contemporaneous assessments by analysts) SC&T's stake in Samsung Biologics\" when valuing SC&T's unlisted holdings.1650\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 523(b), referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 228-34; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 129-131.\n\n1019.\n\nThird, Respondent submits that Claimants' SOTP analysis fails to apply a holding company discount to the summed estimated asset value of SC&T, and this failure \"conflicts with considerable economic literature and the historical and current market experience of Korean *chaebols*\".1651\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 523(c), referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 235-241; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, pp. 1056:23-1058:12 [Respondent's Closing Submission].\n\n1020.\n\nFourth, Respondent argues that \"Mason's own evidence undermines its assumption that the share price of SC&T was on a path to reach its purported 'intrinsic value'\", asserting that there is no evidence that the Lee family would not seek still to consolidate the Samsung Group in the event that the Merger was rejected, nor is there evidence that rejecting the Merger \"would provide the impetus for a lifting of the longstanding holding company discount observed in Korean public companies\".1652 Furthermore, Respondent rejects Claimants' reliance on the consistency between Claimants' own valuation of SC&T's privately held companies and the valuations of other analysts because, Respondent argues, Claimants' \"valuation of SC&T's core operations is about 60% higher than the average analyst valuation\".1653\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 523(d), referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 140-145, 172-77, 179-189.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 642, referring to Reply \u00b6 347.\n\n1021.\n\nIn this vein, Respondent also disputes Claimants' attempts to argue that SC&T would have been set to reach its intrinsic value but for Korea's conduct.1654 Respondent maintains that the evidence upon which Claimants rely actually refers to different issues or is irrelevant to whether market discounts to SC&T's net asset value would dissipate if the Merger was rejected.1655\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 643, referring to Reply, \u00b6 347.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 643.\n\n1022.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that Dr. Duarte-Silva provides \"an alternative valuation of the 'actual value' of Mason's SC&T shareholding post-Merger derived from an SOTP analysis\" of the merged entity.1656 However, Respondent contends that this analysis \"suffers from the same unsupported assumptions that render [Mason's] 'but for' case too speculative and uncertain as to be compensable under international law\".1657\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 525, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 242-247.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 525, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 242-247.\n\n**b)** ***Claimants suffered no economic loss as a result of the Merger's approval***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1023.\n\nRespondent submits that the announcement of the Merger is what prompted Mason to invest in SC&T, with the hope that the Merger would be rejected by SC&T's shareholders.1658 Indeed, Respondent asserts that Claimants acquired their shares in SC&T \"after the Merger Announcement, when it was aware of the Merger Ratio (which had been set by Korean law), and when it was aware of the risk that SC&T and Chiel's shareholders would approve the Merger\".1659 Relying on the decision in *Rosinvest v.

According to Respondent, the impact of the Merger's approval was fully reflected in SC&T's share price at the close of trading on 17 July 2015. Respondent asserts that Claimants' selling pattern, including their unexplained delay in liquidating their position in SC&T are either irrelevant to damages or improperly inflate them.1668\n\nRespondent's Comments on Quantum, pp. 6-9.\n\n**3. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1027.\n\nIn principle, the Parties agree that if damages are awarded for Claimants' investment in SC&T, they should be calculated by comparing the fair market value of Claimants' SC&T shares \"but for\" Respondent's interference with the Merger vote with the fair market value of those shares following that intervention.1669 However, the Parties disagree on the appropriate methodology of calculating these damages.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 248; Respondent's Comments on Quantum, p. 2.\n\n1028.\n\nIn the following, the Tribunal first addresses Claimants' primary claim which is based on a SOTP valuation of Claimants' SC&T shares in the counterfactual scenario (**a**)). Thereafter, it addresses Claimants' alternative claim which is based on the trading losses that they allegedly incurred with respect to their SC&T shares as a result of Respondent's interference with the Merger vote (**b**)).\n\n**a)** ***Claimants' primary claim based on a SOTP valuation of SC&T***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1029.\n\nClaimants' primary claim is based on a calculation by their expert Dr. Duarte-Silva which compares the hypothetical fair market value of Claimants' SC&T shares \"but for\" Respondent's measures with the actual fair market value of Claimants' SC&T shares, both as of 17 July 2015 (i.e., the day of the vote of SC&T's and Cheil's shareholders on the Merger).\n\n1030.\n\nDr. Duarte-Silva determined the hypothetical fair market value of Claimants' SC&T shares in the \"but for\" scenario by adding the values of the various assets held by SC&T in a \"sum of the parts\" approach.1670 Dr. Duarte-Silva opined that the but-for fair market value of Claimants' SC&T shares could not be determined by SC&T's share price before the Merger vote because the \"stock price of SC&T prior to the vote was already affected by the possibility that the merger at the proposed Merger Ratio would be approved\" and because it \"reflected the possibility of an extraction of value from SC&T's shareholders\".1671 Dr. Duarte-Silva also referred to possible market manipulation.1672 According to Dr. Duarte-Silva's SOTP analysis, SC&T shares traded significantly below their fair market value, with the market capitalization of SC&T being USD 9.4 billion as of 16 July 2015 and the SOTP value of SC&T being USD 16.0 billion as of the same date.1673\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6 27.\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 46-50.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Dr. Tiago Duarte-Silva, 23 April 2021 (\"**Second ER Duarte-Silva**\") [**CER-6**], \u00b6\u00b6 136-140.\n\nSecond ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-6**], \u00b6 68.\n\n1031.\n\nClaimants' second expert Professor Wolfenzon shared Dr. Duarte-Silva's opinion that a SOTP analysis is the appropriate methodology for valuing SC&T and opined that there is no need for applying a further adjustment, whether a premium or a discount, in the valuation of SC&T.1674 Professor Wolfenzon further opined that the discrepancy between SC&T's market capitalization and its SOTP value was likely a result of the low Merger Ratio.1675\n\nFirst ER Wolfenzon [**CER-5**], \u00b6\u00b6 18, 54-66; Second ER Wolfenzon [**CER-7**], \u00b6\u00b6 5-49.\n\nFirst ER Wolfenzon [**CER-5**], \u00b6\u00b6 21, 37-53; Second ER Wolfenzon [**CER-7**], \u00b6\u00b6 50-57.\n\n1032.\n\nRespondent's expert Professor Dow disagreed with Dr. Duarte-Silva and Professor Wolfenzon's opinion that SC&T's share price on 17 July 2015 was not a reliable indicator of its fair market value. According to Professor Dow, Cheil, SC&T and SEC were all traded in efficient markets at all relevant times. Professor Dow criticized the SOTP analysis performed by Dr. Duarte-Silva for failing to apply a holding company discount. Professor Dow opined that even if the Merger had been rejected, SC&T would have continued to trade at a discount.1676\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 23-26; Second ER Dow [**RER-6**], \u00b6\u00b6 9-46.\n\n1033.\n\nRespondent's second expert Professor Bae opined that the discrepancy between SC&T's share price and SOTP value was due to its holdings in listed affiliates and corporate governance concerns, both of which would not have disappeared if the Merger had been rejected. He disagreed with Dr. Duarte-Silva's assumption that the discount was due to the threatened value transfer of the Merger and with Professor Wolfenzon's opinion that no holding company discount is applicable to SC&T.1677\n\nER Bae [**RER-7**], \u00b6\u00b6 13-23.\n\n1034.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that both share price and SOTP analyses are appropriate methods for valuing companies such as SC&T. It is also common practice to validate the result of one valuation method with another. Consequently, the Tribunal will consider both methodologies in its further analysis.\n\n1035.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is doubtful as to whether the SOTP value of SC&T was indeed 70% higher than its market capitalization on the day before the Merger was approved, the Tribunal assumes for its further analysis that SC&T was indeed trading at a discount to its SOTP value.\n\n1036.\n\nIt is undisputed that any such discount was not caused by Respondent's breach of the FTA. Dr. Duarte-Silva's own calculation shows that the discount existed long before the Merger Announcement and even the Cheil IPO.1678\n\nSecond ER Duarte-Silva [**CER**-6], Figure 4; SC&T and Cheil's premiums [**CRA-196**].\n\n1037.\n\nClaimants' damages calculation rests on the assumption that in the counterfactual scenario, in which the Merger would have been rejected with the votes of the NPS, the entire discount would have disappeared and the SOTP value would have been unlocked. According to Claimants, \"[h]ad the NPS voted against the merger \u2026, the stock market's discount to the intrinsic value of Mason's shares in SC&T would not have been locked in, and Mason would have continued to hold its positions in SC&T and SEC in pursuance of its investment strategy\".1679\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 243.\n\n1038.\n\nDr. Duarte-Silva also confirmed in cross-examination at the Hearing that his damages calculation rests on this assumption:1680\n\nQ. And your position, sir, is that this entire discount would have disappeared had the Merger been rejected; right?\n\nA. Had the Merger been rejected, the threat of value transfer would be gone; and, therefore, the price would go up to its Sum Of The Parts, or its Intrinsic Value.\n\nQ. The entire discount would have disappeared; right?\n\nA. Yes, that's what I said.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 4, 24 March 2022, p. 622:6-15 [Cross-examination of Dr. Duarte-Silva].\n\n1039.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it has not been established with a reasonable degree of probability that but for Respondent's breach, the discount would have disappeared, and SC&T's share price would have risen to its SOTP value. This is for the following reasons.\n\n1040.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the discount at which SC&T was trading prior to the Merger vote can be attributed solely to the Merger and to any expectation on the part of market participants that the Merger would be approved or that value would be extracted from SC&T shareholders.\n\n1041.\n\nAs stated above, Dr. Duarte-Silva's own calculations show that the SC&T discount existed long before the Merger Announcement and even before the Cheil IPO on 18 December 2014. As stated above, there were media reports in September 2014 which predicted a merger between Cheil and SC&T.1681 However, the Tribunal considers it unlikely that market participants already anticipated the Merger in the first quarter of 2014. Yet Professor Bae's study of analysis reports published in the first quarter of 2014 shows that already then, analysts thought SC&T was trading at a discount to its target price, with the average discount rate of those analysts using SOTP valuations being 25%.1682 None of these analyst reports mentioned a potential merger between SC&T and Cheil.\n\nSee, e.g., \"Where is Samsung C&T heading? Lee Jae-yong's 'construction,'\" Business Watch, 5 September 2014 [**R-80**]; \"Samsung's 'restructuring business' train; when is the last stop?\" MoneyS, 16 September 2014 [**R-82**].\n\nER Bae [**RER-7**], \u00b6 110, Appendix Figure 10, Panel B.\n\n1042.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not convinced that the discount can be attributed to any price manipulation in the months prior to the Merger Announcement. As Professor Dow has shown, the instances of alleged price manipulation that Claimants have referred to could only have had a small impact on the share price.1683\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 133-138.\n\n1043.\n\nThere are many reasons why a stock may trade at a discount.1684 Other possible reasons for the discount on SC&T's SOTP value include a holding company discount, the complex structure of the Samsung Group, corporate governance issues (which would not have been resolved by the rejection of the Merger) and tax liabilities. Given that it is common (and a \"fact of life\") for Korean conglomerates to trade at a discount,1685 the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the discount is solely due to the risk that the Merger would be approved on terms unfavorable to SC&T shareholders and would extract value from them.\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 5, 25 March 2022, p. 873:1-10 [Cross-examination of Professor Wolfenzon].\n\nFirst ER Report [**RER-4**] \u00b6\u00b6 190-193, 211-213; Second ER Dow [**RER-6**], \u00b6\u00b6 14, 26-31, 135, 150-155; ER Bae [**RER-7**], \u00b6\u00b6 112-118; Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 4, 24 March 2022, p. 691:11-692:22 [Presentation of Professor Dow].\n\n1044.\n\nEven among Claimants' witnesses and experts, there are different opinions on the reasons for the undervaluation of SC&T. Whereas Dr. Duarte-Silva opined that the discount was due to the threat of value transfer,1686 Mr. Garschina believed that SC&T and SEC were undervalued due to poor corporate governance in the Samsung Group.1687\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 4, 24 March 2022, p. 622:6-15 [Cross-examination of Dr. Duarte-Silva]; First ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6 46.\n\nThird witness statement of Kenneth Garschina, 9 June 2020 [**CWS-5**], \u00b6 17; Fourth witness statement of Kenneth Garschina, 21 April 2021 [**CWS-7**], \u00b6\u00b6 8-10; Transcript of Hearing on Merits, Day 2, 22 March 2022, p. 331:2-24 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].\n\n1045.\n\nFurthermore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that in the counterfactual scenario, the discount would have disappeared, and SC&T's share price would have risen to its SOTP value.\n\n1046.\n\n*First,* if the Merger was indeed \"the litmus test for whether meaningful change was truly underway in Korea\", as suggested by Mr. Garschina,1688 then the rejection of the Merger alone would likely have been insufficient to unlock the intrinsic value of SC&T.\n\nFourth witness statement of Kenneth Garschina, 21 April 2021 [**CWS-7**], \u00b6 9.\n\n1047.\n\n*Second,* the fact that the merged company continued to trade at a discount after the Merger, as shown by Professor Bae's study of multiple analyst reports, confirms that the rejection of the Merger would likely not have resulted in the elimination of any discount. As Professor Bae explained, if SC&T's discount and Cheil's premium before the Merger were entirely due to the expected value transfer, the newly merged entity should trade at neither a discount nor a premium. However, the analyst reports published between October and December 2015 which Professor Bae examined continued to show a significant discount to the analysts' SOTP valuations, with the average discount being 30%.1689\n\nER Bae [**RER-7**], \u00b6\u00b6 106-108, Appendix H Figure 10, Panel A.\n\n1048.\n\nThe persistence of a discount in merged entities has also been observed among other *chaebols*.1690\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**] \u00b6\u00b6 190-193, 211-213; Second ER Dow [**RER-6**], \u00b6\u00b6 150-155.\n\n1049.\n\n*Third*, the fact the SC&T share price decreased following the Merger vote does not indicate either that the share price would have risen to the SOTP value in case of the rejection of the Merger. In fact, the initial reaction of the stock market to the Merger Announcement, which included the unfavorable Merger Ratio, was positive.1691\n\nBloomberg stock prices of SEC and SC&T [**DOW-WP1**], tab \"Stock Prices\".\n\n1050.\n\nEven if one accepts that the SC&T share price would have likely increased in the \"but for\" scenario, there is no reliable basis for making any predictions about the price it would have reached. In the Tribunal's view, analysts' opinions about the trajectory of the share price in the counterfactual scenarios, including those of NPS employees,1692 are not a reliable basis for quantifying losses. The Tribunal considers that it would be purely speculative to assume a certain rate of share price appreciation in the counterfactual scenario.\n\nTranscript of Court Testimony of [REDACTED] Case 2017Gohap34/2017Gohap183 (Seoul Central District Court, 8 May 2017) [**C-174**], pp. 15-16.\n\n1051.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is not convinced that the hypothetical fair market value of Claimants' SC&T shares \"but for\" Respondent's breach of the Treaty is the SOTP value calculated by Dr. Duarte-Silva. Consequently, the Tribunal decides that Claimants' primary claim based on a SOTP valuation of their SC&T shares is not well-founded.\n\n**b)** ***Claimants' alternative claim for trading losses***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1052.\n\nIn the Amended Statement of Claim, Claimants put forth an alternative claim for trading losses in the amount of USD 47.2 million.1693 Dr. Duarte-Silva calculated these trading losses by subtracting the amounts received by Claimants upon selling their shares in SC&T from the total price paid by Claimants for those shares.1694 By letter of 10 October 2023, the Tribunal invited the Parties' comments on an alternative method of calculating Claimants' losses by reference to the share price on the day before the Merger Vote and Claimants' sales proceeds.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 253.\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 86-89.\n\n1053.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this methodology more accurately determines the losses caused by Respondent's breach. In light of the Tribunal's above findings that any discount on the SOTP value was neither caused by the threat of value extraction by the Merger nor would likely disappear following the rejection of the Merger, the share price on 16 July 2015 is the more accurate measure of the fair market value of SC&T prior to the Merger vote.\n\n1054.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the prices actually paid by Claimants for their SC&T shares to be a less accurate indicator of SC&T's fair market value prior to the Merger vote. Claimants started buying SC&T shares in mid-April 2015 and bought larger quantities in early June 2015, with the last buy order placed on 9 June 2015.1695 During this time span, Claimants paid more for their SC&T shares than the shares were worth on 16 July 2015. These share price fluctuations were not caused by Respondent's wrongful conduct and therefore do not form part of Claimants' recoverable losses.\n\nMason trading records (SC&T) [**C-32**]; see also Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\n1055.\n\nThe share price on 16 July 2015 reflected the market's expectations as to the likelihood of the Merger being approved or rejected on a level playing field without undue influence on the NPS' exercise of voting rights. There is no evidence that Respondent's undue interference with the NPS' decision-making was already known at that time. While the results of the Investment Committee meeting on 10 July 2015 were leaked to the press on the same day,1696 these reports did not mention any corrupt influence peddling of the Korean government. The fact that the SC&T share price increased between 10 and 16 July 20151697 can serve as an indication that the market was neither aware of nor anticipated such wrongful conduct.\n\n[REDACTED], Pension fund decides on Samsung merger, KOREA HERALD, 10 July 2015 [**C-85**]; [REDACTED], NPS decides on Samsung Merger, KOREA TIMES, 10 July 2015 [**C-86**]; see also Rejoinder, \u00b6 160 b).\n\nBloomberg stock prices of SEC and SC&T [**DOW-WP1**], tab \"Stock Prices\".\n\n1056.\n\nIn the absence of any reliable, evidence-based projections on how the share price would have developed if the Merger had been rejected, the Tribunal considers that the share price on 16 July 2015 is the best available estimate of SC&T's fair market value in the counterfactual scenario. While the Tribunal is aware that some commentators predicted an increase of SC&T's share price in the event of a rejection of the Merger, the Tribunal is not in a position to quantify such hypothetical gains. As noted above, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the share price would have increased to the level of any SOTP valuation, and it would be pure speculation for the Tribunal to assume any lower rate of share price appreciation.\n\n1057.\n\nAccording to Claimants' broker, Goldman Sachs, Claimants held 3,046,915 shares in SC&T as of 17 July 2015.1698 Pursuant to Claimants' trading records, they held 3,047,115 shares in SC&T as of 16 July 2015 but did not make trades on either 16 or 17 July 2015.1699 According to Dr. Duarte-Silva's first expert report, the number of SC&T shares held by Claimants on 17 July 2015 was 3,047,120.1700 There are small discrepancies between these numbers which are not attributable to any trades on 16 or 17 July 2015.\n\nGoldman Sachs Brokerage Letter, 10 September 2018 [**C-29**].\n\nMason trading records (SC&T) [**C-32**].\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], fn. 11. The discrepancy of 205 shares is likely due to Dr. Duarte-Silva's consideration of additional shares in other Samsung securities which are possibly global depository receipts; cf. Goldman Sachs' brokerage letters [**CRA-170**]. The number of 3,047,120 shares was also used by Professor Dow in his first expert report, cf. [**DOW-WP1**], tab \"Table 1\".\n\n1058.\n\nBy email dated 30 November 2023, Claimants confirmed that the Tribunal's calculation in its letter of 10 October 2023, which was based on the amount of 3,046,915 shares held by Claimants on 16 July 2015, is correct. The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis that Claimants held 3,046,915 SC&T shares on 16 July 2015, which is the lowest number of shares suggested by Claimants and which is confirmed by Goldman Sachs' brokerage letter.1701 The Tribunal also referred to this number of shares in its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections.1702\n\nGoldman Sachs Brokerage Letter, 10 September 2018 [**C-29**].\n\nDecision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 55.\n\n1059.\n\nThe share price of SC&T on 16 July 2015 was KRW 69,300.1703 Consequently, the market value of Claimants' shareholding in SC&T on 16 July 2015 was KRW 211,151,209,500.00.\n\nBloomberg stock prices of SEC and SC&T [**DOW-WP1**], tab \"Stock Prices\".\n\n1060.\n\nBy close of trading on 17 July 2015, SC&T's share price declined by 10.4% to KRW 62,100.1704 According to Professor Dow, this decline, to a large extent, cannot be explained by general market conditions.1705 Rather, it is attributable to the market's reaction to the Merger approval.\n\nBloomberg stock prices of SEC and SC&T [**DOW-WP1**], tab \"Stock Prices\".\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 120-122, Figure 16.\n\n1061.\n\nClaimants sold their SC&T shares in different tranches between 24 July 2015 and 12 August 2015.1706 On 24 July 2015, the share price of SC&T was KRW 58,000. On 12 August 2015, it was KRW 49,700.1707 Claimants' proceeds from the sale of 3,046,915 SC&T shares amount to KRW 173,513,968,295.27.1708 Therefore, the difference between the value of Claimants' SC&T shares on 16 July 2015 and its sales proceeds is KRW 37,637,241,204.73.\n\nMason trading records (SC&T) [**C-32**].\n\nBloomberg stock prices of SEC and SC&T [**DOW-WP1**], tab \"Stock Prices\".\n\nMason trading records (SC&T) [**C-32**].\n\n1062.\n\nAlthough the share prices at which Claimants sold were lower than SC&T's share price by close of trading on 17 July 2015, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to use Claimants' actual sales proceeds for determining the fair market value of their SC&T shares in the actual scenario. This is for several reasons. *First*, the Tribunal considers it sufficiently likely that the further decline of SC&T's share price in the following days is also attributable to the Merger approval. *Second*, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimants could not be expected to sell their entire shareholding on the eve of the Merger vote. Such a decision to liquidate the entire shareholding and effectively give up the investment needs to be considered and prepared. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for large share positions to be sold in different tranches and on different days. Claimants sold their position within 14 working days which the Tribunal does not consider to be an unreasonable amount of time.\n\n1063.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that as a result of Respondent's breach of the FTA, Claimants have suffered losses in respect of their SC&T shares in the amount of KRW 37,637,241,204.73.\n\n**D.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n**a)** ***Claimants' \"price target\" claim***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1069.\n\nAt the outset, Respondent asserts that Claimants' claim with respect to their investments in SEC hinges on their own reaction to the outcome of the Merger vote, i.e., their decision to liquidate SEC shares in summer of 2015 when Korea's alleged actions were not even known.1721 Accordingly, in Respondent's view, Claimants' own decision to sell the shares, under no compulsion of Korea, breaks any causation of law and end the analysis of the claim.1722\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, 21 March 2022, p. 240:7-11 [Respondent's Opening Submission].\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, 21 March 2022, pp. 240:24-241:4 [Respondent's Opening Submission].\n\n1070.\n\nAddressing the substance of Claimants' claim, Respondent notes that Claimants arrive at their figure of USD 44.2 million for their SEC share claim by first establishing \"the hypothetical proceeds Mason would have earned had it not sold its SEC shares until they reached Mason's 'price target.'\"1723 According to Respondent, this \"target price\" for the SEC shares is derived from Claimants' subjective assessment of SEC's \"intrinsic value\".1724 Respondent contends that following Claimants' analysis, the market price of SEC shares would appreciate until SEC's market capitalization met the \"intrinsic value\", which Respondent contends would have occurred almost a year and a half after Claimants sold their shares in SEC.1725 According to Respondent, the fact that the value of the SEC shares ultimately met Claimants' price target approximately 16 months after the alleged treaty breach \"does not offer any *post-facto* objective validation of Mason's claimed loss\" as the \"alleged loss remains the fruit of a subjective and speculative valuation exercise\".1726\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 532.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 535, First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 68, 72.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 535, referring to First ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 99-100; First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 199-202.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 539.\n\n1071.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants chose to not to apply the same methodology to calculate Mason's purported losses with respect to SEC as they did with respect to SC&T because there is no evidence that the fair market value of SEC at the time of the Merger was other than its market price.1727\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 110, 111-113-114. See also Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, 21 March 2022, p. 241:15-21 [Respondent's Opening Submission].\n\n1072.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimants' intrinsic value analysis contains \"unsupported assumptions and inconsistencies\" and that Claimants are required instead to conduct an \"event study\".1728 Respondent argues that there are many reasons why the market price of a share may not reflect an investor's \"price target\", and that the uncertainty of using this approach is reinforced by \"the range of 'price targets' issued by securities analysts for SEC at the time\".1729 Relying on Professor Dow's opinion, Respondent contends that Claimants' model for SEC \"unjustifiably overstates the 'intrinsic value' of SEC\" by (i) applying a forward-looking price-to-earnings multiple to value SEC's core operations instead of a standard valuation multiple, and (ii) employing \"inconsistent approaches to selecting comparable companies against which to value SEC's various business segments\" while failing to take into account \"the well-established Korean discount to account for Korean geopolitical risks and the Korean business environment.1730 Respondent also rejects Claimants' reliance on the extent to which Claimants' price target for SEC departs from other analysts' price targets because this has no effect on the material errors causing the overstatement of SEC's intrinsic value.1731\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 536; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 109-112.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 536; Rejoinder, \u00b6 647.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 537, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 175-177, 232(b), 233; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 110.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 649.\n\n1073.\n\nRespondent argues that Mason's own investment thesis for SEC \"demonstrates the uncertainty of assumptions underpinning its assessment of SEC's intrinsic value\", as it relied on the enactment of new laws, further regulation between non-financial and financial affiliates, and even a change in the Korean government, with \"[e]ach of these events carry[ing] with them significant uncertainty as to their realization\".1732 Respondent contends that Claimants provide no rationale for their assertion that the rejection of the Merger would have accelerated regulatory changes and stimulated governance changes in the Samsung Group, increasing SEC's intrinsic value in the process.1733 According to Respondent, Claimants' position in this regard is belied by the fact that the rejection of the proposed Merger between two Samsung Group affiliates in November 2014 \"resulted in significant losses to shareholder value in both companies, as well as in multiple Samsung Group affiliates\".1734\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 538 referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6 81.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 539.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 538, *referring to First ER* Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 185-88, Table 6.\n\n1074.\n\nRespondent also disputes Claimants' argument that the reasonableness of Claimants' price target is irrelevant to the extent that what matters is that Claimants would have sold their shares at the price target but for the breaches.1735 Respondent asserts that the reasonableness of Claimants' SEC model \"is the only objective touchpoint for Mason's SEC Share Claim\" as Claimants could pick any price target and claim that they abandoned their \"hoped-for profits\" as a result of Korea's actions.1736 Moreover, Respondent contends that the fact that Claimants' price target for SEC was eventually met does not validate Claimants' estimation of SEC's intrinsic value 17 months prior.1737 Respondent asserts that it was highly uncertain that Mason could have held onto its SEC shares if it had initially intended to and that the notion that Mason intended to keep its SEC shares until they reached the price target is based solely and unreasonably on Mr. Garshina's statement, over which Respondent raises doubts.1738\n\nSee Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, 11 May 2022, pp. 1058:13-1060:19 [Respondent's Closing Submission].\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 650.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 651; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 145-148.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 146-147, referring to Transcript of Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, 22 March 2022, 346:13-21 [Cross-examination of Mr. Garschina].

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1080.\n\nIrrespective of its decision that Respondent's breach of the Treaty did not legally cause Claimants' losses with respect to their SEC shares, the Tribunal considers that Claimants have not established the existence and extent of any losses in respect of their SEC shares with a reasonable degree of probability.\n\n1081.\n\nAs regards Claimants' primary claim for the difference between Claimants' target price for their SEC shares and their actual sales proceeds, the Tribunal considers Claimants' price target model not to be supported by convincing evidence or expert testimony. Notably, neither of Claimants' experts has performed any independent valuation of SEC shares, such as a SOTP analysis, which could have served as an objective verification of Claimants' subjective assumptions regarding the intrinsic value of SEC.1750\n\nFirst ER Duarte-Silva [**CER-4**], \u00b6 93 (\"I have not performed a valuation of SEC's shares, as that would be extraneous to an assessment of when Mason would have sold its shares of SEC. Nor do I provide an opinion on Mason's investment strategy. My opinion \u2026 only relates to the potential sales proceeds that Mason could have realized in the event it had proceeded under its stated investment strategy and the implied damages compared to the actual sales proceeds\".).\n\n1082.\n\nFurthermore, there is no reliable evidence on how the SEC share price would have developed but for Respondent's breach. Claimants' experts have not conducted any event study on the impact of the Merger on the SEC share price. The mere fact that the SEC share price ultimately reached Claimants' price target approx. 16 months1751 after the alleged breach does not suffice to validate Claimants' investment thesis *post facto.*\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**], Figure 18.\n\n1083.\n\nClaimants' alternative claim for the difference between the value of their SEC shares on 16 July 2015 and their actual sales proceeds was first raised in Claimants' Comments on Quantum on 21 November 2023. In the Tribunal's view, this alternative claim is too late and must therefore be precluded. By letter of 10 October 2023, the Tribunal only sought the Parties' comments on the alternative method of calculating Claimants' losses in respect of their SC&T shares. The Tribunal did not invite the Parties' submissions on any other issues, including on any alternative methodology for calculating losses in respect of the SEC shares. As the Parties filed their submissions simultaneously, Respondent did not have the opportunity to respond to this alternative claim.\n\n1084.\n\nEven if the alternative claim were to be permitted, it would not be well-founded as Claimants have not established that the Merger approval negatively affected the SEC share price and were not attributable to general market conditions. To the contrary, Professor Dow opined that the SEC share price from 1 July 2014 until the Merger close date showed no discernible impact of the Merger.1752\n\nFirst ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6 196(b), Figure 9.\n\n1085.\n\nConsequently, in addition to the lack of legal causation, Claimant have not established the existence of any losses with respect to their SEC shares.\n\n**E. General Partner's loss in its Incentive Allocation**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n1086.\n\nFurther or alternatively, Claimants submit that Respondent's actions resulted in a loss to the General Partner \"by reducing the incentive allocation to which it would have been entitled had Respondent not breached the FTA\".1753 This is because, according to Claimants, a loss sustained in one fiscal year could have a continuing impact on the calculation of the Incentive Allocation for subsequent fiscal years under the Incentive Allocation formula provided in Article 4.06(b) of the Partnership Agreement.1754\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 257.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 259, referring to Mason Capital Master Fund, L.P., Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, 30 January 2013 [**C-30**], Art. 4.06(b).\n\n1087.\n\nFollowing Respondent's criticisms relating to an errant additional addback in Mr. Satzinger's calculation of the General Partner's lost Incentive Allocation, Claimants submit that the corrected figure is USD 917,156, rather than USD 1.1 million.1755 Other than eliminating the inadvertent inclusion of extra profit, Claimants maintain that no further change is necessary.1756 In this respect, Claimants highlight Dr. Duarte-Silva's criticism of Professor Dow's proposed correction, noting that the approach \"bring[s] in facts to support mutually inconsistent positions\" and that there is \"no feasible scenario \u2013 actual or hypothetical \u2013 in which [Prof. Dow's purported] allocation of profits can occur\".1757\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 259; Reply, \u00b6 363.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1088.\n\nAccording to Respondent, if the FTA allows the General Partner to claim the Limited Partner's losses as its own, Claimants' Incentive Allocation claim would be \"duplicative and unrecoverable\" as a matter of law, as it would allow the General Partner to \"claim the Cayman Fund's alleged losses under Mason's SC&T and SEC Share claims and then separately claim a portion of those losses again as a lost entitlement\".1758 Therefore, if the Tribunal grants Claimants' damages claims with respect SC&T and SEC shares, Respondent takes the view that the General Partner would, through those amounts, already receive any fee that would be payable to it as an incentive allocation under the Partnership Agreement.1759\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 546; Rejoinder, \u00b6 654(a).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 654(a).\n\n1089.\n\nHowever, if the FTA does not allow the General Partner to claim the Limited Partner's losses at its own, Respondent reiterates that Claimants' Incentive Allocation claim, i.e., the General Partner's beneficial interest in the Cayman Fund's investments, would be the upper limit of the General Partner's recovery.1760\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 547; Rejoinder, \u00b6 654(b).\n\n1090.\n\nAs observed by Professor Dow, Respondent argues that the General Partner's Incentive Allocation claim is overstated due to two technical errors, including \"a series of unfounded 'addbacks' to the Limited Partner's capital account [calculated by Mr. Satzinger], which unduly increase the Cayman Fund's cumulative profits\".1761 Respondent further notes that Claimants' calculation \"does not account for the fact that the General Partner's incentive allocation as, in part, determined as a function of the number of the Cayman Fund's investors, that number was dynamic, and it diminished through 2015\".1762\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 549, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 257-260.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 656.\n\n1091.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the General Partner's Incentive Allocation claim, after accounting for these errors, should be no more than USD 421,966.1763\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 549, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6 260, Table 13; Rejoinder, \u00b6 656.\n\n**3. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1092.\n\nHaving found that the General Partner is entitled to the entire losses in respect of the Samsung Shares which it legally owns, the Tribunal considers that the General Partner cannot separately claim the lost Incentive Allocation as this would amount to a double recovery.\n\n**F. Claimants' duty to mitigate**\n----------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n1093.\n\nRelying on the Commentary on the ILC Articles, Claimants submit that \"the duty to mitigate requires no more than the victim of a wrongful act acting 'reasonably when confronted by the injury'\" and therefore that Respondent's arguments concerning mitigation are misconceived.1764 Rather, Claimants argue that interpreting the duty to mitigate as requiring the injured party to expose itself to further risk by making new investments in the territory of the violating state is not at all reasonable and accordingly not required under international law.1765\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 365-366, citing Commentary on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Article 31, cmt. 11; *see also* *Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d. v.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1096.\n\nRespondent submits that international law precludes an injured party from recovering losses to the extent that it has failed in its duty to mitigate those losses.1771 Particularly, Respondent cites the tribunal in *Clayton v. Canada*, which noted that \"[t]he duty to mitigate applies if: (i) a claimant is unreasonably inactive following a breach of treaty; or (ii) a claimant engages in unreasonable conduct following a breach of treaty\".1772 Respondent asserts that this principle is firmly established in international law and allows investment tribunals to reduce damages where a claimant waives opportunities to mitigate losses.1773\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 550.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 659, *Clayton et al. v. Canada* [**RLA-174**], \u00b6 204.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 550, *relying on* *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 11 June 2012 [**RLA-133**], \u00b6\u00b6 1302-1312.\n\n1097.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants' conduct satisfies this requirement and that Claimants' theory of damages with respect to their claimed losses in SC&T and SEC shares fails to account for opportunities that Claimants had to mitigate such losses.1774 For instance, concerning Claimants' SC&T shares, Respondent contends that Claimants could have mitigated their losses by investing the proceeds that they received from the sale of their SC&T shares \"in a number of other Korean companies experiencing the same discount to their 'intrinsic value' that Mason claims animated its investments in the Samsung Group\".1775 With respect to Claimants' SEC shares, Respondent contends that Claimants could have mitigated their losses by simply not selling their shares until at least January 2017, when the SEC share price surpassed Claimants' \"price target\" or by using the proceeds from liquidating their SEC position for other profitable investments.1776\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 551; Rejoinder, \u00b6 660.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 551, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6\u00b6 263-64.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 551, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6 262; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 149-150.\n\n**3. U.S. submission**\n----------------------\n\n1098.\n\nThe United States submits that there exists in international law a well-established principle that a claimant has the obligation to undertake reasonable mitigation measures, which is relevant to the calculation of damages.1777 The United States contends that a claimant has an obligation to impose both positive and negative steps to \"minimize loss that that would otherwise flow from the respondent's breach, and refrain from taking steps that may unjustifiably increase its losses\".1778\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 39.\n\nU.S. Submission, \u00b6 39, relying on G.H. Treitel, *Remedies for Breach of Contract*, *in* 7 INT'L ENCYC. COMP. LAW 75, 76 (1976).\n\n**4. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1099.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Claimants have not established recoverable damages with respect to their SEC shares. Consequently, the Tribunal will limit its analysis of Claimants' duty of mitigation to their damages regarding the SC&T shares.\n\n1100.\n\nAs regards those shares, the Tribunal is not convinced that Claimants remained unreasonably inactive or engaged in unreasonable conduct following the Treaty breach. As noted before, the Tribunal considered the time span during which Claimants sold their SC&T shares reasonable.\n\n1101.\n\nNeither could Claimants have been expected to mitigate their losses by re-investing the proceeds in other Korean companies which traded at a discount. Claimants incurred their losses when they sold their SC&T shares. This process was completed by 12 August 2015. At that point, the damage was done. The duty to mitigate does not require an investor to make investments to offset losses already incurred and caused by the State.\n\n1102.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Respondent has not established that Claimants violated their duty to mitigate their losses.\n\n**G. Currency**\n---------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n1103.\n\nRelying on the tribunal in *Siemens v. Argentina*, Claimants submit that they are entitled to compensation in U.S. Dollars because being compensated in Korean Won would expose Claimants to the risk of currency depreciation up to the payment of the award and would cause Claimants to receive less than the full reparation because of this risk.1779\n\nReply, \u00b6 375, relying on *Siemens AG v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award, February 6, 2007 [**RLA-104]**, \u00b6 361.\n\n**2. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1104.\n\nRespondent contests Claimants' request for an award in U.S. Dollars, asserting that there is no justification for this request and that Claimants are merely seeking to be put in a superior position than they would otherwise have been in in the \"but for\" scenario.1780 Respondent submits that Claimants were already exposed to the currency exchange risk when they decided to invest in Korea and that such risk existed regardless of the alleged treaty-breaching conduct.1781\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 557.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 671.\n\n1105.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the only appropriate currency in which to award damages is Korean Won, given that \"Mason invested in a South Korean company by buying shares on the South Korean exchange and paying for them in South Korean won, then received Korean won when it sold those shares\".1782\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 556, referring to First ER Dow [**RER-4**], \u00b6 260; Rejoinder, \u00b6 671.\n\n**3. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1106.\n\nOn the issue of the currency in which the award is to be made, the Tribunal considers the decision of the *Siemens v. Argentina* tribunal to be instructive and agrees with its conclusion.\n\n1107.\n\nIn that case, the investor had agreed to a contract denominated in the local currency and had no guarantee regarding currency exchange rate. Nonetheless, the tribunal ruled that the principle of full reparation would be violated \"if the parity of the currency would be added as yet another risk to be taken by the investor\" after the State breached its obligations under an investment treaty.1783\n\n*Siemens AG v The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award, 6 February 2007 [**RLA-104**], \u00b6 361.\n\n1108.\n\nWhile Claimants paid their shares in Korean Won and received Korean Won when they sold those shares, they did not assume the currency exchange risk between the date of Respondent's breach and the payment of the award. The Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to award Claimants damages in USD, based on the KWR-USD exchange rate as of the valuation date.\n\n1109.\n\nAs stated above, Claimants sold their last SC&T shares on 12 August 2015,1784 at which time the sale of Claimants' shareholding was completed and their losses became quantifiable. On that date, the USD-KRW exchange rate was 1:1175.03.1785 Using this historic exchange rate, Claimants' losses with respect to their SC&T shares amount to USD 32,030,876.83.\n\nMason trading records (SC&T) [**C-32**].\n\nKorean Foreign Exchange Rates [**C-33**].\n\n**H. Interest**\n---------------\n\n**1. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n1110.\n\nClaimants submit that in order to be made whole, the Tribunal should award Mason pre- and post-award compound interest at a minimum rate of 5% per annum.1786 Claimants contend that an award of interest is consistent with the principle of full reparations as it provides a remedy to an investor that has lost the opportunity to invest funds to which it was rightfully entitled.1787 Claimants assert that interest must be awarded from the date of Claimants' losses to their investments in SC&T and SEC in order to compensate Claimants for the lost opportunity to invest the amounts due.1788\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 260.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 261; Claimants' PHB, \u00b6 198.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 262.\n\n1111.\n\nClaimants note that while the FTA does not specify a rate of interest payable on compensation due for treaty breaches, they contend that an interest rate of 5% per annum is commercially reasonable and in line with the standard Korean commercial judgment rate.1789 Claimants submit that other tribunals have considered it reasonable to award interest at the commercial judgment rate of host states, including an adjustment for inflation where appropriate.1790 Moreover, Claimants claim that this commercial judgment rate is even below the rate selected by other tribunals in international investment disputes.1791 Claimants argue that \"[s]uch interest must run until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled\".1792\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 263, referring to Korean Civil Act [**CLA-53**], Art.379; Claimants' PHB, \u00b6 197.\n\nReply, \u00b6 372, relying on *Southern Pacific Properties v Egypt*, Award of May, 20 1992 [**CLA-185]**, \u00b6\u00b6 223, 237; *Amco Asia Corp v Indonesia (Amco I),* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Award, November 20, 1984 [**CLA-170]**, \u00b6 281; *CME v Czech Republic*, Final Award on Damages, March 14, 2003 [**CLA-172]**, \u00b6 631.\n\nReply, \u00b6 373, relying on *UP and C.D Holding Internationale v.

Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Final Award, December 11, 2013 [**RLA-47],** \u00b6\u00b6 1271-1272.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 264.\n\n1112.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants contend that they should be awarded interest on a monthly1793 compound basis, which Claimants argue would be consistent with the reasoning of numerous tribunals that have found \"that compound interest best gives effect to the customary international law standard of full reparations\".1794 Claimants also contend that awarding compound interest would represent a \"recognition of the fact that the injured party has been deprived of the opportunity to lend or invest the principle amount of compensation at compound interest rates\".1795\n\nReply, \u00b6 374.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 266, referring to *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/11, Award, 5 October 2012 [**CLA-11**], \u00b6 312.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 265.\n\n1113.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants submit that they should be awarded compound interest at a minimum rate of 5% per annum, running from 17 July 2015 to the due date of this Award, and interest on the same basis from the date of this Award until final satisfaction of this Award.1796\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 267.\n\n1114.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's argument that Mason is not entitled to an award net of taxes and that Claimants would have had to pay taxes on any profits on its investments made in Korea.1797 Claimants further rejects Respondent's argument that Mason was required to provide evidence for its request, claiming that this is an attempt by Respondent to shift its own burden onto Claimants.1798\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 199.\n\nClaimants' PHB, \u00b6 199.\n\n1115.\n\nIn view of the above, Claimants submit that interest due on the principle compensation claimed by Claimants, calculated at a rate of 5% per annum as of the date of Dr. Durate-Silva's Expert Report (12 June 2020) amounts to the following:1799\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Damages** | **Value** | **Interest** | **Value with interest** |\n| Mason's loss with respect to its investment in SC&T | USD 147.2 million | USD 40.0 million | USD 187.2 million |\n| Mason's loss with respect to its investment in SEC | USD 44.2 million | USD 8.0 million | USD 52.2 million |\n| General Partner's lost incentive allocation | USD 1.1 million | USD 0.1 million | USD 1.2 million |\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 268.\n\n**2. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n1116.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' claim for interest is \"overstated due to its unjustifiably high interest rate\".1800 Respondent contends that there is no basis for applying the Korean court interest rate to an international arbitration proceeding, and argues that awarding Claimants pre-award interest of 5% per annum compounded monthly would be contrary to principles of international law to the extent that it would provide a \"windfall\" to Claimants.1801 Respondent contests Claimants' assertion that an interest rate of 5% is commercially reasonable, arguing instead that the appropriate interest rate is the Korean borrowing rate given that \"there is no risk associated with the time value of Mason's damages\".1802 Respondent claims that Dr. Duarte-Silva has undermined Claimants' position when he stated that the Mason Fund at the time was performing at about \"2 or 3 percent a year\".1803 Accordingly, Respondent asserts that any interest awarded by the Tribunal should be at the 2015 Korean borrowing rate of 2.01%, which Respondent contends \"would result in an award that more accurately reflects 'full compensation' in this international dispute than the interest rate set by Korean law\".1804\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 554.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 554, referring to *Quiborax S.A. & Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1120.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that Claimants are entitled to both pre- and post-award compound interest from the date of Claimants' losses to their investments in SC&T until payment of this award.\n\n1121.\n\nThe FTA does not specify the rate of interest payable on monetary damages. The Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission, cited in the Commentary on the ILC Articles, suggests awarding interest \"from the date the loss occurred until the date of payment, at a rate sufficient to compensate successful claimants for the loss of use of the principal amount of the award\".1814 In the Tribunal's view, the appropriate rate of interest can therefore only be established based on the circumstances of the case.\n\nDecision 16 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission, cited in the Commentary on the ILC Articles [**CLA-166**], Article 38, cmt. 4.\n\n1122.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a risk-free interest would not be sufficient to fully compensate Claimants. While the Tribunal is not bound to apply the Korean commercial judgment rate, it can provide some guidance on what interest rate is considered reasonable in the host State.\n\n1123.\n\nTaking these circumstances into account, the Tribunal considers that an interest rate of 5% p.a., compounded yearly, is commercially reasonable and sufficient to compensate Claimants for the loss of use of their monetary damages.\n\n1124.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that it is not in a position to make any declaration about whether the award is subject to Korean taxes.\n\n**IX.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1131.\n\nArticle 11.26.2 of the FTA provides that a \"tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules\".\n\n1132.\n\nArticle 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n1133.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides in relevant part:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n1134.\n\nAccordingly, the \"costs of arbitration\" which the Tribunal shall fix in the final award pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules comprise both the arbitration costs in the strict sense (i.e., the arbitrators' fees and expenses, the PCA's fees and expenses and any other costs borne by the PCA, e.g., for hearings or translation) and the legal fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in relation to the conduct of the arbitration.\n\n1135.\n\nThe Parties have made advance payments on the arbitration costs in equal shares of EUR 1,260,000.00 each, amounting to EUR 2,520,000.00 in total.\n\n1136.\n\nThe arbitration costs actually incurred amount to EUR 2,520,000.00 in total. They are composed as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Fees and Expenses** | **Amount (in EUR)** |\n| Professor Klaus Sachs Fees | 1,037,600.00 |\n| Professor Klaus Sachs Expenses | 12,326.13 |\n| Professor Klaus Sachs VAT | 199,485.96 |\n| Dame Elizabeth Gloster Fees | 341,400.00 |\n| Dame Elizabeth Gloster Expenses | 12,855.51 |\n| Professor Pierre Mayer Fees | 341,100.00 |\n| Professor Pierre Mayer Expenses | 10,954.51 |\n| Tribunal Assistant Expenses | 10,906.37 |\n| Tribunal Assistant VAT | 2,072.19 |\n| PCA Registry Fees | 250,410.15 |\n| PCA Registry Expenses | 18,789.71 |\n| Court reporting, hearing facilities, catering, printing and supplies, courier expenses, bank costs, and other miscellaneous items | 282,099.47 |\n| **Total** | 2,520,000.00 |\n\n1137.\n\nThe Parties' legal fees and expenses are set out above. The Tribunal notes that the Parties agreed in their email of 2 August 2022 not to include any arguments in their costs submissions and not to make any reply submissions. The Tribunal therefore considers the application in Respondent's Updated Costs Submission to be delayed and precluded by the Parties' prior agreement.\n\n1138.\n\nOn its own motion, the Tribunal sees no reason to order Claimants to submit supporting evidence for their costs submissions as it has no doubt that Claimants have actually incurred the costs and expenses claimed. Furthermore, the Tribunal is of the view that the legal fees and expenses of both Parties are reasonable and proportionate to the complexity of the case and the sophisticated factual and legal issues it involved, bearing in mind that it was Claimants who largely bore the burden of proof and had to establish the facts on which their claim was based.\n\n1139.\n\nPursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the Tribunal may allocate the costs as it deems reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case. Under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal may apportion the legal fees and expenses between the Parties as it deems reasonable in light of the circumstances of the case.\n\n1140.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to distinguish between the different phases of the arbitration.\n\n1141.\n\nIn its Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal had reserved its decision on costs. Given that Claimants have fully prevailed in the preliminary objections phase and also with regard to the beneficial ownership issue (which the Tribunal had reserved), the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent bears the entire legal fees and expenses incurred by the Parties during the preliminary objections phase. Consequently, Respondent is obliged to reimburse Claimants' legal fees and expenses incurred during the preliminary objections phase in the amount of USD 2,456,802.07.\n\n1142.\n\nAs regards the main phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal notes that there were four jurisdictional issues, on three of which Claimants prevailed. On the merits, Claimants largely prevailed in terms of liability and causation, whereas they were only awarded approximately one sixth of the damages which they claimed. Nevertheless, there were also several quantum issues, notably the beneficial ownership issue, which were decided in Claimants' favor.\n\n1143.\n\nTaking these circumstances into account, the Tribunal considers it reasonable that Claimants bear 40% of their own legal fees and expenses incurred during the main phase of the proceedings (i.e., the amount of USD 5,241,439.81), whereas Respondent bears 60% of Claimants' legal fees and expenses for the main phase of the proceedings and all of its own legal fees and expenses. This means that Respondent is obliged to pay Claimants USD 7,862,159.71 in legal fees and expenses for the main phase of the proceedings.\n\n1144.\n\nIn total, Respondent thus has to reimburse Claimants USD 10,318,961.78 in legal fees and expenses.\n\n1145.\n\nBearing in mind that Claimants fully prevailed on Respondent's preliminary objections and largely on jurisdiction and merits, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Claimants bear 25% and Respondent bears 75% of the total arbitration costs. Given that the Parties advanced the arbitration costs in equal shares, Claimants are entitled to reimbursement of 50% of their share of the total arbitration costs, i.e., EUR 630,000.00.\n\n1146.\n\nPursuant to Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the PCA will render an accounting to the Parties of the deposits received.\n\n**X.
