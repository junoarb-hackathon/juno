His *curriculum vitae* and a declaration of impartiality and independence were circulated to the Parties.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, the Centre received an electronic copy of the Request for Arbitration dated 30 September 2021 (the \"RfA\" or the \"Request\"), accompanied with 26 factual exhibits (C-1 to C-26).\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 October 2021, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.\n\n11.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the presiding arbitrator by agreement of the two co-arbitrators, after consulting on the proposed presiding arbitrator with the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nOn 17 December 2021, following appointment by the Claimant, Mr. Stephen L. Drymer accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On the same day, following appointment by the Respondent, Prof. Philippe Sands KC accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nOn 31 January 2022, following appointment by the co-arbitrators pursuant to the Parties' agreement, Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler accepted her appointment as presiding arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nOn the same day, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n15.\n\nOn 1 February 2022, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 15(1)(c) and 15(2) (the \"Regulation\"), the ICSID Secretariat requested that each Party make an initial advance payment of USD 150,000 within 30 days.\n\n16.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat received payment from the Claimant on 8 March 2022 and on 10 March 2022 it received payment from the Respondent.\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 February 2022, the ICSID Secretariat, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, circulated a draft procedural order. The Parties provided their comments on the draft procedural order on 17 and 24 March 2022.\n\n18.\n\nOn 4 March 2022, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the disclosure of eight categories of information in relation to the Claimant's third-party funding arrangement with 24LF Capital. The request was accompanied with 4 legal authorities (RL-1 to RL-4).\n\n19.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, the Claimant provided information in relation to four requests formulated by the Respondent on 4 March, but objected to the remaining requests on the ground that they were irrelevant to the issue of security for costs and that the requested documents contain privileged information.\n\n20.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 25 March 2022 by videoconference. In addition to discussing the content of the draft procedural order, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed and agreed on transparency rules applicable to the present proceedings, including on the applicability of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration (\"Transparency Rules\") as adjusted to ICSID proceedings. It was agreed that the Tribunal would issue a separate order about the transparency regime governing the arbitration.\n\n21.\n\nOn 28 March 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\"), setting out the procedural rules governing this arbitration.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 March 2022, pursuant to the Tribunal's directions of 22 March 2023, the Respondent provided additional comments in relation to the Claimant's third-party funding arrangement with 24LF Capital and maintained its request for the disclosure of four categories of information. The letter was accompanied with 6 legal authorities (RL-5 to RL-10).\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 April 2022, the Claimant commented on the Respondent's letter of 29 March. The Claimant's letter was accompanied with 11 legal authorities (CL-1 to CL-11).\n\n24.\n\nOn 7 April 2022, the ICSID Secretariat, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, sent to the Parties a draft procedural order setting out the transparency rules governing this arbitration. The Parties provided their comments on the draft on 21 April 2022.\n\n25.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent further commented the Claimant's letter of 5 April. The Claimant responded to these further comments on 14 April 2022.\n\n26.\n\nOn 20 April 2022, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's application to obtain information on four categories of information on the grounds that their relevance to security for costs had not been sufficiently shown and, to the extent the application seeks to establish facts relevant to jurisdiction and quantum, it is premature.\n\n27.\n\nOn 22 April 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO2\"), setting out the transparency regime of this arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nOn 23 June and 22 July 2022, the Claimant informed the Respondent that it was negotiating with potential insurers to cover the risk of an adverse costs award.\n\n29.\n\nOn 19 August 2022, the Respondent filed a request for security for costs, accompanied with 12 factual exhibits (R-1 to R-12) and 12 legal authorities (RL-11 to RL-22).\n\n30.\n\nOn 30 September 2022, the Claimant filed its memorial (the \"Memorial\"), accompanied by 204 factual exhibits (C-27 to C-102, C-104 to C-126, C-128, C-130 to C-137, C-139 to C-148, and C-150 to C-236), 51 legal authorities (CL-12 through CL-62), the witness statements of Messrs.

The Claimant's Redfern Schedule was divided into 21 categories of documents and the Respondent's Redfern Schedule into 55 categories of documents, accompanied with 2 legal authorities (RL-110 to RL-111). The Claimant's introductory remarks to the Respondent's Redfern Schedule were accompanied with 7 factual exhibits (C-237 to C-243) and 6 legal authorities (CL-63 to CL-68).\n\n43.\n\nOn 19 May 2023, the Parties submitted their respective objections to the document production requests.\n\n44.\n\nOn 2 June 2023, the Parties produced non-objected documents and provided the Tribunal with their Redfern Schedules containing the outstanding document production requests.\n\n45.\n\nOn 9 June 2023, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal with regard to issues of privilege and jurisdiction arising out of the Respondent's requests for production of documents, and the Respondent commented on the Claimant's letter on 14 June 2023, accompanied with 5 legal authorities (RL-112 to RL-116).\n\n46.\n\nOn 20 June 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO3\") resolving the outstanding document production requests.\n\n47.\n\nOn 15 September 2023, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreement to extend the deadlines for the filing of the Claimant's reply memorial until 18 September 2023 and the Respondent's rejoinder memorial until 11 December 2023.\n\n48.\n\nOn 18 September 2023, the Claimant filed its reply memorial (the \"Reply\"), accompanied by 179 factual exhibits (C-244 to C-288, C-290 to C-319, C-321 to C-379, C-381 to C-416, and C-418 to C-426), 31 legal authorities (CL-70 to CL-100), the second witness statements of Messrs.

Article 44(3) specifies that \"[n]o one may endanger, or damage the environment, natural resources, and the cultural heritage beyond the extent laid down by law\".5 Under Article 44(4), the State must ensure \"a cautious use of natural resources, ecological balance, and effective environmental care\".6\n\nConstitution of the Slovak Republic, Article 4 (R-18).\n\nConstitution of the Slovak Republic, Article 44(3) (R-18).\n\nConstitution of the Slovak Republic, Article 44(4) (R-18).\n\n72.\n\nAccording to Article 4 of the Geology Act, only a holder of a geological authorization can perform geological works.7 The Ministry of Environment (\"MoE\") issues such authorization \"for an indefinite period of time\".8 In addition, geological works can only be carried out in an exploration area defined by the MoE, which issues an exploration area license.9 The validity periods of such licenses are governed by Article 24(8) of the Geology Act in the following terms:\n\n\"The exploration area shall be determined by the Ministry for the period required by the client and necessary for the performance of the geological works and for the area not exceeding the area justified by the most appropriate performance of the geological works from a technical and economic point of view. If the period specified is insufficient for the completion of the activities, it may, at the request of the exploration area holder, be extended by a period which is strictly necessary for the completion of the geological works. An extension of time must be requested at least three months before the expiry of the time limit. [\u2026]\".10\n\nGeology Act, Article 4(1)(a) (R-42).\n\nGeology Act, Article 6(3) (R-42).\n\nGeology Act, Articles 21(1) (R-42).\n\nGeology Act, Article 24(8) (R-42).\n\n73.\n\nArticle 29 of the Geology Act, which is entitled \"Entry onto and use of foreign property\", requires an exploration license holder to obtain the consent of the owner of the land to conduct geological works on \"foreign property\" (paragraph 3) or, in the absence of consent, an order from the MoE granting access (paragraphs 4-5). Article 29 reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"(1) For the purpose of carrying out geological works in the public interest, the contractor of geological works and persons authorised by him are entitled to enter foreign property, to establish on it workplaces, access roads and water and energy supply, carry out necessary land improvements and remove vegetation.\n\n(2) The activities referred to in paragraph 1 may be carried out only to the extent necessary, for the necessary period of time and for reasonable compensation.\n\n(3) The contractor of geological works is obliged to agree with the owner of the property the scope, method of carrying out and duration of the geological works and to notify the owner of the property of the commencement of the execution of the geological works in writing at least 15 days in advance.\n\n(4) If the owner of the property does not agree with the scope, manner and duration of the exercise of the authorization under paragraph 3 and no agreement is reached, the Ministry shall decide based on the application of the geological contractor of the geological works.\n\n(5) The foreign property may be used for the performance of geological works involving geological works or geological objects, by the geological contractor according to the agreement with the owner of the property. If no agreement is reached, the decision shall be taken on the contractor's proposal by the Ministry.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(9) The time limit for issuing a decision pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be six months from the date of submission of the application by the geological works contractor. If this time limit is insufficient for objective reasons, the Ministry shall be authorized to extend that period by an additional six months.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(12) Without the consent of the owner of the property and without a decision of the Ministry pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5, the contractor of geological works may restrict the ownership right only in urgent public interest, for the prevention or elimination of an imminent natural disaster and for the prevention of and the elimination of accidents pursuant to a special regulation, and only for the time strictly necessary\".11\n\nGeology Act, Article 29 (R-42).\n\n74.\n\nPursuant to Article 50(7) of the Forest Act, forest property owned by the Slovak Republic and managed by a state-owned entity may be leased to third parties, for instance to conduct geological works, provided the Ministry of Agriculture (\"MoA\") gives its \"prior consent\". That provision reads as follows:\n\n\"(7) The exchange, lease, lending and transfer of the management of forest property owned by the State shall require the prior consent of the Ministry, except for the transfer of the management of forest property owned by the State in the administration of a legal entity founded or established by the Ministry of Defence or established by the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic. Prior consent of the Ministry is not required for the lease of State-owned forest property with an area of less than 5000 m\u00b2 which is not directly connected to State-owned forest property of a similar nature. Leased State-owned forestry property may not be subleased unless otherwise agreed. The borrower may not leave forest property owned by the state for use by another entity. The consent of the Ministry shall also be required for an exemption affecting forest land pursuant to Article 3(1)(a) to (c) and (e) owned by the State, except for exemption in military forests and recreation areas established before the entry into force of this Act and for decision-making pursuant to Article 3(2)\".12\n\nForest Act, Article 50(7) (R-70).\n\n75.\n\nThe Parties agree that Slovak law provides for a permitting process to engage in oil and gas exploration that is structured as follows:13\n\n(a) Geological authorization: The interested party must apply for and obtain from the MoE a general authorization to perform geological works in accordance with Articles 4-6 of the Geology Act.14\n\n(b) Exploration area license: The interested party must apply for and obtain from the MoE a decision on the determination of the exploration area in accordance with Articles 22-24 of the Geology Act.15\n\n(c) Geological project design: Pursuant to Article 12 of the Geology Act, the exploration area license holder must commission a geological project design from an entity hired to perform geological works for the interested party that stipulates *inter alia* which geological works need to be carried out and sets out an approach towards their implementation.16 Pursuant to Article 25(8) of the Geology Act, the geological project design must be submitted to the MoE within three months of the determination of the exploration area and any later amendments within 30 days from the approval by the exploration area license holder.17 The technical part of the geological project design must be submitted to the relevant nature protection authority for its comments in accordance with Article 9(1)(n) of the Nature Protection Act.18\n\n(d) Right to explore land: The interested party must obtain the consent from all the land owners or apply for a decision from the MoE under Article 29 of the Geology Act.19\n\n(e) Notification of initiation to the Slovak Geological Institute: Pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Geology Act, the interested party must notify the Slovak Geological Institute of the commencement of exploration no later than on the day of such commencement.20\n\n(f) Notification of initiation to the District Mining Office: Pursuant to Article 13(4) of the Geology Act and Articles 2 and 5a of the Act on Mining Activities, the interested party must notify the District Mining Office of the commencement of exploration eight days prior to starting the activity.21\n\n(g) Preliminary EIA / Full EIA: Since 1 January 2017, pursuant to Article 29 and Annex 8 of the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (\"EIA Act\"), the interested party submits a \"project intent\" plan to the District Office, which then performs a preliminary EIA if drilling deeper than 600 meters is involved.

Exploration activities since 2014**\n----------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nOn 5 March 2014, Discovery Polska presented its initial review of the existing seismic data (i.e. the 2D data) and its \"new exploration concept\" to its future partners.113 This exploration concept contained two options: the first involved \"[w]orking in areas of old wells and shows, complimented by the old wells, field mapping, new seismic data, plus MT [Magneto Telluric studies]\"; the second \"[w]orking in new areas, based on new seismic data plus MT\".114 Regarding the MT studies, the presentation specified that MT had been used since the 1970s to explore areas that are \"inaccessible (cost prohibitive) to seismic acquisition\", but that it \"[l]acks the resolution of seismic data\".115 The exploration concept further envisaged \"[a]dditional geophysical activities\" and the drilling of \"two shallow test wells\" in 2014, followed by an \"[e]valuation of deep potential\" and the drilling of \"at least one deep test well\" in 2015, and, for 2016, either the extension of existing licenses, the application for new concessions or the application for production licenses.116 The presentation also contemplated the acquisition of additional geophysical studies, in particular MT \"and possible additional seismic [studies] on high-graded areas, time permitting\", the cost for the MT being estimated at USD 386,075.117 It further contained a priority ranking of shallow drilling locations, namely Vyxna Radvan, Shallow Smilno, Solnik and Mikova, with an estimated cost for a shallow well of USD 1,926,503, including a 25% contingency.118\n\nDiscovery-AOG presentation to JKX and Romgaz (Partners Presentation), 5 March 2014 (C-53).\n\nDiscovery-AOG presentation to JKX and

as well as its intention to seek an extension of the Exploration Licenses together with a partial relinquishment of the Snina Exploration License.120 Mr. Lewis presented the expenditures required for the MT studies, specifying that budget or surface constraints would likely mean that \"the number of points actually recorded would be less than the number of points in the submitted plan\".121 Mr. Lewis further explained that the estimated cost of the first two shallow wells would \"probably be less than the $1.8 million dollars US set forth in the budget\" (corresponding to EUR 1,309,140 per well), that he hoped to obtain the drilling permits \"within 90 to 180 days\" and that an authorization for expenditure (\"AFE\") would be submitted to the partners before starting to drill.122 The approved budget for the remainder of 2014 (Q2 to Q4) amounted to EUR 3,538,412 (EUR 1,769,206 for AOG and EUR 884,603 for each of the other partners), comprising EUR 308,872 for \"Tellurics Acquisition & Processing\" in Q2 (EUR 76,435 in Svidnik, EUR 203,208 in Medzilaborce and EUD 29,228 in Snina), EUR 43,638 for geological services allocated evenly from Q2 to Q4, and EUR 2,618,280 for

data and presenting the next exploration activities.126 In that presentation, it stated that in 2010 and 2011 Aurelian had identified \"[m]ultiple prospects and leads\",127 and that AOG was currently re-evaluating those leads and prospects and assessing the MT data it had acquired in the Ravdan area (including the Ravdan, O\u013eka, O\u013eka Stromy, Hrubov and Poruba \"Prospects\"), the Smilno area (including the \"Smilno Prospect\"), the Solnik area and the Mikova area.128 The presentation further specified that \"[w]ork is proceeding quickly to identify shallow projects (+/-1000m)\", further adding that \"only about 30% of the MT surveys acquired have been processed for these targets\".129\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014 (C-61).\n\nPartner's technical presentation, 11

intention to drill two wells (namely the O\u013eka and the Stromy Prospects) \"before the end of 2014\", i.e. in November and December, that \"the phase 1 acquisition of the MT surveys was completed\", that 30% of the interpretation of that data had been completed, and that the already processed data showed that \"certain prospects stood out that were very interesting\".130 Mr. Lewis added that \"he did not intend to use the MT surveys alone for purposes of selecting a drill site\", but that that data would be used \"to confirm what the 2D seismic, surface mapping and gravity data showed\".131 According to him, \"[t]he seismic data, the gravity data and the surface geology correlated nicely with the MT results\".132 He added that \"the biggest issue\" remaining \"related to reservoir quality\", which was the \"least quantified variable\", and that it would only be possible to \"know specifically what the porosity of the reservoir rock is until we actually drill the wells\".133\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-61).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-61).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 2 of the

looking for \"deeper targets\" and that the \"seismic was not sufficiently clear for such purposes\".134 He further expressed concern about the ability of the MT data to distinguish between water and hydrocarbons.\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-61).\n\n119.\n\nAfter summarizing the \"prospects\" he had identified, Mr. Lewis discussed the proposed schedule of activities, which included \"a 3D seismic survey over Radvan in Q1 and over Smilno in Q3 or Q4 of 2015\" \"to image the deeper prospects\", it being specified that \"acquiring the 3D seismic is better in winter\".135 Asked by Mr. [REDACTED] whether a 3D survey was still necessary if the MT worked sufficiently well, Mr. Lewis answered that \"even if the MT works as expected, we still need a 3D survey to identify the fault compartments\".136\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 4 of the pdf document (C-61).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 5 of the pdf document

minimum work commitment\", and further agreed that \"[a] decision on the 3D survey would be made later contingent on the results of the drilling activities\".137\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 5 of the pdf document (C-61).\n\n121.\n\nA third Operating Committee Meeting took place on 28 November 2014.138 Mr. Lewis started the meeting by stating that the AFE approval process had taken longer than anticipated, to which Mr. [REDACTED] from Romgaz answered that \"Romgaz needed a lower AFE number in order to obtain approval\", since the \"AFEs were higher than the approved budget\".139 Mr. [REDACTED] added that Romgaz needed \"a cost breakdown of the well\".140\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014 (C-66).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014, p. 1 (C-66).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014, p. 1 (C-66).\n\n122.\n\nMr. Fraser, AOG's new CFO, stated that AOG intended to drill two wells in the first quarter of 2015, two wells in the third quarter of 2015, and to conduct a \"3D seismic survey in the third quarter\".141 Mr. [REDACTED] from JKX suggested that AOG drill an additional well during 2015 and further suggested that AOG drill \"two firm wells in 2014 and one firm well in 2015 with two contingent wells in 2015\".142 He also asked whether a \"3D modelling program had been prepared\", adding that \"the 3D seismic survey should not be firm because there was more technical work that needed to be done\".143 Mr. Lewis answered that currently \"no in-depth modeling ha[d] been done\", that \"seismic data is very helpful to image faults and compartmentalize formations\", since MT \"really does not do this\", and that the scope of the 3D survey would be \"1000 meters and deeper\".144\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014, p. 2 (C-66).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014,

geological costs were spread over the surface areas, with the result that those costs were higher for Snina than for Medzilaborce although no drilling was planned for Snina, adding that \"Romgaz does not want to allocate costs based on surface basis\".145\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014, p. 2 (C-66).\n\n124.\n\nFinally, Mr. Lewis discussed the need to apply for an additional concession area \"south of the Radvan project area\", since that additional area was \"necessary for the 3D seismic survey\".146 When asked if AOG could start the 3D survey before obtaining the new concession area, Mr. Lewis answered \"no\", because the Ministry had advised him that \"AOG cannot acquire any data on a license it does not hold\".147\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014, p. 3 (C-66).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 28 November 2014, p. 3 (C-66).\n\n125.\n\nAccording to the 2014 annual reports provided to the MoE, the cost for the MT measurement and processing amounted to EUR 190,878.40 (EUR 116,367.04 in Medzilaborce, EUR 45,368.34 in Svidn\u00edk and EUR 29,143.02 in Snina).148 The JV Partners also spent EUR 151,970.74 on drilling preparation, EUR 55,368.63 on geological services, and EUR 20,661.33 on uncovered operator and overhead work. Thus, for 2014, the JV's total expenditures on geological work and work management amounted to EUR 418,879.10 (EUR 286,554.46 in Medzilaborce, EUR 85,673.22 in Svidn\u00edk and EUR 46,651.42 in Snina).149\n\nAOG Report to MOE \u2013 Medzilaborce, 2014 (C-252); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Snina, 2014 (C-253); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Svidn\u00edk, 2014 (C-254).\n\nAOG Report to MOE \u2013 Medzilaborce, 2014 (C-252); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Snina, 2014 (C-253); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Svidn\u00edk, 2014 (C-254).\n\n126.\n\nThe 2015 budget was approved by Romgaz on 2 February 2015 and by JKX on 5 February 2015.150 The total budgeted costs for that year amounted to EUR 16,096,799, divided into EUR 3,896,799 as \"2015 firm budget\" and EUR 12,200,000 as \"2015 optional budget\", and comprising EUR 2,600,000 in Q1 for drilling costs of \"firm wells\", EUR 5,700,000 in Q3 for \"optional wells\", EUR 1,350,000 in Q1 and Q3 for \"Completion and testing \u2013 optional\", and EUR 4,800,000 in Q3 for \"3D seismic \u2013 optional\".151 Regarding drilling costs more specifically, the budget envisioned spending EUR 2,600,000 in Q1 to drill \"firm wells\" in the Medzilaborce area and respectively EUR 1,900,000 in Q3 to drill \"optional wells\" in Svidn\u00edk and Snina.\n\nJOA Budget, 2 February 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-68).\n\nJOA Budget, 2 February 2015, p. 1 of the pdf document (C-68).\n\n127.\n\nOn 24 June 2015, Mr. Lewis told the JV Partners that AOG would \"start the 3-D seismic design process\", including a \"detailed cost estimate on the permitting, acquisition and processing of the data\", and also stated that, once approved by the Operating Committee, AOG would \"go out for bid\".152\n\nEmail of 25 June 2015 from Mike Lewis to Partners, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-78).\n\n128.\n\nOn 25 August 2015, Mr. Lewis informed his JV Partners that drilling programs had been submitted to the Mining Authority for wells planned at Smilno-1, Stromy-1 (which AOG renamed Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka in 2015) and Poruba-1.153\n\nPartner Progress Report, 25 August 2015 (C-79).\n\n129.\n\nOn 16 September 2015, a fourth Operating Committee Meeting took place.154 During that meeting, AOG explained to its partners that it had been \"working full time since the beginning of the year\" to obtain permits for the O\u013eka and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka wells, but that the \"process was significantly delayed because of protests and Ministry issues\".155\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015 (C-81); Opcom Presentation, 16 September 2015 (C-80).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 1 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\n130.\n\nRegarding the O\u013eka site, Mr. Crow stated that \"[m]atters had been going smoothly\" \"until some protests were made\" about \"possibly drilling shale gas wells\", which then led \"the Wolf environmental group\" to appear and use \"quite unscrupulous methods to whip up local anxiety\". This had led \"the Ministry\" to slow down its approval process, thus prompting AOG \"to suspend\" that process and change its focus to obtaining a permit for Poruba-1, which location, other than \"a road access issue that is currently being resolved\", \"basically appears ready to drill\".156 JKX and Romgaz stated that they would not oppose replacing the O\u013eka well with the Poruba well but stated that this should be submitted to the operating committee for approval, to which AOG responded that \"it had not properly followed JOA protocols, and promised to do better in the future\".157\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\n131.\n\nRegarding the Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka site, AOG explained that the \"well is basically ready to drill, pending formal acceptance by the Ministry committee\", which should be given in October 2015.158\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\n132.\n\nFinally, regarding the Smilno-1 site, AOG repeated that the \"location is basically ready to drill\".159 Concern was expressed that time had been spent on permitting the Smilno well location \"even though this well had not been formally approved by the operating committee\".160\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\n133.\n\nMore generally, Romgaz \"expressed concern about the timing of the drilling program, saying that if the wells are not drilled by February at the latest\", insufficient time would remain to review the test results and obtain the approval of its board to apply for license extensions in February 2016.161 JKX for its part stated that funds had been approved \"to drill two wells this year\" and added that it had \"a very strong preference for drilling to be commenced this year\".162 AOG responded that new AFEs and the \"remaining location approvals\" would be ready \"by [the] end of October 2015\".163\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-81).\n\n134.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, a fifth Operating Committee meeting took place, during which AOG updated its partners about the status of the Smilno-1, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka-1 and Poruba-1 wells, its engagement with local activists, and its intention to relinquish part of the license areas in its upcoming license extension requests.164 The JV Partners approved the AFE for the Poruba-1 well, as well as the 2016 work program and budget.165 Regarding the well timing, AOG provided the following information:\n\n\"The first well location is expected to be ready by 15 January and all three locations are due to be ready shortly after that. Alpine [is] expected to have the first well drilled by the end of January and to be starting on the third well by the beginning of March. The current plan is to start with the AOG Smilno #1 well, although the order could change depending on the weather and other factors. The expectation is to put the AOG Smilno #1 (gas) well on a 'short term' test and to put the AOG Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka #1 and AOG Poruba #1 (oil) wells on long term test as soon as possible after drilling\".166\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 December 2015 (C-100).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, p. 4 of the pdf document (C-100); 2016 JOA Budget, 3 December 2015 (C-97).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-100).\n\n135.\n\nRegarding \"PR and activist groups\", AOG provided the following update:\n\n\"There were no particular pending issues to report with local activists. However, Mr. [REDACTED] reported that there had been approaches from the local press seeking information. It is important to respond to these requests as the press might otherwise seek answers from sources less well disposed towards Alpine [AOG]. Mr. [REDACTED] therefore proposed some form of engagement with the local press in early January in order to communicate Alpine's [AOG's] key messages\".167\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-100).\n\n136.\n\nAccording to the 2015 annual reports filed with the MoE, the JV Partners spent a total of EUR 987,351 on geological work and work management.168 This included EUR 148,849 on geological work (EUR 42,415 in Svidn\u00edk, EUR 80,242 in Medzilaborce and EUR 26,192 in Snina), EUR 426,438 on \"Work Control \u2013 Drilling Preparation\", EUR 122,154 on \"Permitting (handling of entries and conflicts)\", EUR 65,097 on technical works and EUR 202,206 on the purchase of material for drilling.169\n\nAOG Report to MOE \u2013 Medzilaborce, 2015 (C-261); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Snina, 2015 (C-263); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Svidn\u00edk, 2015 (C-264).\n\nAOG Report to MOE \u2013 Medzilaborce, 2015 (C-261); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Snina, 2015 (C-263); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Svidn\u00edk, 2015 (C-264).\n\n137.\n\nOn 16 February 2016, the JV Partners amended the 2016 budget,170 and on 11 October 2016, Mr. Lewis provided a \"Well Reports\" to the JV Partners, regarding the Smilno-1, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka-1, Poruba-1, Zborov-1 and Habura-1 locations.171\n\n2016 JOA Budget Amendment, 16 February 2016 (C-297).\n\nAOG report to JKX and Romgaz, 11 October 2016 (C-148).\n\n138.\n\nOn 8 November 2016, a sixth Operating Committee Meeting was held,172 at which AOG told its partners that \"[s]ome further MT points had been processed and interpreted, and the geological case for the main targets was reviewed, including the Zborov and Habura targets\".173 Mr. Fraser summarized AOG's efforts \"to overcome protesters and other opposition, working with lobbyists and PR firms\".174 He added that in relation to the Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka site, AOG was facing \"implacable opposition of a junior minister within the Ministry of Agriculture called Mr. [REDACTED], who has staked his reputation on not permitting oil and gas drilling\", which was the reason why AOG had applied for a compulsory access order under Article 29 of the Geology Act.175 He said that AOG was still \"unable to gain access\" to the Poruba site and that it was facing \"determined opposition from a small group of protesters\" at the Smilno site.176\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 3, item 7 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 1, item 2 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes , 8 November 2016, p. 1, item 2 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 1, item 2 (C-342).\n\n139.\n\nThe JV Partners reviewed the 2016 expenditures, noting that non-exploration related expenditures exceeded the budget \"as a result of the considerable obstacles and delays\" and that exploration related expenditures would \"undershoot considerably\".177 They further discussed the 2017 work program and budget. The work program consisted of \"three firm wells\", including the Smilno-1 well \"expected to be drilled before the end of 2016\", and \"two optional wells\".178 AOG informed its partners that it had \"carried out some preliminary work in researching a Zborov well location earlier in the year\" but that it had \"suspended this activity once it had reached the point where an announcement to the local community would be required\".179 Finally, the JV Partners decided to amend the draft work program and budget and approve them at a later date.180\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 2, item 3 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 3, item 6 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 3, item 8 (C-342).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 4, item 11(1) (C-342).\n\n140.\n\nAccording to the 2016 annual reports provided to the MoE, the JV Partners spent a total of EUR 1,290,939.90 on geological work and work management in that year.181 This included EUR 124,431.20 on geological work (EUR 66,564.80 in Svidn\u00edk, EUR 31,380.50 in Medzilaborce and EUR 26,485.90 in Snina), EUR 830,611.90 for well control and preparation (EUR 506,849.60 in Svidn\u00edk, EUR 212,497.60 in Medzilaborce and EUR 111,264.70 in Snina), EUR 193,519.50 on \"Permitting (handling of entries and conflicts) including media and legal services\" (EUR 105,007.40 in Svidn\u00edk, EUR 58,741 in Medzilaborce and EUR 29,771.20 in Snina), EUR 3,609.10 on land leases and EUR 8,419.10 on operating costs.182\n\nAOG Report to MOE \u2013 Medzilaborce, 2016 (C-292); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Snina, 2016 (C-294); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Svidn\u00edk, 2016 (C-295).\n\nAOG Report to MOE \u2013 Medzilaborce, 2016 (C-292); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Snina, 2016 (C-294); AOG Report to MOE \u2013 Svidn\u00edk, 2016 (C-295).\n\n141.\n\nThe 2017 work program and budget was approved by Romgaz on 23 January 2017 and by AOG and JKX on 10 February 2017.183 It contemplated the following exploration activities:\n\n- Drilling of a firm well at Smilno-1 in January 2017 for EUR 839,000;\n\n- Drilling of a firm well at Medzilaborce-1 in February 2017 for EUR 990,000;\n\n- Drilling of a firm well at Snina-1 in June 2017 for EUR 1,145,000;\n\n- Drilling of an optional well at Zborov-1 in May 2017 for EUR 1,020,000;\n\n- Drilling of an optional well at Medzilaborce-2 in July 2017 for EUR 1,386,000; and\n\n- In the month following each drilling an \"[o]ptional\" \"[c]ompletion and testing\", in February-March and June-August 2017, for a total of EUR 1,500,000 (EUR 300,000 for each month).184\n\n2017 JOA Budget, 10 February 2017 (C-367).\n\n2017 JOA Budget, 10 February 2017, p. 1 of the pdf document (C-367).\n\n142.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, there was a seventh (and apparently final) Operating Committee Meeting.185 Mr. Fraser first provided an update about local opposition. He explained that AOG had \"been speaking to the activists and VLK for much of this year\", and that it had agreed to complete \"a preliminary EIA for each location\" in exchange for the activists \"withdraw[ing] their opposition and allow[ing] Alpine [AOG] to drill\".186 He said that AOG had already applied for \"preliminary EIA clearance\" and that AOG's consultants Chempro had advised that those applications \"would go through without any issues\".187 That said, in the case of Smilno and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, decisions had already been issued requiring \"a longer form of impact assessment\", but that the scope had still to be determined.188 An appeal against the Rusk\u00e1 Poruba decision had been filed. The partners then discussed the option of leaving the JV, with JKX and Romgaz stating that they \"would discuss it and determine if they wanted to continue the project, and on what basis\".189 They then tabled the approval of the 2018 budget until the partners decided whether they would remain engaged in the project or not.190\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 October 2017 (C-382).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 October 2017, p. 1 of the pdf document, item 2.A.

On 6 December 2015, AOG started to level the Smilno site to prepare it for drilling operations. On 14 December 2015, AOG's access to the site was blocked because Ms. Varjanov\u00e1, one of the co-owners of the road, had parked her car, a green Renault, across the Access Road.220 She replaced that car on 17 December 2015 with a white Fiat van.221\n\nEmail of 14 December 2015 from [REDACTED] to AOG team with attached Police reports, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-102); Fraser WS1, para. 36.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 37.\n\n162.\n\nOn 17 December 2015, \"for a nominal \u20ac100\" AOG purchased a 1/700 ownership share of the Access Road from one of its co-owners, Mr. [REDACTED], one of the two individuals from whom it had previously obtained a lease for parcel 2732/1.222\n\nFraser WS1, para. 38; Fraser WS2, para. 10.

Letter of 21 December 2016 from AOG to the Ministry of Environment, pp. 1-2 of the pdf document (C-162).\n\n259.\n\nIn an article published on 27 January 2017, Minister S\u00f3lymos is quoted saying that AOG had complied with applicable legislation and that there was \"no legal or legitimate reason\" for revoking its licenses, as some opponents were demanding. He added that \"[t]o this day, we at the Ministry are not aware of even a single environment-related problem occurring as the consequence of those 8,000 prospector bore holes\". He also stated that AOG accepted to perform voluntary preliminary EIAs for \"new bore holes\":\n\n\"On the other hand, they [i.e. AOG] admitted that there was nothing that would prevent them from conducting a screening/fact-finding procedure if new bore holes were to be drilled within their exploration area, even though they are not required to do this under the law.

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Preliminary Objections**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or the admissibility of the claims on several grounds:421\n\n(i) Discovery is not a protected investor under the BIT because it is a mailbox company lacking activities and assets;422\n\n(ii) Discovery made no qualifying investment under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, because it is a \"pass-through entity\", with no identifiable assets or \"contribution of its own\" and because any funds disbursed originated either from \"Mr. Lewis, other companies he owned or controlled, and Akard\";423\n\n(iii) Discovery did not make a qualifying investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, since it did not make a \"significant\" or \"substantial\" contribution and took no risk;424\n\n(iv) Pursuant to Article X(1) of the BIT, Discovery cannot invoke the BIT's substantive obligations, since the claims arise out of measures taken to maintain public order, to prevent \"civil unrest\", and to protect Slovakia's \"environment and drinking water\";425\n\n(v) Based on the carve-outs in Annex I of the BIT in relation to \"ownership of real property\" and \"hydrocarbons\", Discovery's claims of discriminatory treatment are \"inadmissible or otherwise outside this Tribunal's jurisdiction\";426\n\n(vi) Discovery's corporate structure breaches good faith and amounts to an abuse of process.427 Moreover, Discovery has unclean hands because Mr. Crow faked an injury and AOG disregarded the Interim Injunction;428\n\n(vii) Discovery failed to comply with the procedural precondition set forth in Article VI(2) of the BIT to consult and negotiate before acceding arbitration.429\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 221-262; Rejoinder, paras. 217-248; Tr.

Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimant responds that the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent \"are all misconceived\"430 and submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute and that all of its claims are admissible.431 More specifically, its position is as follows:\n\n(i) As a US company, Discovery is a protected investor under the BIT;432\n\n(ii) Discovery made protected investments under the BIT, including \"its ownership of and interest in AOG and its economic interest in AOG's assets (in particular, the Licences)\", and expended \"each year\" \"significant sums\" in AOG's exploration activities\";433\n\n(iii) Discovery made a protected investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention because the BIT's definition of investment \"automatically\" satisfies the definition in Article 25(1) and, in any event, Discovery made a \"substantial contribution of time, money and resources\" in the \"expectation of a commercial return and at its own risk\";434\n\n(iv) Slovakia's reliance on Article X(1) of the BIT is \"misconceived\", since that provision only operates as a defense on liability, imposes \"strict conditions\", is not \"self-judging\", and the Respondent identifies no measures that were \"necessary\" to protect public order or essential security interests;435\n\n(v) The Respondent cannot rely on the exceptions listed in the Annex of the BIT in relation to \"ownership of real property\" and \"hydrocarbons\", since it failed to notify the US, either before or after the BIT's entry into force, of a derogation to the obligation of national treatment under Article II(1) of the BIT;436\n\n(vi) Discovery acted in good faith; as a matter of US and Texas law, a limited liability company with a single shareholder \"automatically\" qualifies as a \"pass-through\" entity for tax purposes;437\n\n(vii) Discovery complied with the procedural preconditions under Article VI(2) and (3)(a) of the BIT.438\n\nTr.

Substantive Claims**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimant alleges four substantive violations of the BIT: unfair and inequitable treatment, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, failure to provide effective means, and unlawful expropriation. The Claimant submits that it was subjected to a \"torrent of regulatory inconsistency, arbitrary decision-making, and discriminatory treatment\" by Slovakia, in addition to measures violating its legitimate expectations to conduct exploratory drilling and measures amounting to an indirect expropriation.439\n\nReply, para. 3.\n\n274.\n\nFor the Claimant, those measures, whether individually or collectively, \"completely wiped out the value\" of its investment, since they \"prevented AOG from performing its basic obligations to Slovakia under the Licences, namely to complete its geological exploration\".440 The Claimant argues in this context that, but for Slovakia's conduct, AOG \"would have drilled multiple wells and those wells would have yielded substantial discoveries of oil and gas\".441\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it legitimately relied on representations and assurances contained in the Exploration Licenses, renewals and extensions, that AOG would be able to drill exploratory wells in the license areas.442 However, the Slovak Republic frustrated those expectations by preventing AOG from drilling exploration wells at Smilno and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka,443 and by obliging AOG to perform preliminary EIAs and then ordering it to perform full EIAs.444\n\nReply, paras. 268-277.\n\nReply, para. 289(1).\n\nReply, para. 289(2).\n\n276.\n\nIn respect of **Smilno**, the Claimant contends that the police's failure to secure access to the drill site, including its refusal to remove vehicles and activists and to approve road signs; the State prosecutor's abuse of authority by \"intervening in a civil dispute\" between AOG and Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 and instructing the police to cancel its policing operation; and the MoI's instruction to the police that the Access Road was a private road all prevented AOG from drilling at Smilno.445 It asserts that no land owner consent was required to use the Access Road since it was \"publicly accessible\", and that all necessary permits and consents had been secured.446 Moreover, the Slovak judiciary denied justice to Discovery by preventing AOG from using the Access Road.447 Additionally, the \"unwarranted and unreasonable delay\" in dealing with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's appeal breached the effective means standard under Article II(6) of the BIT.448 Those measures were also inconsistent and arbitrary,449 and contributed to the creeping expropriation of the Claimant's investments.450\n\nMemorial, paras. 227-231; Reply, paras. 3(1) and 291-298.\n\nReply, para. 292.\n\nMemorial, para. 228; Reply, paras. 337-348.\n\nMemorial, paras. 258-262; Reply, para. 370.\n\nMemorial, paras. 230, 233-234 and 239-257; Reply, paras. 316 and 329-331.\n\nMemorial, paras. 263-269; Reply, paras. 373-381.\n\n277.\n\nIn relation to **Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka**, the Claimant argues that the MoA's refusal to approve the extension of the Lease and the MoE's refusal to grant access to the site under Article 29 of the Geology Act, based on an \"instruction from higher up\", coupled with the suspension of the Article 29 proceedings, also breached its expectation to be able to drill an exploration well at that site.451 Those measures were equally inconsistent, arbitrary, non-transparent and discriminatory,452 and contributed to the creeping expropriation of the Discovery's investments.453 Furthermore, the delays in handling AOG's Article 29 Application and appeal breached the effective means provision of the BIT.454\n\nMemorial, paras. 232-234; Reply, paras. 3(2), 138 and 299-304.\n\nMemorial, paras. 230 and 233-234; Reply, paras. 317, 332-334 and 359-366.\n\nMemorial, paras. 263-269; Reply, paras. 373-381.\n\nMemorial, para. 262(2); Reply, paras. 370-372.\n\n278.\n\nFinally, in connection with the **EIA process**, it is the Claimant's submission that the decisions of the district offices ordering a full EIA for Smilno, Rusk\u00e1 Poruba and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, as well as the MoE requirement for a preliminary EIA for future wells undermined its expectation that it would be able to proceed with its exploration program. In addition, the decisions were arbitrary, inconsistent with prior statements of the MoE and discriminatory.455 They also contributed to the creeping expropriation of the Claimant's investments.456 For the Claimant, ordering full EIAs and imposing a preliminary EIA for future wells \"was the last nail in the coffin of Discovery's investment and [\u2026]precipitated the withdrawal of AOG's JV Partners and ultimately destroyed the value of Discovery's investment\".457\n\nMemorial, paras. 235-238; Reply, paras. 3(3), 318, 335 and 367-369.\n\nMemorial, paras. 263-269; Reply, paras. 373-381.\n\nMemorial, para. 238.\n\n**2. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent denies having breached any standard under the BIT and requests that all of Discovery's claims be dismissed.458 It argues that it acted \"entirely\" consistently with its international obligations and that the claims are \"manifestly baseless\".459\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 272-425; Rejoinder, paras. 249-527.\n\nRejoinder, para. 249.\n\n280.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent disputes having frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations,460 acted inconsistently461 or arbitrarily in respect to the Smilno and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka sites or the EIA process,462 denied justice to Discovery or AOG,463 breached the effective means standard,464 or having indirectly expropriated the Claimant's investments.465\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 294-344; Rejoinder, paras. 257-398.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 345-355; Rejoinder, paras. 399-426.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 427-473.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 356-373; Rejoinder, paras. 474-491.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 401-408; Rejoinder, paras. 508-514.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 409-424; Rejoinder, paras. 515-527.\n\n281.\n\nIn respect of **Smilno**, the Respondent asserts that \"it was AOG's legal mistakes and failure to obtain landowner consent that resulted in its downfall\".466 AOG had no right to use the Access Road467 and was bound to respect the Interim Injunction. Discovery's argument according to which that \"field track\" was a public special purpose road (\"PSPR\") is an \"after-the-fact\" invention that AOG never invoked at the time.468 Neither the Bardejov District Court's decision to grant the Interim Injunction nor the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court's decision to uphold that injunction were arbitrary or biased against AOG.469 The statutory conditions for the Interim Injunction were satisfied, in particular the threat of imminent harm.470\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 312-322; Rejoinder, paras. 288-327.\n\nRejoinder, para. 296.\n\nRejoinder, para. 291.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 369-373; Rejoinder, paras. 481-491.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 370; Rejoinder, para. 482, referring to Foga\u0161 ER1, section 3.1.3; Foga\u0161 ER2, section II.A.3.\n\n282.\n\nComing to **Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka**, neither the MoA's denial of the Lease Amendment nor the MoE's refusal to issue a compulsory access order barred Discovery from drilling in Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka.471 The MoA did not approve the Lease Amendment because AOG did not request an extension of the Lease in time.472 As for the MoE, it denied an access order for lack of proof that AOG had been unable to conclude a new lease with LSR.473 The argument that there was an instruction from the highest level of the MoE is \"divorced from common sense\".474 The Minister of Environment, Mr. S\u00f3lymos, denies having given such instruction and later quashed the MoE's decision.475\n\nRejoinder, para. 328.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 334-343.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 348-356.\n\nRejoinder, para. 358.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 357-360.\n\n283.\n\nTurning to the **EIAs**, the Respondent stresses that Discovery \"*volunteered* to undergo Preliminary EIAs\" for Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, and, hence, could not legitimately expect not to be subject to a preliminary EIA.476 Discovery is wrong to argue that the district offices should have refrained from entertaining the preliminary EIA applications, or that it legitimately expected that the preliminary EIAs would not progress to full EIAs.477 In the same vein, Discovery erroneously argues that it legitimately expected that the EIA Amendment would not apply to its post-2017 drills.478 The inclusion of a preliminary EIA requirement in the 2018 extension of the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License was \"in accordance with the EIA Amendment\" and thus not \"illegitimate\".479 In any event, AOG could have appealed that decision but chose not to.480\n\nEmphasis in the original.

ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Preliminary matters**\n--------------------------\n\n290.\n\nPrior to addressing the Parties' dispute, the Tribunal will address certain preliminary matters: (1) the applicable procedural law, (2) the law governing jurisdiction, (3) the law governing the merits, (4) the relevance of previous decisions or awards and (5) adverse inferences.\n\n**1. Applicable procedural law and transparency**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThis arbitration is governed by the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, and the procedural orders adopted in the course of this arbitration, in particular PO1.\n\n292.\n\nPO2 set out the transparency rules applicable to the present proceedings, which are based on the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State Arbitration adjusted to ICSID proceedings. More specifically, as reflected in PO2, the Parties agreed to publish the Parties' main written submissions, the lists of exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements and expert reports; non-disputing party submissions and the Parties' written observations thereon; hearing transcripts; procedural orders, decisions and the award. The Parties further agreed to make the recording of the Hearing accessible on the ICSID website. Publication is subject to the protection of \"confidential and protected\" information as specified in PO2.\n\n**2. Law governing jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nIt is common ground that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is governed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article VI of the BIT. In other words, jurisdiction is governed by international law.\n\n294.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\".\n\n295.\n\nIn turn, Article VI of the BIT reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"1. For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute involving (a) the interpretation or application of an investment agreement between a Party and a national or company of the other Party; (b) the interpretation or application of any investment authorization granted by Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party, the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third party procedures. Subject to paragraph 3 of this Article, if the dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and negotiation, the dispute shall be submitted for settlement in accordance with previously agreed, applicable disputed-settlement procedures; any dispute-settlement procedures, including those relating to expropriation, specified in the investment agreement shall remain binding and shall be enforceable in accordance with the terms of the investment agreement, relevant provisions of domestic laws and applicable international agreements regarding enforcement of arbitral awards.\n\n3. (a) At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ('Centre') or to the Additional Facility of the Centre or pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ('UNCITRAL') or pursuant to the arbitration rules of any arbitral institution mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute. Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may institute such proceeding provided:\n\n(i) the dispute has not been submitted by the national or company for resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; and\n\n(ii) the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a party to the dispute.\n\nIf the parties disagree over whether conciliation or binding arbitration is the more appropriate procedure to be employed, the opinion of the national or company concerned shall prevail.\n\n(b) Each Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment dispute for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the Centre, in the event that the Government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic becomes a party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States done at Washington, March 18, 1965 ('Convention') and the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, and to the Additional Facility of the Centre, and\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(c) Conciliation or arbitration of disputes under (b)(i) shall be done applying the provisions of the Convention and the Regulations and Rules of the Centre, or of the Additional Facility as the case may be.\n\n(d) The place of any arbitration conducted under this Article shall be a country which is a party to the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards signed at New York in 1958.\n\n(e) Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any award resulting from an arbitration held in accordance with this Article VI. Further, each Party shall provide for the enforcement in its territory of such arbitral awards.\n\n[\u2026]\".485\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article VI (C-1).\n\n**3. Law governing the merits**\n-------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nDiscovery's claims are based on rights and obligations set forth in the BIT. Hence, the BIT is the primary source of law governing the merits of the dispute.\n\n297.\n\nThe BIT contains no choice of law provision. As a consequence, if an issue finds no answer in the BIT, the Tribunal will have to apply the law of the host State and international law \"as may be applicable\", or in the terms of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable\".\n\n298.\n\nIn applying the BIT and, if necessary, Slovak law and \"such rules of international law as may be applicable\", it will be for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law.\n\n**4. Iura novit curia**\n-----------------------\n\n299.\n\nWhen applying the law, the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. In accordance with the principle *iura novit curia* a tribunal may form its own opinion about the meaning of the law, provided it does not surprise the Parties with a legal theory that they could not anticipate.486\n\nSee, for instance, *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland)*, Merits, Judgment, 25 July 1974, para. 18; *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, para. 295; *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL Case, Award, 23 April 2012 (hereinafter \"*Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic*\"), para. 141 (RL-75).\n\n**5. Relevance of previous decisions or awards**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nIn support of their positions, both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same approach should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from an approach reached by another tribunal.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other arbitral tribunals. At the same time, however, the Tribunal considers that, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, it may take note of, and be guided by, the legal solutions reflected in a series of consistent cases, subject, of course, to the specifics of the BIT and to the circumstances of the actual case. In so doing, the Tribunal is of the view that it will contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.\n\n**6. Adverse inferences**\n-------------------------\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to comply with several of the Tribunal's document production orders in PO3 and requests that the Tribunal infer that the documents which the Respondent failed to produce in breach of PO3 are adverse to its pleaded case.487 The Claimant observes that Slovakia only produced 40 responsive documents requests granted by the Tribunal,488 when itself it produced over 2,000 documents voluntarily.489\n\nReply, para. 9.\n\nReply, para. 9.\n\nReply, para. 9.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimant makes the following requests for adverse inferences:\n\n\u2022 Request No. 1: the Respondent having failed to produce \"any documents\" in relation to the events of 18 June 2016 without satisfactory explanation, the Claimant requests an adverse inference that Dr. Slosar\u010dikov\u00e1 \"abused her authority by intervening in a civil dispute and/or instructing the Police to cancel their policing operation\";490\n\n\u2022 Request No. 2: the Respondent having failed to produce documents \"evidencing the Police's internal consideration\" of the road signage \"scheme\" leading to its decision on 11 October 2016 without satisfactory explanation, the Claimant requests an inference \"that the Police refused to approve the signs at the entrance of the Road because Mr [REDACTED] and/or Mr [REDACTED] made a personal decision to thwart AOG's exploration activities at Smilno\";491\n\n\u2022 Request No. 3: the Respondent having failed to produce documents from January to June 2016 about the decision-making process of Minister Matecna or Mr.[REDACTED] and about \"the reason why the Minister took the unusual decision to sign the letter dated 23 June 2016 instead of Mr [REDACTED]\", the Claimant seeks an inference that these documents \"would reveal that: *(i)* the MoA's decision-making process was arbitrary, opaque and lacking in good faith, and (*ii*) the MoA's reasons for refusing to approve the Amendment were pretextual\";492\n\n\u2022 Request No. 4: the Respondent having failed to produce \"internal communications within and between State Forestry and the MoA evidencing their internal consideration of AOG's request between 18 July 2016 and 25 October 2016\" (see PO3, Annex A, Request No. 7(i)), the Claimant requests the Tribunal to infer \"that such documents would be adverse to the interests of Slovakia\" and show that the MoA's decision was arbitrary and pretextual;493\n\n\u2022 Request No. 5: the Respondent having failed to produce documents evidencing the \"instruction from the high levels of' the MoE in March 2017 relayed by Mr. [REDACTED] to AOG's lawyers (see PO3, Annex A, Request 7), the Claimant requests the Tribunal to infer that these documents are \"adverse\" to Slovakia's case;494 and\n\n\u2022 Request No. 6: the Respondent having failed to produce internal communications of the district offices \"relating to their consideration of AOG's applications or the preparation of the EIA Decisions\", the Claimant requests that the Tribunal infer that these documents are \"adverse to Slovakia's case\".495\n\nReply, para. 97.\n\nReply, para. 109.\n\nReply, para. 124.\n\nReply, para. 132.\n\nReply, para. 138(4).\n\nReply, para. 183.\n\n304.\n\nIn general, the response of the Respondent is that Discovery, being unable to discharge its burden of proof, is attempting to have the Respondent \"carry that burden for it\", with the result that Discovery's case rests almost exclusively on \"baseless\" requests for adverse inferences\".496\n\nRejoinder, paras. 16 and 205-215.\n\n305.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent provides the following responses:\n\n\u2022 Request No. 1 : the Respondent states that it informed Discovery \"why no documents exist\", especially since Dr. Slosarcikov\u00e2 \"was not obliged to prepare any report related to her trip to Smilno\";497\n\n\u2022 Request No. 2: the Respondent answers that the police inspectorate contemporaneously told AOG why the road signage scheme was refused, namely because \"the field track was not a PSPR\";498\n\n\u2022 Request No. 3 : the Respondent comments that the MoA denied the extension of the Lease because AOG had \"missed the deadline\";499\n\n\u2022 Request No. 4: in relation to communications about the \"new lease agreement\", Slovakia responds that \"AOG knew contemporaneously that LSR [i.e. State Forestry] did not forward [the new lease agreement] to the MoA and that was why the MoA did not receive it\";500\n\n\u2022 Request No. 5: the Respondent opposes that the request for instructions from \"higher ups at the MoE\" is \"absurd\" since it asks to prove a negative, considering that Minister S\u00f3lymos testified that \"there was no instruction\";501 and\n\n\u2022 Request No. 6: the Respondent answers that it explained to Discovery why there were no drafts of the preliminary EIA decisions \"and why no communications between the District Offices were located\".502\n\nRejoinder, para. 210(a), referring to Letter of 22 June 2023 from Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP to Signature Litigation (C-416).\n\nRejoinder, para. 210(b).\n\nRejoinder, para. 210(c).\n\nRejoinder, para. 210(d).\n\nRejoinder, para. 210(e).\n\nRejoinder, para. 210(f), referring to Letter of 22 June 2023 from Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP to Signature Litigation (C-416).\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal will address these requests for adverse inferences in the course of its analysis if and where appropriate.\n\n**B. Preliminary Objections**\n-----------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimant initiated this arbitration pursuant to Article VI of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (the relevant parts of which are reproduced at paragraphs 294 and 295 above). The Tribunal must ensure *ex officio* that the Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal is competent to exercise that jurisdiction over the dispute. In this context, it is undisputed that the Tribunal is the \"judge of its own competence\", as established in Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n308.\n\nAt the outset, it is common ground that the Slovak Republic is a successor State to the BIT, that the Slovak Republic signed the ICSID Convention on 27 September 1993, and that the Convention entered into force in respect of the Slovak Republic on 26 June 1994.\n\n309.\n\nWith respect to the BIT's jurisdictional requirements, the Respondent rightly does not deny that this dispute concerns an alleged breach of a right conferred or created by the BIT with respect to an investment, as required under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT; that it has consented in writing to ICSID arbitration in accordance with Article VI(3) of the BIT; that the Claimant consented in writing to ICSID arbitration and that it also validly selected ICSID arbitration for purposes of resolving the dispute. Neither does the Respondent argue that an exception listed in Article VI(3)(a) applies.\n\n310.\n\nAs regards the requirements under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent rightly does not contest that the dispute is a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between an ICSID Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. By contrast, Slovakia challenges jurisdiction on the following grounds:\n\n\u2022 Discovery is not a qualifying investor (Section 1 below);\n\n\u2022 Discovery has no qualifying investment under the BIT because it neither contributed nor engaged in an act of investing (Section 2 below);\n\n\u2022 Discovery has no qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention because it made no substantial contribution and took no risks (Section 3 below);\n\n\u2022 Discovery's use of corporate forms is such that it made no *bona fide* investment (Section 4 below);\n\n\u2022 Discovery's unclean hands in connection with Mr. Crow's faking of an injury and AOG's disregard of the Interim Injunction is a jurisdictional or admissibility bar (Section 5 below; objections added at the Hearing);503\n\n\u2022 Discovery's failure to comply with procedural preconditions to arbitration contained in Article VI(2) of the BIT renders its claims inadmissible (Section 6 below);\n\n\u2022 The claims concern measures required to maintain public order under Article X(1) of the BIT (Section 7 below);\n\n\u2022 The national treatment and MFN claims fall under the carve-outs in Annex I(3) of the BIT (Section 8 below).\n\nTr. (Day 1), 193:23-196:6 (Pekar).\n\n311.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent expressly noted that it only raises \"three jurisdictional objections\",504 namely that Discovery has no investment under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and that in any event questions arise whether it made a *bona fide* investment. At the Hearing, the Respondent did not mention these three objections but put forward an unclean hands defense. Therefore, the Tribunal understood that the Respondent no longer pursued the preliminary objections listed in the previous paragraph. Out of abundance of caution, it will nonetheless briefly address those objections.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 196:16-17 (Pekar).\n\n**1. Is Discovery a qualifying investor?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant is not an eligible investor under the BIT because it is a mailbox company lacking activities and assets that made no contribution or act of investing.505 In the Respondent's submission, there is no evidence that Discovery has \"any material purpose or activities other than holding the shares in AOG\", which shares it acquired for nominal consideration.506 Accordingly, its \"naked shareholding, absent any eligible contribution *by* Discovery, is insufficient\".507 It adds that contributions made by third parties, such as Mr. Lewis or Akard, \"do not transform Discovery from a passive asset-holder into an active '*investor*' to which the BIT exceptionally grants international legal rights\".508\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 223-234.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 234.\n\nEmphasis in the original. Counter-Memorial, para. 226.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 234.\n\n313.\n\nThe Claimant responds that the Respondent's position is irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the term investor in the BIT. It adds that the Respondent's active contribution argument has been rejected by numerous tribunals and that it ignores the facts of the case.509 The Claimant highlights that the term \"investor\" does not appear in the BIT and that there is no requirement under Article I(i)(b) of the BIT that a \"company\" make any contribution or act of investing to qualify as an \"investor\".510 It follows, so says the Claimant, that it need not demonstrate that it is an \"investor\" or made a contribution or act of investing for the Tribunal to have *ratione personae* jurisdiction.511\n\nReply, paras. 195-211.\n\nReply, para. 197.\n\nReply, para. 199.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal must ensure that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Claimant. As noted by the Claimant, the BIT does not use the word \"investor\" but the term \"company of a Party\". Article I(1)(b) defines a \"company of a Party\" as:\n\n\"any kind of corporation, company, association, state or other enterprise, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned\".512\n\nBIT, Article I(1)(b) (C-1).\n\n315.\n\nMoreover, Article VI(2) of the BIT contemplates investment disputes \"between a Party and a national or company of the other Party\" and Article VI(3) allows the concerned \"national or company\" to consent in writing to submit such investment disputes to ICSID arbitration.513\n\nBIT, Articles VI(2) and (3) (C-1).\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute, and rightly so, that Discovery is a \"company of a Party\" pursuant to Article I(1)(b) of the BIT. The record indeed confirms that Discovery is a privately held company incorporated in the State of Texas, USA.514 Specifically, the company Blue Sky Aircraft Services, LLC was registered on 4 December 2006 in Texas.515 That company changed its name to Discovery Polska, LLC on 3 September 2013 and then again to Discovery Global, LLC on 20 July 2016.516 There is thus no question that Discovery is a \"company of a Party\".\n\nDiscovery Global LLC Certificate of Incorporation, 4 December 2006 (C-28).\n\nDiscovery Global LLC Certificate of Incorporation, 4 December 2006, p. 6 of the pdf document (C-28).\n\nDiscovery Global LLC Certificate of Incorporation, 4 December 2006, pp. 1-5 of the pdf document (C-28).\n\n317.\n\nThe question of the existence of an active contribution by Discovery is irrelevant to whether the Claimant qualifies as a \"company of a Party\". In reality, it goes to the existence of a protected investment, which the Tribunal will address in the following section.\n\n318.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Claimant.\n\n**2. Did Discovery make a qualifying investment under the BIT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* on the ground that the Claimant has no eligible investment under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT because it made no contribution or active investment.517 It argues that any funds disbursed originated either from \"Mr. Lewis, other companies he owned or controlled, and Akard\".518 Specifically, out of the USD 3.7 million alleged sunk costs, USD 2 million were borrowed from Mr. Lewis and the remainder provided by Discovery GeoServices Corporation, Alpha Exploration LLC, or Akard.519 None of those contributions were made *by* Discovery.520\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 233; Rejoinder, paras. 218 and 224-233.\n\nRejoinder, para. 218.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 220-222; Tr. (Day 1), 198:11-17 (Pekar); Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 164-167 (RP-1), referring to *Rand Investments Ltd. and others v. Republic of Serbia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/8, Award, 29 June 2023 (hereinafter \"*Rand v. Serbia*\"), para. 237 (CL-99).\n\nTr. (Day 1), 198:11-17 (Pekar); Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 164-167 (RP-1), referring to *Rand v. Serbia*, para. 237 (CL-99).\n\n320.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent invokes *Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania* to argue that Discovery did not actively contribute to an investment and that passive shareholding is insufficient.521 In reliance on *Rand v. Serbia,* it also submits that, since there is no economic link between those contributions and Discovery, the Claimant did not demonstrate that it bore the financial burden of those contributions.522\n\nCounter-Memorial paras. 232-234; Rejoinder, paras. 219 and 224-233, referring to *Standard Chartered Bank v. United Republic of Tanzania I*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, Award, 2 November 2012 (hereinafter \"*Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania*\"), paras. 227-228 and 257 (RL-42).\n\nTr. (Day 1), 198:11-17 (Pekar); Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 164-167 (RP-1), referring to *Rand v. Serbia*, para. 237 (CL-99).\n\n321.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that any dispute arising out of Discovery's alleged interest in the Exploration Licenses before 2020 falls outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, because AOG held only a 50% interest in those licenses until JKX and Romgaz withdrew in 2018 and 2020 respectively.523 It follows, says the Respondent, that Discovery did not own or control an eligible investment \"until, at the earliest, 2020\".524\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 235-238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 238.\n\n322.\n\nThe Claimant responds that its shares in AOG and its economic interest in the Exploration Licenses qualify as protected investments under the BIT.525 It explains that Discovery paid for its interest in AOG and expended \"significant sums in exploration activities\".526 The argument that Discovery's acquisition of AOG was for \"nominal consideration\" ignores that Discovery funded AOG's activities from 2014 onwards.527 In addition, Discovery's \"officers/agents also made a significant and active contribution of time and money into AOG's exploration activities throughout the project\".528 Although the Respondent's \"active contribution\" test is unsupported by \"consistent jurisprudence\" and *Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania* is an \"outlier\", the Claimant in any event satisfies such test.529\n\nMemorial, para. 201(2)-(4); Reply, paras. 195-233.\n\nMemorial, para. 201(5).\n\nReply, paras. 210-211.\n\nReply, para. 206(2).\n\nReply, para. 204.\n\n323.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Slovakia \"concedes that Discovery's ownership of AOG qualifies as an '*investment*' under the BIT\".530 Moreover, the Exploration Licenses qualify as protected investments under Article I(1)(a)(v) of the BIT.531 Since AOG was the operator under the JOAs with \"exclusive charge and conduct of all Joint Operations\", Discovery \"controlled directly or indirectly\" the Exploration Licenses at all relevant times.532\n\nReply, para. 212.\n\nReply, paras. 212-214.\n\nReply, paras. 215-216.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n324.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT defines an \"investment\" as an investment in the territory of the contracting State owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other:\n\n\"(a) 'investment' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights such as mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to:\n\nLiterary and artistic works, including sound recordings, inventions in all fields of human endeavor, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, trade secrets and confidential business information, and trademarks, service marks, and trade names;\n\nand\n\n(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract, or exploit natural resources\".533\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article I(1)(a) (C-1).\n\n325.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that its investments in the Slovak Republic comprised (i) its shares in AOG and (ii) its economic interest in AOG's assets, in particular, the Exploration Licenses.534 It notes that it \"paid for its interest in AOG and its assets\" and later invested sums in exploration activities.535\n\nMemorial, para. 201(4).\n\nMemorial, para. 201(5).\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent rightly agrees that Discovery owned AOG since 2014.536 In March 2014, Discovery acquired 100% of AOG's shares for EUR 153,054.537 Even though the Respondent argues that EUR 153,054 is a \"paltry\" sum, this does not detract from the fact that Discovery paid to acquire AOG's equity and that the ownership of shares qualifies as an investment under Article I(1)(a)(ii) of the BIT. This finding alone suffices to dismiss the Respondent's objection that the Claimant had no qualifying investment.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 237.\n\nParticipation Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement, Article 1.2.1 (C-56).\n\n327.\n\nAs for the Exploration Licenses, the Respondent contends that Discovery did not own or control them, at least not until 2020.538 The record, on the other hand, shows that AOG owned a 50% interest in the licenses and JKX and Romgaz each held 25%.539 In 2018, JKX relinquished its 25% share and Romgaz did the same two years later.540 In other words, between 2014 and 2018, i.e. the time period of the challenged measures, Discovery indirectly owned AOG's 50% interest in the licenses. Since AOG was the operator under the JOA541 and was thus in charge of all operations to develop the license areas,542 the Tribunal additionally considers that AOG's interest amounted to a controlling interest. It follows that Discovery's indirect interest in the licenses qualifies as a protected investment under Article I(1)(a)(v) of the BIT.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 236-238.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nEmail of 16 March 2018 from JKX re. withdrawal (C-187); Letter of 16 March 2018 from JKX re. withdrawal \u2013 Medzilaborce (C-188); Letter of 16 March 2018 from JKX re. withdrawal \u2013 Snina (C-189); Email of 16 March 2018 from JKX re. withdrawal \u2013 Svidn\u00edk (C-190); JKX notice of withdrawal from Medzilaborce, 20 April 2018 (C-195); JKX notice of withdrawal from Snina, 20 April 2018 (C-196); Romgaz formal notice of relinquishment re.

Neither Article I(1)(a) nor Article VI of the BIT require that an investment be \"active\". For the purposes of Article I(1)(a), there must be an \"investment\", without a qualifying adjective, which materializes in an asset situated in a Contracting State.\n\n329.\n\nThe record establishes that Discovery acquired AOG for EUR 153,054.50 and later financed part of AOG's exploration activities. The purchase and sale agreement was entered into by Discovery (at that time still called Discovery Polska, LLC). Although there is no documentary evidence showing the transfer of EUR 153,054.50, the Respondent does not dispute that Discovery made the payment. In fact, it accepted that this amount was \"spent by Discovery to acquire the AOG shares\".543\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 231.\n\n330.\n\nSimilarly, according to the reports provided to the MoE, the JV Partners spent a total of EUR 4,095,719 on exploration between 2014 and 2020.544 Out of that amount, Discovery incurred EUR 2,878,176 million for \"AOG's share of the exploration expenditures incurred on the project between 2014 and 2020\",545 including license fees as well as exploration costs.546\n\nAccording to the reports provided to the MoE, AOG spent a total of EUR 867,102.09 in 2014 (EUR 859,391 according to Mr. Fraser, of which Discovery bore EUR 429,695), EUR 1,454,199 in 2015 (EUR 1,453,198 according to Mr. Fraser, of which Discovery bore EUR 736,199), EUR 1,513,233 in 2016 (of which Discovery bore EUR 769,478), EUR 713,338 in 2017 (of which Discovery bore EUR 366,269), EUR 410,735 in 2018 (EUR 410,699 according to Mr. Fraser, of which Discovery bore EUR 234,883), EUR 274,780 in 2019 (of which Discovery bore EUR 183,196), and EUR 179,725 in 2020 (EUR 178,959 according to Mr. Fraser, of which Discovery bore EUR 158,455).

Serbia*, numerous investment tribunals have held that the origin of capital is irrelevant as long as there is an \"economic link between the funds and the investor\" sufficient to show that the investor \"is the one ultimately bearing the financial burden of the contribution\".548\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 231; Rejoinder, paras. 241 and 245.\n\n*Rand v.

Serbia*, para. 264 (CL-99).\n\n333.\n\nBe that as it may, even if the Tribunal were to question who ultimately bore the financial burden of the contribution, it is not disputed that Discovery, not Mr. Lewis, entered into an agreement with Akard in October 2015, under which Akard agreed to lend USD 3,708,844 million to fund the drilling of three wells in the exploration areas (i.e., the Smilno-1, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka-1 and Poruba-1 wells).552 It is further undisputed that Discovery drew USD 1.95 million under that agreement, which it invested in AOG's operations. The Respondent does not dispute that Discovery has an \"ongoing liability to repay Akard\" for the loan.553 Hence, there is no doubt that Discovery bore the financial burden associated with the contribution.\n\nAgreement between Discovery and Akard, 23 October 2015 (C-282).\n\nReply, para. 244(5).\n\n334.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's objection that Discovery made no investment in the sense of Article I(1)(a) the BIT.\n\n**3. Did Discovery make a qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that Discovery did not have a qualifying investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, since it did not make a \"significant\" or \"substantial\" contribution. It argues that Discovery's claimed sunk costs \"amount to a paltry USD 3.7 million\".554 Relying on *Rand v. Serbia*, the Respondent argues that Discovery failed to make a \"contribution of its own\" and \"therefore cannot use Mr. Lewis' and Akard's contributions to access arbitration\".555 The Respondent adds that, as a \"shell company\" with no assets, Discovery \"took no risks\".556 In other words, \"Discovery does not meet the *Salini* criteria\".557\n\nRejoinder, para. 239.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 243-244, referring to *Rand v.

Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n337.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention subjects jurisdiction to the existence of a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\", without defining the term \"investment\". The Respondent is of the view that this definition is an objective one, whereas the Claimant adopts the definition adopted in the BIT.\n\n338.\n\nThe meaning of the term \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention must be ascertained in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"VCLT\"), namely on the basis of the term's ordinary meaning, in its context, and in the light of the ICSID Convention's object and purpose. In other words, and as many tribunals have held, it is an objective, as opposed to subjective, meaning not dependent on the intent of the parties to the instrument providing consent, here the BIT.562\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

It stresses that, to the extent the ICSID Convention imposes a \"substantial\" or \"significant\" contribution, the amounts discussed there meet this characteristic. The Tribunal further adds to its foregoing analysis, as noted in *Rand v. Serbia*, that what matters is not the form of the contribution but its substance, or reality:\n\n\"In the context of the assessment of the existence of a contribution as a prerequisite for an investment, investment tribunals have long held that contributions to the host State can take several forms, that the origin of capital is irrelevant, and that the reality of the contribution is to be assessed taking into account the totality of the circumstances and the elements of the economic goal pursued\".564\n\n*Rand v. Serbia*, para. 234 (CL-99).\n\n341.\n\nIt cannot seriously be denied that the Claimant assumed a level of risk as there was no certainty that AOG's exploration activities would identify commercially viable reserves.565 In addition, Discovery assumed the financial risk associated with the Akard Agreement.566\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/14, Award, 13 March 2009, paras. 242-243 (CL-79).\n\nReply, para. 244(5).\n\n342.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant made an investment in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**4. Did Discovery make a good faith investment?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent raises an additional objection to jurisdiction or admissibility on the ground that the Claimant's \"use of corporate forms\" breaches good faith and constitutes an abuse of process.567 It contends that US tax documents reveal that Mr. Lewis used Discovery as a pass-through entity to deduct the latter's losses against his personal tax liability,568 stressing that Mr. Lewis admitted using Discovery \"as a pass-through to benefit from his tax liabilities in the US\".569 For Slovakia, Discovery cannot be a pass-through entity, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, an independent operator having its own assets and activities.570\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 221 and 254-257; Rejoinder, para. 247.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 256.\n\nRejoinder, para. 247.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 257.\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimant replies that good faith is not an element of the definition of an investment under the BIT or the ICSID Convention and that no corporate restructuring took place to access arbitration.571 In any event, the Respondent is conflating Mr. Lewis' position with that of Discovery and ignores Discovery's separate legal personality. Under US law, a limited liability company with a sole shareholder like Discovery, automatically becomes a pass-through entity for tax purposes, meaning that its income and expenses are reported on the shareholder's personal tax filing.572 For the Claimant, this \"quirk of US tax law\" has no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction and cannot amount to an abuse of process or a breach of good faith.573\n\nReply, paras. 245-247.\n\nReply, para. 248.\n\nReply, para. 248(4).\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n345.\n\nThere is no indication in the record showing that Discovery's investment in the Slovak Republic was not made in good faith or that Discovery in some way abusively sought access to ICSID arbitration. Actually, the Respondent accepts that the \"use of pass-through entities to reduce an individual's income tax burden is not itself illegal or contrary to good faith\" as a matter of US tax law,574 and has not challenged the Claimant's explanation that US tax law regards a single-shareholder company as a pass-through entity. Since there is no allegation, let alone any evidence before the Tribunal, that Mr. Lewis improperly reported Discovery's income and expenses in his personal tax filings, the Tribunal fails to see any basis for an abuse or lack of good faith argument. More importantly, the US tax practice does not change the fact that Discovery has separate legal personality and owns assets and incurs liabilities.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 257.\n\n346.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objection that the Claimant did not make a good faith investment.\n\n**5. Does Discovery have clean hands?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n347.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent insisted at the Hearing that the Tribunal may apply the unclean hands doctrine *ex officio* to act as a bar to jurisdiction or admissibility.575 As examples of what it considers to be the Claimant's unclean hands, it pointed in particular to Mr. Crow allegedly faking an injury to file a criminal complaint against a Slovak citizen, to AOG's disregard of the injunction prohibiting it to use the Access Road, and to AOG's persistence despite the traffic inspectorate's refusal to qualify that road as a PSPR.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 193:23-196:6 (Pekar).\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant did not address this argument during the Hearing.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent raised its unclean hands objection both as a matter of jurisdiction and of admissibility for the first time at the Hearing.576 It acknowledged that its objection was out of time, but argued that the Tribunal can apply it *ex officio.* While this is correct under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) in respect of jurisdiction, it does not apply to issues of admissibility. The Tribunal will therefore limit its analysis of the Respondent's argument to the question of jurisdiction.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 195:19-22 (Pekar) (\"Yes, Mr Drymer, I'm very well aware of the fact that we are past the deadline for raising such an objection. So that's why we are left with the Tribunal's jurisdiction\").\n\n350.\n\nNeither the BIT nor the ICSID Convention contain a legality clause requiring that investments be made in accordance with the law of the host State. Although investment tribunals have recognized that, absent a legality clause, the unclean hands doctrine may operate as a jurisdictional bar, this is only so in \"particularly serious cases\" where an investment was made through \"illegal, fraudulent, or corrupt means\".577 It is therefore necessary to review the seriousness of the alleged illegality.\n\n*Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016 (hereinafter \"*Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*\"), para. 493; *Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2016-39, Award, 8 September 2023, para. 175.\n\n351.\n\nHere, as mentioned, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's lack of clean hands is illustrated by: (i) Mr. Crow allegedly faking an injury to file a criminal complaint against a Slovak citizen, (ii) AOG's disregard of the injunction prohibiting it to use the Access Road and (iii) its persistence despite the traffic inspectorate's refusal to qualify that road as a PSPR. First, none of these events relate to Discovery's decision to invest in the Slovak Republic; they allegedly occurred during the life of the investment, after it was made. Second, even if true, none of these instances may be said to be sufficiently serious to justify declining jurisdiction over the claims. While they may play a role in the assessment of the facts surrounding the Smilno claims, and will be examined in that context, they are far from rising to the level of conduct leading to a denial of jurisdiction.\n\n**6. Did Discovery satisfy the procedural preconditions to arbitration?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n352.\n\nAt some point in the arbitration, the Respondent contended that the claims were inadmissible because the Claimant failed to observe the procedural conditions in Article VI(2) of the BIT to consult and negotiate before initiating this arbitration.578 Specifically, it argued that the Notice of Dispute did not contain \"any material legal or factual substantiation\" and that the Claimant did not provide the clarifications requested by the Respondent.579 Later the Respondent abandoned this defense, which is addressed here out of an abundance of caution.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 258-262.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 259, referring to Email of 9 February 2021 from the Slovak Republic to Discovery (R-93).\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimant answers that that it complied with Article VI(2) and (3)(a) of the BIT by seeking to resolve the dispute through negotiations and waiting 6 months before submitting the dispute to arbitration.580 It argues that the Notice of Dispute sufficiently informed the Respondent of the treaty breaches subject of this dispute and that the Respondent failed to engage in negotiations.581\n\nMemorial, paras. 202-205.\n\nReply, para. 251.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n354.\n\nArticle VI(2) of the BIT, which is reproduced in paragraph 295 above, states that \"the parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and negotiation\". Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT in turn requires the Claimant to wait six months between the date the dispute arose and the initiation of the arbitration. It is undisputed that the Claimant complied with the six-month cooling off period. The only question is whether the Claimant sought to negotiate.\n\n355.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent only mentioned its objection in the Counter-Memorial and that it did not respond in subsequent submissions to the Claimant's arguments that it complied with Article VI(2) of the BIT. In fact, as noted above, the Respondent stated at the Hearing that it raised only three preliminary objections, none of which concern Article VI(2). The Tribunal therefore understands that the Respondent does not challenge the force of the arguments provided by the Claimant in its Reply and that it effectively waived this objection. In any event, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that it complied with Article VI(2) of the BIT. The Notice of Dispute is 22 pages long and describes in sufficient detail the facts and legal arguments underpinning its case in order to commence settlement discussions. Therein, the Claimant requested Slovakia to engage in negotiations to amicably settle the dispute, further adding that it reserved its right to resort to arbitration if the Parties failed to settle their dispute within six months.582 The Parties thereafter exchanged numerous communications between February and April 2021 but failed to amicably resolve their dispute.583\n\nNotice of Dispute, 2 October 2020, paras. 77-79 (C-26).\n\nLetter of 17 February 2021 from Signature Litigation LLP to Slovakia (C-400); Email of 18 February 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-401); Email of 24 February 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-402); Letter of 8 March 2021 from Signature Litigation LLP to Slovakia (C-403); Email of 9 March 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-404); Email of 12 March 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-405); Email of 16 March 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-406); Letter of 16 March 2021 from Signature Litigation LLP to Slovakia (C-407); Email of 23 March 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-408); Email of 24 March 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-409); Letter of 24 March 2021 from Signature Litigation LLP to Slovakia (C-410); Letter of 2 April 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-411); Email of 21 April 2021 from Slovakia to Signature Litigation LLP (C-412); Letter of 21 April 2021 from Signature Litigation LLP to Slovakia (C-413).\n\n356.\n\nAs noted in *Murphy v. Ecuador*, \"the obligation to negotiate is an obligation of means, not of results\", such that \"there is no obligation to reach, but rather to try to reach, an agreement\".584 Here, it cannot be denied, on the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal, that the Claimant sought to enter into negotiations with the Respondent during the six-month cooling-off period and that the Parties failed to reach an agreement. Accordingly, the Claimant complied with the requirements in Article VI(2) of the BIT and the Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's objection to the contrary.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador I*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2010, para. 135 (RL-49).\n\n**7. Do the claims relate to measures taken to maintain public order under Article X(1) of the BIT?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent invokes Article X(1) of the BIT to argue that Discovery cannot invoke the BIT's substantive obligations, since the claims arise out of measures taken to maintain public order and to protect Slovakia's essential security interests. Specifically, the Respondent contends that the disputed measures were intended to prevent \"civil unrest\" and to protect the \"environment and drinking water\".585\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 239-245.\n\n358.\n\nThe Claimant answers that Slovakia's reliance on Article X(1) of the BIT is \"misconceived\", since this provision does \"not give rise to a jurisdictional objection\", but functions as a defense on liability.586\n\nReply, paras. 218-219.\n\n359.\n\nIn any event, Slovakia failed to produce contemporaneous evidence showing that the disputed measures were necessary. The protests at Smilno did not amount to \"mass public unrest\" and concerned only a \"handful of activists\".587 In fact, the behavior of the police and the State prosecutor only exacerbated the activists' \"illegal behavior\".588 As regards Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, the MoA's refusal to approve the Lease Amendment was not necessary to maintain public order or protect an essential security interest.589\n\nReply, para. 226(3).\n\nReply, para. 226(3).\n\nReply, para. 226(4).\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n360.\n\nArticle X(1) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests\".590\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article X(1) (C-1).\n\n361.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raised the objection in relation to Article X(1) of the BIT as part of its overall objection that the Claimant failed to make a protected investment. The Claimant answered that Article X(1) had no bearing on the issue of jurisdiction and that it would only operate as a defense to liability \"because the substantive obligations owed by Slovakia to Discovery under the BIT will not apply\".591 Notably, the Respondent did not respond in its Rejoinder or at the Hearing to the Claimant's argument and it did not further elaborate on this objection. The Tribunal therefore understands that the Respondent does not object to the Claimant's argument and that it no longer maintains its objection.\n\nReply, para. 219.\n\n362.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that Article X(1) has no bearing on the question of whether the Claimant made a protected investment under the BIT and that it therefore does not go to jurisdiction but to liability. Article X(1) of the BIT does not provide any further element to the question of whether the Claimant made a protected investment and would only allow the Respondent to avoid liability if the conditions mentioned in that provision are met. In other words, if it can be shown that any measure adopted by the Slovak Republic was necessary to maintain public order or to protect an essential security interest, the consequence would be that the Respondent could avoid liability for such measure since the substantive protections in the BIT would not apply.\n\n363.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's preliminary objection based on Article X(1) of the BIT.\n\n**8. Are the discrimination claims outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction or otherwise inadmissible under the carve-out in the Annex of the BIT?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent finally invokes the carve-outs in the Annex of the BIT, as amended by Article IV of the Additional Protocol, in relation to \"ownership of real property\" and \"hydrocarbons\" to argue that Discovery's claims of discriminatory treatment are \"inadmissible or otherwise outside this Tribunal's jurisdiction\".592\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 246-248.\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimant responds that Slovakia cannot rely on the exceptions listed in the Annex of the BIT in relation to \"ownership of real property\" and \"hydrocarbons\", since it failed to notify the US, either before or after the BIT's entry into force, of a derogation to the obligation of national treatment under Article II(1) of the BIT.593 Moreover, Slovakia failed to show that the disputed measures were necessary to comply with EU law, as required under the Additional Protocol amending the Annex. In fact, both Slovakia's and the EU's policy has always been to diversify energy supplies and improve energy security.594\n\nReply, paras. 228-229.\n\nReply, para. 233.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n366.\n\nHere again, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not pursue or elaborate on this objection after receiving the Reply. It therefore understands that the Respondent does not maintain its objection.\n\n367.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant rightly points out that Article II(1) of the BIT required the Slovak Republic to notify the United States of America of any exceptions relating to the hydrocarbons sector.595 The Respondent did not challenge the Claimant's affirmation that the Slovak Republic never notified any such exceptions. Accordingly, the Respondent did not sufficiently establish that any exceptions in relation to the hydrocarbons sector apply in the present case.\n\nArticle II(1) of the BIT reads as follows: \"Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a nondiscriminatory basis, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of entry into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Annex. Moreover, each Party agrees to notify the other of any future exception with respect to the sectors or matters listed in the Annex, and to limit such exceptions to a minimum. Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, except as stated otherwise in the Annex, be not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies of any third country\". US-Slovakia BIT, Article II(1) (C-1).\n\n368.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal cannot but dismiss the Respondent's preliminary objection based on the Annex of the BIT.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n369.\n\nHaving rejected all of the Respondent's preliminary objections, the Tribunal now turns to assess the merits of the claims.\n\n**C. Liability**\n----------------\n\n**1. Introductory remarks**\n---------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant challenges 14 measures that, it says, allegedly prevented AOG from conducting its drilling operations in the Slovak Republic, and in particular at the Smilno and Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka sites.\n\n371.\n\nThe dispute about Smilno mainly concerns AOG's difficulties in gaining access to the drill site Smilno-1. It involves the following measures:\n\n\u2022 Local police refused to acknowledge that the Access Road was publicly accessible and to remove activists or their vehicles that were blocking that road (Measure # 1);\n\n\u2022 The police refused to approve a road signage scheme acknowledging that the Access Road was a public road or a PSPR (Measure # 6);\n\n\u2022 The judiciary improperly granted and upheld an interim injunction preventing AOG from using the Access Road (Measures ## 2-3);\n\n\u2022 The district prosecutor, Dr. Slosar\u010dikov\u00e1 improperly intervened at the Smilno site and instructed the police to stop its operations (Measures ## 4-5);\n\n\u2022 The Ministry of Interior improperly instructed the police that the Access Road was a private road (Measure # 7); and\n\n\u2022 The Bardejov District Office ordered that AOG perform a full EIA for its planned exploratory well (Measure # 11).\n\n372.\n\nAs regards Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka, the Claimant complains about the following measures:\n\n\u2022 The MoA refused to approve the Lease Amendment (Measure # 8);\n\n\u2022 The MoE first refused to grant a compulsory access order pursuant to Article 29 of the Geology Act (Measure # 9);\n\n\u2022 After that decision had been quashed, the MoE improperly suspended the Article 29 proceedings (Measure # 10); and\n\n\u2022 The Medzilaborce district office required AOG to carry out a full EIA for its well at Kriv\u00e1 Olka (Measure # 12).\n\n373.\n\nIn respect of Ruska Poruba, the Claimant complains that the Humenne district office required AOG to carry out a full EIA for its proposed well (Measure # 13).\n\n374.\n\nFinally, the Claimant complains that the MoE imposed the performance of a preliminary EIA for all future wells (Measure # 14).\n\n375.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Claimant provided a helpful table that summarized the 14 disputed measures:596\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Police | Judiciary | Prosecutor | MoI | MoA | MoE | District Offices |\n| Smilno | MEASURE #1: Refused to acknowledge that the Road was a public road and refused to remove activists' vehicles | MEASURE #2: Granted the Interim Injunction which prevented AOG from using the Road | MEASURE #4: Intervened in AOG's civil dispute with Ms Varjanov\u00e1 concerning the Interim Injunction | MEASURE #7: Instructed the Police that the Road was private land, not a public road |  |  |  |\n|  | MEASURE #6: Refused to approve signage acknowledging that the Road was a public road | MEASURE #3: Refused to overturn the Interim Injunction following AOG's appeal | MEASURE #5: Instructed the Police to cancel their policing operation at Smilno |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  | MEASURE #8: Refused to approve the Amendment to the Lease under Article 50(7) of the Forests Act | MEASURE #9: Refused to grant a Compulsory Access Order under Article 29 of the Geology Act |  |\n| Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka |  |  |  |  | MEASURE #10: Suspended the Article 29 proceedings pending resolution of the \"preliminary issue\" |  |\n| EIA |  |  |  |  | MEASURE #14: Imposed the EIA Condition | MEASURES #11- 13 Issued the EIA Decisions |\n\nClaimant's Demonstrative Exhibit 2 (CD-2). See also Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 52, 144.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's conduct in connection with the impugned measures violated the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT (Section 3 below), was arbitrary and discriminatory in breach of Article II(1) and II(2)(b) of the BIT (Section 4 below), failed to provide effective means in violation of Article II(6) of the BIT (Section 5 below), and was expropriatory in breach of Article III(1) of the BIT (Section 6 below). The Tribunal will address these claims in turn after having dealt with attribution (Section 2 below).\n\n377.\n\nBefore going into detailed analysis and discussion of these matters, it may be useful to stress why in essence, and on the basis of a birds-eye view of the evidence before it, the Tribunal entertains significant doubts overall about the basis of the claims, as they are presented.\n\n378.\n\nAt Smilno, the dispute boils down to AOG's failure to secure the right to use the field track leading to its drill site, the so-called Access Road. The Claimant's case hinges on its argument that, under Slovak law, the Access Road was a type of road that AOG was entitled to use. The evidence before the Tribunal, however, suggests that the Access Road was a private track and not a public road, and one which AOG could not use without the consent of the owners or a ministerial order from the MoE. However, rather than obtaining such consent, the evidence indicates that AOG resorted to self-help, circumvented an interim injunction adopted by the local courts, and generally conducted itself in a manner that, it seems to the Tribunal, needlessly antagonized the local residents. Ultimately, AOG agreed with local activists to undergo a preliminary EIA in exchange for the activists' undertaking to stop their opposition. When the district office reviewed the preliminary EIA application, it determined that AOG needed to conduct a full EIA. Whatever it may have believed to be the legal reality, AOG chose not to appeal that decision and then abandoned the exploration.\n\n379.\n\nThe cause for the failure at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka is different. It primarily lies in AOG's legal mistakes and problematic decision-making process. The evidence indicates that AOG did not seek an amendment of the Lease for the site in good time. Then, AOG refused to attempt to obtain a new lease when the MoE asked for it in the context of its Article 29 Application. Finally, although it agreed to subject itself to a preliminary EIA, AOG abandoned its drilling program after the district office imposed the obligation to conduct a full EIA, again without resorting to available remedies.\n\n380.\n\nWhile Discovery and AOG faced a number of setbacks in their operations, the record suggests that it was not immediately apparent that these could be said to be the responsibility of the State, or could on their face be said to rise to the level of a treaty breach. Testimony at the Hearing rather showed that State officials sought to accommodate and support AOG, on the one hand, and at the same time to consider the views expressed by the local population and environmental and climate change activists, on the other. In the end, the record suggests that, confronted with a project that did not run as smoothly as it may have expected and certainly hoped, Discovery decided not to pursue its efforts mainly due to financial constraints.597\n\nMr. Lewis told his JV Partners in October 2017 that he had no more \"horsepower or appetite\" and refused to invest more funds in the enterprise (Opcom Minutes, 3 October 2017, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-382)). Moreover, Discovery was unable to secure additional funding for the project, notwithstanding the fact that it told potential investors in October 2017 that they would invest in a \"[l]ow-cost, low-risk\" project (Discovery Global, LLC: Exploration and appraisal in Slovakia, Investor introduction, October 2017, pp. 3 and 11 (C-180)). For instance, potential investors, such as Cadogan Petroleum, required 3D seismic surveys that AOG had planned in 2014 but never acquired (Email of 25 August 2017 from A. Fraser to G. [REDACTED] (R-198) and Opcom minutes, 11 September 2014, pp. 4-5 of the pdf document (C-61)). Similarly, another potential investor, Claren Energy Corporation, required additional data and ultimately decided not to invest in the project (Letter of Intent from Mr. Lewis to Claren, 15 November 2017 (R-199)).\n\n381.\n\nAll of these questions are addressed in greater detail below.\n\n**2. Attribution**\n------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the \"focus\" of the claims is \"the actions of private activists\" and the State's \"allegedly deficient response\" to those private actions.598 For the Respondent, \"[n]one of the activists' conduct\" is attributable to the State, whether under Articles 4 or 8 of the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission on the Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (the \"ILC Articles\").599 Specifically, the activists are not organs of the State, nor did they act on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of the State.600\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 263.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 263-271.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 265.\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimant clarifies that it does not impugn the conduct of the activists. Its claims arise from conduct \u2013 whether action or inaction \u2013 of State organs, namely the police, the Smilno mayor, the \u00daGKK, the judiciary, a State prosecutor, the MoT, the MoI, the MoE and three district offices.601 It cannot be disputed, and as discussed below it is not disputed, that the conduct of those entities is attributable to the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.602\n\nReply, para. 253.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 263-271; Reply, paras. 253 and 255(4). See also Rejoinder, note 476 and para. 421.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n384.\n\nAs noted, this dispute refers to the conduct of the police, the district offices, the prosecutor's office, the judiciary and various ministries. The Claimant does not complain about the conduct of the activists or other private persons.603\n\nTr. (Day 6), 13:6-9 (Tushingham) (\"Our complaint is not about the conduct of the activists. Our complaint is about the conduct of the state in making decisions that prevented us from doing the work. So that's the point\").\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent rightly accepts that the bodies listed in the previous paragraph are State organs, whose actions are attributable to the Slovak Republic under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.604\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries*, in Yearbook of International Law Commission, 2001, Vol. II, Part Two, p. 40, Article 4 (CL-54).\n\n386.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Claimant claimed that the statements of Mr. Baran, the mayor of Smilno, were also attributable to the Slovak Republic.605 There appears to be no dispute that the mayor of Smilno is part of the Slovak State apparatus and that his conduct as mayor (rather in his capacity as a private citizen) can be attributed to the Slovak Republic under Article 4. That said, the Claimant does not complain about the conduct of the mayor of Smilno, it merely relies on his contemporaneous statements to argue that other State organs acted inconsistently with those statements.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 26:15-28:3 (Tushingham).\n\n387.\n\nIn brief, the acts which Discovery challenges are all attributable to the Slovak Republic.\n\n**3. Fair and equitable treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**i. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n388.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's conduct breached the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT on multiple counts.606 More particularly, by preventing AOG from implementing its exploration program, the Slovak Republic breached Discovery's legitimate expectations, acted inconsistently, arbitrarily and discriminatorily, and denied justice.\n\nMemorial, paras. 209-238; Reply, paras. 256-348, Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 156-165.\n\n389.\n\nIn respect of **Smilno**, the Claimant argues that (i) the local police refused to acknowledge that the Access Road was a public road and remove activists blocking that road, (ii) the judiciary wrongfully granted the Interim Injunction which prevented AOG from using the Access Road and thereafter refused to overturn that decision on appeal, (iii) the prosecutor wrongfully intervened in AOG's dispute with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 and instructed the police to cancel the policing operation at Smilno, and (iv) the MoI wrongfully instructed the police that the Access Road was a private road.607\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentations, Slide 144, measures 1-6.\n\n390.\n\nAs regards **Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka**, the Claimant asserts that (i) the MoA wrongfully refused to approve the Lease Amendment under Article 50(7) of the Forests Act, (ii) the MoE wrongfully refused to grant a compulsory access order under Article 29(4) of the Geology Act and (iii) wrongfully suspended the Article 29 proceedings to resolve a \"preliminary issue\".608\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentations, Slide 144, measures 8-10.\n\n391.\n\nFinally, in connection with the **EIA** procedure, the Claimant argues that (i) the district offices wrongfully decided that AOG would have to conduct a full EIA for its exploratory drilling at Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Ruska Poruba and (ii) the MoE wrongfully imposed the obligation to perform a preliminary EIA for all future wells.609\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentations, Slide 144, measures 11-14.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe Respondent disputes having breached the FET standard,610 and submits that it neither frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations,611 nor acted inconsistently612 or arbitrarily,613 nor denied justice to Discovery or AOG.614\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 272-373; Rejoinder, paras. 250-491; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 169-183.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 294-344; Rejoinder, paras. 257-398.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 345-355; Rejoinder, paras. 399-426.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 427-473.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 356-373; Rejoinder, paras. 474-491.\n\n393.\n\nAs for **Smilno**, the Respondent contends that Discovery was unable to proceed with its exploration program as a result of AOG's legal mistakes and failure to obtain land owner consent to use the Access Road.615 The Claimant's PSPR arguement would be an \"after-the-fact\" invention on which its entire case is built when in reality the Access Road is a private road.616\n\nRejoinder, para. 289.\n\nRejoinder, para. 291.\n\n394.\n\nComing to **Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka**, Slovakia states that AOG's legal mistakes, not the State's conduct, prevented the drilling. The MoA could not approve the Lease Amendment, because AOG's request was late and the Lease had expired by the time the MoA received the extension request.617 The Respondent further disputes that the MoE refused to issue a compulsory access order due to an instruction from the highest levels of the ministry and adds that the first instance decision was in any event overturned on appeal by Minister S\u00f3lymos.618 AOG then stopped participating in the Article 29 proceedings and refused to seek to obtain a new lease from LSR.619\n\nRejoinder, para. 339.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 357-360.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 361-366.\n\n395.\n\nFinally, on the **EIA** process, the Respondent argues that AOG voluntarily agreed to undergo preliminary EIAs and thus could not expect that the district offices would refrain from processing the preliminary EIA applications or that the preliminary EIAs would not progress to full EIAs.620 It further notes that the Claimant is wrong arguing that the EIA Amendment would not apply to drilling operations starting after 1 January 2017.621 It finally disputes that the EIA Decisions of the district offices breached the FET standard and adds that, in any event, AOG could have appealed the Smilno and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka EIA decisions, as it successfully did in respect of Ruska Poruba, but rather chose to abandon its operations altogether.622\n\nRejoinder, paras. 368 and 371-374.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 375-390.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 369 and 391-398.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**i. Legal standard**\n---------------------\n\n396.\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that which conforms to principles of international law\".623\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article II(2)(a) (C-1).\n\n397.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article II(2)(a) contains an \"autonomous\" FET standard,624 whereas the Respondent contends that the FET standard is limited to the MST.625\n\nReply, paras. 257-265; Tr.

Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award, 19 September 2013 (herein after \"*ECE v. Czech Republic*\"), para. 4.764 (RL-92).\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal must interpret Article II(2)(a) of the BIT according to the rules codified in Article 31 of the VCLT.630 Accordingly, the meaning of Article II(2)(a) must primarily be ascertained based on the ordinary meaning of the words used, in their context, and in the light of the BIT's object and purpose.631\n\nCzechoslovakia acceded to the VCLT on 29 July 1987 and, as successor State, the Slovak Republic became a party to the VCLT on 28 May 1993. In any event, the Slovak Republic accepts that the VCLT codifies the rules of treaty interpretation under customary international law. See Counter-Memorial, para. 275; United Nations Treaty Collection, Chapter XXIII \"Law of Treaties\", Section 1 \"Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\", Vienna, 23 May 1969, at https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg\\_no=XXIII-1&chapter=23&Temp=mtdsg3&clang=\\_en#5.\n\n*Quiborax v. Bolivia*, para. 212; *KT Asia Investment v. Kazakhstan*, para. 165.\n\n401.\n\nStarting with the text of the provision, Article II(2)(a) contains three components: an investment \"shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment\"; such investment \"shall enjoy full protection and security\"; and such investment \"shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that which conforms to principles of international law\".\n\n402.\n\nWhile only the first and third elements are relevant for present purposes, the second plays a role in understanding the structure of the sentence. Indeed, the three components appear to be freestanding and disconnected, as is shown by the comma between the first two elements and from the conjunction \"and\" before the third. The repeated use of the word \"shall\" further confirms that each component is intended to exist as a distinct and separate obligation. Importantly, there is no textual link between the first and third components suggesting that the Contracting States must accord fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of international law or that the FET standard is equivalent to (or coterminous with) requirements under principles of international law. Rather, the words and their sequence seem to indicate that the third element is a floor as opposed to a ceiling.632\n\nThe Tribunal shares the view expressed in that regard in *Azurix v. Argentina*. See *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, para. 361 (RL-60). See also *LSG Building Solutions GmbH et al. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Principles of Reparation, 11 July 2022 (hereinafter \"*LSG v. Romania*\"), para. 1019 (CL-98).\n\n403.\n\nIn sum, nothing in Article II(2)(a) suggests that the FET standard equates to the MST. The Respondent's reference to NAFTA Article 1105(1), which was adopted at around the same time is unavailing. NAFTA Article 1105 is expressly entitled \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\", no such mention is made in Article II(2)(a). Construing Article II(2)(a) as being limited to the MST would imply reading language into that provision that it does not contain.\n\n404.\n\nNeither does the language of Article II(2)(a), on its face, appear to restrict FET to a customary international law standard. As noted in *Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica*, the words \"principles of international law\" refer to a broader category of sources than custom633 and may include general principles emanating from domestic law, and transposed on the international plane as well as general principles emerging directly on the international level, including from treaties, case law of international courts and tribunals or custom.634 This understanding is consistent with *Vivendi II v. Argentina*, where the tribunal saw \"no basis for equating principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment\", and held that \"the reference to principles of international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard\".635\n\n*Infinito Gold Ltd. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5, Award, 3 June 2021 (hereinafter \"*Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica*\"), para. 332 (CL-15).\n\n*Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica*, paras. 332-333 (CL-15).\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, para. 7.4.7 (CL-19).\n\n405.\n\nThe context surrounding Article II(2)(a) does not support a limitation to the MST either. The preamble of the BIT expresses the Contracting Parties' agreement that \"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources\". Nothing in this wording points to a limitation of \"fair and equitable treatment of investment\" to the MST.\n\n406.\n\nArticle III(1) allows the expropriation or nationalization of foreign investments *inter alia* under the condition that such expropriation or nationalization occur \"in accordance with the *general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2)*\" (emphasis added). The reference to the \"general principles of treatment\" provided in Article II(2), as opposed to \"principles of international law\", reinforces the view that each of the three components of Article II(1)(a) qualifies as a distinct principle of treatment.\n\n407.\n\nFurthermore, there is no contemporaneous instrument in the sense of Article 31(2) VCLT, subsequent practice in the meaning of Article 31(3)(a)-(b), or rule of international law applicable between the Contracting Parties in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) that would buttress the Respondent's interpretation. The reliance on the US Model BIT and the joint statement of the NAFTA Contracting States is inapposite in light of the BIT's actual wording. The same is true of the argument that, being part of customary international law, the MST is a relevant rule of international law to be considered under Article 31(3)(c). While this argument might arguably give content to the third component in Article II(2)(a), it does not assist in determining whether the FET standard is autonomous or not.\n\n408.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal may turn to the BIT's object and purpose. Other than the mention of FET in the preamble, there is nothing in the BIT's object and purpose that would point to one interpretation rather than another. As a general matter, the object of an investment treaty is to promote investment to further a State's development and at the same time to protect foreign investors.636 Here, the preamble states that the US and the Slovak Republic seek to \"promote greater economic cooperation\", to stimulate economic development through the flow of private capital, to maintain a stable investment framework to ensure the \"maximum effective utilization of economic resources\", and to raise \"living standards and the quality of life\" of their populations.637 In other words, the preamble refers to both private interests of the investor and public interests of the State. Those objectives counterbalance each other, with the consequence that the object and purpose of the BIT \u2013 as reflected in the preamble \u2013 may be said to be neutral for present purposes and does not tilt the balance either way.638\n\nSee, for instance, *El Paso Energy v. Argentina*, para. 369 (CL-25) and Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, para. 70.\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Preamble (C-1).\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 158; *Churchill Mining Plc v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICISD Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 February 2014, para. 178.\n\n409.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) is an autonomous treaty standard that is not limited to customary international law in general or the MST in particular.\n\n410.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by numerous arbitral awards holding that the FET standard can only be equated to the MST if the treaty in question explicitly or implicitly so states.639 At the same time, the Tribunal is mindful that some tribunals interpreting provisions similar to Article II(2) reached a different outcome. In particular, the *El Paso* tribunal found \"that the position according to which FET is equivalent to the international minimum standard is more in line with the evolution of investment law and international law and with the identical role assigned to FET and to the international minimum standard\".640\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v.

Argentina*, para. 336 (CL-25).\n\n411.\n\nThe relevant treaty provision in *El Paso* was slightly different from the one at stake here, in that it spoke of treatment no less than that required by international law.641 In addition and more importantly, in its analysis the *El Paso* tribunal did not refer to the VCLT (at least not explicitly). It referred to three divergent approaches adopted by investment tribunals: the first equating FET with the MST; the second dealing with FET as an autonomous concept; and the third taking an \"intermediate, undecided position\".642 The tribunal then sided with the first opinion because of the \"identical role assigned to FET and to the international minimum standard\".643 It then concluded that the \"true question\" was not to compare \"two undefined or weakly defined standards\", but to \"ascertain the content and define the BIT standard of fair and equitable treatment\".644\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT reads as follows: \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law\". See *El Paso Energy v. Argentina*, para. 326 (CL-25).\n\n*El Paso Energy v. Argentina*, paras. 331-334 (CL-25).\n\n*El Paso Energy v. Argentina*, para. 336 (CL-25).\n\n*El Paso Energy v. Argentina*, para. 335 (CL-25).\n\n**(b) The content of the FET standard**\n---------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the FET standard of the BIT encompasses several \"core protections\": the protection of legitimate expectations, the prohibition of inconsistent, arbitrary, discriminatory and non-transparent conduct, as well as the prohibition of procedural and substantive denial of justice.645\n\nMemorial, para. 213; Tr. (Day 1), 76:22-77:3 (Tushingham).\n\n413.\n\nSave with respect to substantive denial of justice, the Respondent largely agrees. With respect to legitimate expectations, it says FET protects legitimate expectations \"based on *(i)* specific assurances, *(ii)* given by the host State *(iii) at the time the investment was made* and *(iv) relied on by the investor* in making that investment\".646 Moreover, on its view, an assurance must have a precise content, be specifically addressed to the investor, and be legitimate and reasonable.647\n\nEmphasis in the original. Counter-Memorial, paras. 294-295.\n\nRejoinder, para. 257.\n\n414.\n\nAs noted in many awards, the interpretation of the treaty terms \"fair and equitable\" yields limited results, such that the contours of the FET standard have progressively been elucidated through arbitral and judicial decisions. While precise formulas may vary, a consensus has emerged that FET may cover the protection of legitimate expectations, the protection against conduct that is arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and lacking in good faith, the principle of due process and protection against denial of justice.648\n\n*Deutsche Telekom AG v.

Romania*, para. 1022 (CL-98).\n\n415.\n\nRegarding legitimate expectations, it appears settled that such expectations may arise where there is evidence that the State has given clear and specific assurances to an investor, and that the investor has relied on these assurances before it has made the investment.649 In the words of *Antaris v. Czech Republic*:\n\n\"A claimant must establish that (a) clear and explicit (or implicit) representations were made by or attributable to the state in order to induce the investment, (b) such representations were reasonably relied upon by the Claimants, and (c) these representations were subsequently repudiated by the state\".650\n\n*Crystallex International v.

Slovak Republic* held as follows:\n\n\"To qualify as legitimate, the investor's expectations must be based on assurances (i) given by the State in order to encourage the making of the investment; (ii) addressed specifically to the investor; and (iii) that are sufficiently specific in content. In addition, an investor must establish that it placed reliance upon the assurance\".651\n\n*Muszynianka sp\u00f3\u0142ka v. Slovak Republic*, para. 462 (RL-65).\n\n417.\n\nThe *LSG v. Romania* tribunal emphasized that expectations must be assessed objectively by reference to a prudent investor in the circumstances prevailing at the time of the making of the investment.652 That tribunal also emphasized that the legitimacy or reasonableness of the expectations must be assessed in conjunction with other elements, including \"the investor's own conduct, and the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions in the host State\".653 As part of the investor's conduct, many tribunals have insisted on the need for evidence that the investor engaged in a meaningful exercise of due diligence.654\n\n*LSG v.

[\u2026] It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety\".655\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1989*, para. 128.\n\n419.\n\nFET also requires that the State's conduct be reasonable, proportionate and in conformity with due process. A measure is reasonable if it pursues a rational policy for a legitimate public purpose.656 That assessment may include a review of the consistency of the State's conduct.657 A measure is proportionate if it is necessary and suitable to achieve a legitimate public purpose, and it does not appear excessive when weighing the interests at stake.658 Various arbitral tribunals have also held that FET may include a transparency element.659 Here, Article II(7) of the BIT specifically requires the Contracting States to \"make available to the public all laws, regulations, administrative practices and procedures, and adjudicatory decisions that pertain to or affect investments\".660\n\n*Muszynianka sp\u00f3\u0142ka v.

The following elements can lead to this conclusion (i) the State has denied the investor access to domestic courts; (ii) the courts have engaged in unwarranted delay; (iii) the courts have failed to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice (such as the independence and impartiality of judges, due process and the right to be heard); or (iv) the decision is manifestly arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic. The Tribunal thus concludes that a denial of justice may be procedural or substantive, and that in both situations the denial of justice is the product of a systemic failure of the host State's judiciary taken as a whole. The latter point explains that a claim for denial of justice presupposes the exhaustion of local remedies [\u2026]\".661\n\n*Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica*, para. 445 (CL-15).\n\n421.\n\nThis is the place to note that the judiciary \u2013 as a State organ \u2013 may be found to breach FET by means of acts other than denial of justice. As stated by the majority in *Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica,* \"there is no principled reason to limit the State's responsibility for judicial decisions to instances of denial of justice\". Indeed, \"[h]olding otherwise would mean that part of the State's activity would not trigger liability even though it would be contrary to the standards protected under the investment treaty\".662\n\n*Infinito Gold v.

Legitimate expectations**\n-------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent frustrated its legitimate expectations to conduct its exploration program at Smilno (a) and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka (b). It further complains that its legitimate expectations were deceived when the Slovak Republic required AOG to carry out a full EIA for pre-2017 drills at Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba and, more generally, when it imposed an obligation to conduct preliminary EIAs for all post-2017 drills (c).\n\n**(a) Smilno**\n--------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Claimant's case is that the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License and its renewals contained assurances that AOG would be permitted to carry out its exploration activities, including drilling up to 1,500 meters, which gave rise to legitimate expectations that were deceived.663 Discovery emphasizes in this context that the Exploration License \"imposed an express obligation upon AOG\" to conduct its exploration program.664 However, various \"organs and agents\" of the Slovak State, including the police, the judiciary, a prosecutor and the MoI prevented AOG from performing its program.665\n\nMemorial, paras. 78-129 and 224-231; Reply, paras. 22, 53-115 and 268-298; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 37, 50, 52-86 and 158.\n\nReply, paras. 19 and 22. In the words of the Claimant, it expected (i) that AOG would \"not be prevented from completing the geological exploration that it was permitted to conduct under the terms of the Licences\" and (ii) would \"be able to complete the necessary geological exploration works\", (iii) that exploration at Smilno would be permissible, and (iv) that such exploration \"could be carried out without any other relevant organ of the Slovak State objecting to such exploration so that no other organ would prevent the exploration\" (emphasis omitted). Memorial, para. 226.\n\nAlthough the Claimant argued in its Memorial that the Parliament of the Pre\u0161ov region also prevented AOG from drilling at Smilno, it did not maintain this argument in subsequent pleadings.

It will then assess the status of the Access Road (Section (ii)) in order to determine whether the Respondent's conduct frustrated Discovery's expectations and thus breached the FET standard (Section (iii)).\n\n**(i) The regulatory framework and the Exploration License did not generate legitimate expectations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n427.\n\nIt is Discovery's submission that the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License, including the July 2014 and June 2016 renewals, and the Geology Act generated the legitimate expectation that AOG would be allowed to drill at the Smilno site and that the Slovak authorities would not prevent it from accessing that site.670 That expectation was based, it argues, \"on the clear and implicit representation\" made in the licenses \"when read together with the Geology Act\".671 These were said to impose on the State an \"express obligation\" to allow the conduct of exploration activities.672 For the Claimant, \"[t]his was the quid pro quo of AOG's obligation to [\u2026] do the work\".673\n\nTr.

Slovak Republic*, para. 473 (RL-65).\n\n429.\n\nRegarding expectations based on the grant of an exploration license and its renewals, the Tribunal sees no reason why an exploration license could not, in certain circumstances and depending on the particular evidence, be found to contain specific representations or assurances upon which an investor may have legitimately relied in deciding to make or add to an investment. In the present case, however, neither the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License nor its renewals contain any specific representation that Discovery and AOG would be able to drill at the Smilno site. This is even more apparent if the license is read in conjunction with the Geology Act, a measure of general application which by its very nature cannot be said to be addressed to a specific investor. That legislation manifestly does not, and cannot be said to be, of the nature of giving any specific or clear assurance to a specific investor with regard to a specific site.\n\n430.\n\nThe Svidn\u00edk Exploration License determined the extent of the exploration area and the conditions which the license holder had to meet while conducting exploration activities. Under the terms of the initial license dated 18 July 2006, AOG could perform geological works to explore for \"oil and flammable natural gas\" within a period of four years and in a specified area covering 760.1 km\u00b2.676 The 2006 license was extended in July 2010, July 2014 and June 2016.677 Although the license and its renewals employ the mandatory \"shall\" to impose various obligations on AOG, for instance, to \"carry out geological works\" and report on a yearly basis,678 it does not follow that the State gave the assurance that it could drill or exploit at the Smilno site. At best, Discovery could expect to drill at that site provided it complied with the license conditions and applicable laws. It is true that the 2016 renewal mentions the drilling of \"at least two (2) vertical or diverted holes up to 1,500 m deep\", as well as short term and protracted pumping tests and additional geophysical surveys.679 However, it is uncontroverted that drilling exploratory wells was already part of AOG's exploration program under the initial license.\n\nDecision on determination of exploration area (Svidn\u00edk), 18 July 2006, p. 1 (C-2 and R-14).\n\nDecision about extension of the geological survey permit (Svidn\u00edk), Ref.

It is true that the 2016 renewal mentions the drilling of \"at least two (2) vertical or diverted holes up to 1,500 m deep\", as well as short term and protracted pumping tests and additional geophysical surveys (Decision modifying the size of the area, and extending the validity term for the exploration area, Record No.: 33507/2016, Dossier No.: 5021/2016-7.3 (Svidn\u00edk), 14 June 2016, p. 6 of the pdf document (C-12)). However, it is uncontroverted that drilling exploratory wells was already part of AOG's exploration program under the initial license such that this inclusion does contain any new assurance or representation. Moreover, the 2016 renewal postdates in any event Discovery's decision to invest in Slovakia and thus cannot be the basis of any legitimate expectation.\n\nDecision modifying the size of the area and extending the validity term for the exploration area, Record No.: 33507/2016, Dossier No.: 5021/2016-7.3 (Svidn\u00edk), 14 June 2016, p. 6 of the pdf document (C-12).\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore of the view that the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License and its renewals could not give rise to the legitimate expectations that Discovery claims to have formed. Accordingly, the legitimate expectation claim fails for that reason alone. For completeness and because the Parties have extensively debated this issue, the Tribunal will nevertheless pursue the analysis assuming for purposes of discussion only that Discovery could have expected to drill at Smilno if it complied with the license conditions and the law.\n\n432.\n\nThe 2006 license contained 42 \"[c]onditions for carrying out geological works\", of which it is useful to recite the following:\n\n\"The Exploration Area Holder shall:\n\n1. carry out geological works in accordance with the project of the geological task, which must be prepared in accordance with the Geology Act and other legislation\n\n2. pursuant to Article 14 of the Geology Act, prepare a final report and, pursuant to Article 16(2) of the Geology Act, submit a separate part of the final report with the calculation of reserves to the Ministry for review and approval\n\n3. pursuant to Article 17 of the Geology Act, submit the approved final report to the Dion\u00fdz \u0160t\u00far State Geological Institute Bratislava [\u2026]\n\n4. pursuant to Article 22(1) of the Geology Act, submit an annual report on exploration activities to the Ministry, indicating the results of the selected geological works and the funds spent on exploration within six weeks of the end of the calendar year\n\n5. when carrying out geological works, it shall comply with the requirements of nature and landscapes protection pursuant to Act No. 543/2002 Coll. on the Protection of Nature and Landscapes, as amended\n\n6. submit the project of the geological task (the technical part of the project) to the Regional Environmental Office Pre\u0161ov for an opinion pursuant to Article 9(1)(n) of the Act No. 543/2002 Coll. on the Protection of Nature and Landscapes\n\n7. in the case of the implementation of geological works in protected areas with 2nd and 3rd degree of protection, it will proceed pursuant to Article 13(2)(f) and Article 14(2)(f) of the Act No. 543/2002 Coll. on the Protection of Nature and Landscapes, as amended\n\n8. not carry out geological works in the 4th or 5th degree of protection, in justified cases the competent nature protection authority may grant an exemption from the prohibitions pursuant to the Act No. 543/2002 Coll. on the Protection of Nature and Landscapes, as amended\n\n9. when carrying out geological works in the area with the first degree of protection, proceed in such a way as not to interfere with wetlands and the greenery by waterways\n\n[\u2026]\".680\n\nMoreover, under conditions not listed above, AOG was, for instance, restricted from exploring in \"inner spa areas\", had to \"proceed in such a way as to ensure all-round protection of surface water and groundwater\", could not carry out exploration activities \"outside the protection zones of the roads of II. and III. class\", and had to \"implement geological works so as not to damage the construction and surface of roads of II. and III. class\". Decision on determination of exploration area (Svidn\u00edk), 18 July 2006, pp. 5-7, items 1-9, 18, 25, 32, 34 and 37 (R-14).\n\n433.\n\nThe 2010 extension contained a list of 30 conditions with which Aurelian had to comply, some of them overlapping with the conditions listed in the 2006 license and others being added, such as the obligation to \"proceed according to \u00a7 29 Geology Act, when entering land plots\".681 The July 2014 extension listed no conditions, but the Claimant did not argue and there is no reason to understand that the conditions as at the 2010 extension ceased to apply. The June 2016 extension, by contrast, expressly required AOG to comply with the conditions of the initial 2006 license and subsequent extensions.682\n\nDecision about extension of the geological survey permit (Svidn\u00edk), Ref. No.: 44505/2010, File No.: 998/2010- 9.3, 26 July 2010, p. 7 of the pdf document, para. 2.6 (C-5).\n\n\"The holder of exploration area will be required to abide by the terms and conditions set out in the Decision granting the Svidn\u00edk Exploration Area, as later amended by subsequent Decisions\".

While paragraph 1 of Article 29 entitles a license holder and authorized persons \"to enter foreign property\" and to establish \"access roads\",684 paragraph 3 requires the license holder to \"agree with the owner of the property the scope, method of carrying out and duration of the geological works\" and to notify the owner 15 days in advance of the commencement of exploration activities.685 If no agreement can be reached, pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 29, the license holder cannot enter the property unless he/she obtains a compulsory access order from the MoE.686 Pursuant to the Geology Act, AOG was also to submit a series of reports.687\n\nDecision about extension of the geological survey permit (Svidn\u00edk), Ref. No.: 44505/2010, File No.: 998/2010- 9.3, 26 July 2010, p. 7 of the pdf document, para. 2.6 (C-5).\n\nGeology Act, Article 29(1) (R-42).\n\nGeology Act, Article 29(3) (R-42).\n\nGeology Act, Article 29(5) (R-42).\n\nSee, for instance, Geology Act, Articles 16 and 25(1)(R-42).\n\n435.\n\nAOG was further obliged to respect other legislation, for instance environmental norms, prohibition to drill in protected areas (subject to obtaining an exemption), and restrictions in other areas, all provided in the Nature and Landscapes Act.688 In addition, it was to comply with the Mining Activities Act, the Forest Act, the Protection and Use of Agricultural Land Act, the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Act, and the Protection of Occupational Safety and Health Act.689\n\nAct No. 543/2002 Coll. on Nature and Landscape Protection, as amended (R-43). See Decision on determination of exploration area (Svidn\u00edk), 18 July 2006, pp. 5-7, items 5, 7-8 (R-14).\n\nAct No. 51/1988 Coll. on Mining Activities, as amended (R-44); Act No. 326/2005 Coll. on Forests, as amended (R-70). See Decision on determination of exploration area (Svidn\u00edk), 18 July 2006, pp. 5-7, items 11-13 and 15 (R-14).\n\n436.\n\nAccordingly, Discovery and AOG could not legitimately expect to be allowed to drill if they did not act in compliance with the applicable statutory rules. In determining the legitimacy of expectations, investment tribunals increasingly recognize that an investor \"must exercise a reasonable level of due diligence\",690 specifying that \"[t]he standard of due diligence that investors are expected to adhere to should meet the threshold of what a 'prudent investor' would 'reasonably' do to know about [the] regulatory framework in question\".691 As noted in *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*, the \"scope of the due diligence depends on the particular circumstances of each case, such as the general business environment, and includes an obligation to ensure that a proposed investment complies with local laws\".692\n\n*Churchill Mining v.

Indonesia*, para. 506.\n\n437.\n\nThe Claimant does not deny that the legitimacy and reasonableness of its expectations may depend on the due diligence carried out before deciding to invest.693 In this context, the Tribunal sees no need to assess whether legitimacy and reasonableness also hinge on whether an operator in the extractive industry \"earn[ed] and maintain[ed]\" a social license to operate (\"SLO\"), as argued by the Respondent.694 The Tribunal is of course sensitive to the need to ensure compliance with applicable human rights and environmental obligations, and to the legitimate interests and rights of local populations potentially affected by an investment. That said, the record does not point to any rule of Slovak law requiring an investor to obtain a SLO. Moreover, the awards cited by the Respondent, especially *Bear Creek v. Peru* and *South American Silver v. Bolivia*, concerned investments in areas inhabited by indigenous communities, which enjoy particular protections under international law that are not applicable in the present case.695\n\nTr. (Day 6), 68:13-70:14 (Tushingham) (\"The first point is that due diligence, as you quite rightly pointed out, has been said to be relevant to the content of the legitimate expectations standard protected under the FET provision in the BIT\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 11-12, 302-307 and 444-455; Rejoinder, paras. 280-286, referring to *Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited v.

Peru*, para. 406 (RL-39).\n\n438.\n\nFinally, as noted above, the relevant moment in time as at which to evaluate allegedly legitimate expectations is the period before the investor decides to, and actually does, invest. If the investment is made in stages, it is the time when a new investment decision is taken that is relevant.696 A decision merely implementing an investment (or an element thereof) already decided and planned would not be deemed to be a new investment. Consequently, a decision to drill at a particular site in the context of an existing exploration program or license does not qualify as a new investment requiring a renewed assessment of the legitimacy of the investor's expectations.\n\n*Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 7.76 (RL-74); *Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic*, para. 287 (CL-82); *Muszynianka sp\u00f3\u0142ka v. Slovak Republic*, para. 473 (RL-65).\n\n439.\n\nHere, the relevant point in time is March 2014. This was when the Claimant acquired AOG and decided to invest in its exploration program. It is at that moment that Discovery had to engage in an exercise in due diligence that included careful consideration of the license conditions, as well as the legal, business and political environment, and the specific circumstances of the project.697\n\nOpcom Minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 5 of the pdf document (C-61). See also Opcom Minutes, 16 September 2015, item 4.1 (C-81). The Tribunal notes that AOG identified the Smilno site as a possible well site in the course of the spring of 2015 (Email of 20 May 2015 from Ron Crow (C-424); Email of 20 May 2015 from Michael Lewis (C-423); Varjanov\u00e1 WS1, paras. 9-10). It secured a lease for that location on 1 and 15 June 2015 (Lease for Smilno well site, 1 June 2015 (C-74); Lease of land for Smilno well site, 15 June 2015 (C-76)), and obtained a one-year permit from the Bardejov District Office to use the \"agricultural land\" at the Smilno site \"for non-agricultural purposes\" (Permit from the Bardejov District Office of geological exploration rights in Smilno, 17 June 2015 (C-77)). By 25 August 2015, AOG had submitted a drilling program to the Mining Authority (Partner Progress Report, 25 August 2015 (C-79)) and, by November 2015, it had prepared a project of geological works, a detailed drilling program and an authorization for expenditure (\"APE\") for EUR 1,175,092 (AOG Smilno Project of Geological Works, 11 November 2015 (C-88); Detailed Drilling Program Smilno, December 2015 (C-95); Authority for Expenditure, Smilno, 4 November 2015 (C-86)). On 3 December 2015, the JV Partners approved the 2016 work program and budget and agreed to drill an exploration well at the Smilno site in January 2016 for EUR 986,000, considering the JV Partners' understanding that, because the Smilno-1 well was a \"minimum work obligation\" well, no approval from the Operating Committee was required and that approval of the 2016 work program and budget was sufficient (Opcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, items 5 and 15(5) (C-100); AOG 2016 approved budget, 3 December 2015, pp. 1-2 (C-97)).\n\n440.\n\nIn summary, the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License does not contain any specific representation or assurance that Discovery and AOG could drill at the Smilno site. At most, the Claimant could, by March 2014, expect to be able to drill without hindrance, provided it conducted sufficient due diligence and complied with the applicable laws and regulations and the license conditions. On the assumption such an expectation existed, the Tribunal now reviews whether the Slovak Republic could be said to have frustrated that expectation. As the existence of the expectation is conditioned upon the respect of the law, the first question that arises is whether AOG had the right to use the Access Road.\n\n**(ii) The status of the Access Road**\n--------------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Claimant's case rests on the proposition that the Access Road was publicly accessible because it is a public special purpose road or PSPR. For the Claimant, a field track automatically qualifies as a PSPR under Article 1(2)(d) of Slovakia's Road Act and Article 22 of Decree No. 35/1984 implementing the Road Act698 as well as under Article 2(1) of the Road Traffic Act.699 Discovery adds that in July 2015 the Mayor of Smilno, Mr. Baran, had confirmed that the Access Road was publicly accessible and that official maps showed that it was a \"public road\".700\n\nReply, para. 72(1), referring to Road Act, Article 1(3) (R-57); Decree No. 35/1984, Coll. implementing the Road Act, Article 22 (C-223).\n\nReply, para. 73, referring to Road Traffic Act, Article 2(1) (C-214).\n\nReply, para. 61(2), referring to Minutes of Meeting, 21 July 2015 (C-280); Tr. (Day 1), 81:17-18 (Tushingham).\n\n442.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Access Road is a private field track and that AOG was required to secure land owner consent or obtain an access order pursuant to Article 29(3) to (5) of the Geology Act. It also states that, even if the field track were a PSPR, the technical and physical condition of the track was such that it could not be used for heavy drilling machinery and therefore AOG would still have needed to obtain the owners' consent to upgrade the road.\n\n443.\n\nIt is undisputed that, in June 2015, AOG had entered into a 15-year lease with the land owners of the Smilno site to drill an exploratory well,701 and that it had obtained a one-year permit from the Bardejov District Office to such effect.702 It is equally common ground that the Access Road was the only means of vehicular access to the site. The Parties further agree that, if the Access Road qualifies as a PSPR, AOG could have used it without owner consent and that, if it was a private road or field track, AOG was bound to secure consent or an access order.\n\nLease for Smilno well site, 1 June 2015 (C-74); Lease of land for Smilno well site, 15 June 2015 (C-76).\n\nPermit from the Bardejov District Office of geological exploration rights in Smilno, 17 June 2015 (C-77). See also Application to the Bardejov District Office for permit of geological exploration rights in Smilno, 1 June 2015 (C-75).\n\n444.\n\nThe question is thus whether the Access Road is a PSPR or not. To resolve this question, the Tribunal will first address the legal framework governing Slovak roads, then review the characteristics of the Access Road. It will then inquire about Discovery and AOG's conduct of an exercise of due diligence and their contemporaneous understanding of the Access Road's status.\n\nThe legal framework governing Slovak roads\n------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nA review of the Slovak legal framework shows that not every field track is a PSPR and that, even if the Access Road were a PSPR, AOG should have adapted to the technical conditions of the road and obtained land owner consent for any upgrades. The Tribunal was assisted by expert evidence and testimony on Slovak law, as provided by Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek on the Claimant's side and Dr. Foga\u0161 on the Respondent's side.\n\n446.\n\nThe relevant legal framework comprises the Road Act, its implementing decree and the Road Traffic Act. The Road Act regulates *inter alia* \"the construction, use and protection of land roads, rights and obligations of owners and managers of land roads and their users\".703 Aside from governing the road traffic rules, the Road Traffic Act regulates \"the competence of public administration authorities\" in directing road traffic.704 Importantly, the Slovak authorities, and in particular the police, only have authority to regulate traffic on the \"roads\" as defined in those two acts.705\n\nRoad Act, Article 1(1) (R-57).\n\nRoad Traffic Act, Article 1 (R-174).\n\nFor instance, the \"road manager\" or the police have authority to a remove stationary vehicle on such roads if \"it forms an obstacle to road traffic\". Road Traffic Act, Articles 2(1) and 43 (C-214 and R-174). See also Letter of 3 May 2010 from the Presidium of the Police Forces to Regional Police Directorates, p. 2 (R-202).\n\n447.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the Road Act and Article 2(1) of the Road Traffic Act distinguish between four types of \"surface roads\" or \"surface communications\" depending on \"traffic significance, destination and technical equipment\":706 highways, roads, municipal communications, and special purpose communications.707 The Parties' common understanding is that PSPRs fall within the last category of \"special purpose communications\" (the Slovak expression in the Road Act is *\u00fa\u010delov\u00e9 komunik\u00e1cie* and in the Road Traffic Act it is *\u00fa\u010delov\u00fdch komunik\u00e1ci\u00ed*).\n\nRoad Act, Article 1(2) (R-57).\n\nRoad Act, Article 1(2)(a)-(b) (R-57); Road Traffic Act, Article 2(1) (C-214 and R-174). The Claimant and Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek do not dispute that the four categories of roads mentioned in Article 2(1) of the Road Traffic Act correspond to the four categories listed in Article 1(2) of the Road Act. Reply, para. 73; Tr. (Day 4), 50:11-18 (\u0160tev\u010dek).\n\n448.\n\nThe Parties agree that anyone may use the four types of \"surface communications\" listed in Article 2(1) of the Road Act pursuant to the right of \"general use\" enshrined in Article 6(1) of the Road Act, which reads as follows:\n\n\"Traffic on surface communications is regulated by special regulations; within their boundaries, everyone can use surface communication[s] in the usual way for the purposes for which they are intended (hereinafter only 'general use'). The users must adapt to the construction condition and traffic-technical condition of the affected communication; it must not damage or pollute it\".708\n\nRoad Act, Article 6(1) (R-158).\n\n449.\n\nIt follows that the right of \"general use\" extends to the four categories of roads listed in Article 2(1) of the Road Act, not to other types of roads or tracks.709 It also follows from this provision that roads must be used \"in the usual way\", \"for the purposes for which they are intended\", and taking into account their \"construction [\u2026] and traffic-technical condition\".\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Respondent's explanation that, although the 2016 version of the Road Act \"did not list special purpose roads\" in Article 6, because PSPRs are either public or private, the right of general use nonetheless applied to PSPRs (Rejoinder, Appendix, note 3). Indeed, in 2011, the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov held that, although the right of general use in Article 6 of the Road Act only applied to motorways, roads and local roads, this did \"not mean that special purpose roads could not have the characteristic of publicly accessible roads\", further adding that \"[n]on-inclusion of special purpose roads into Section 6 of the Roads Act was caused solely by the fact that special purpose roads, unlike motorways, roads and local roads, are not exclusively intended for general use\". Resolution of the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov, File no. 6Co/85/2011, 17 October 2011, pp. 4-5 of the pdf document (C-16).\n\n450.\n\nMoreover, in respect of the fourth road category, Article 22(3) of the Road Act distinguishes between \"public and non-public\" PSPRs. It establishes a presumption that PSPRs are public, unless they are located \"within closed premises or isolated objects\" or have been classified as \"non-public\" by the municipality \"with the consent of its owner\".710\n\nIn other words, anyone can use a PSPR, unless it is \"non-public\" and provided the use comports with the road's intended purpose and the user adapts to the condition of the road.711 If the condition of the road does not allow a specific use, according to Article 19(1) of the Road Act, the user must obtain the agreement of the owner of the road to make the necessary adjustments.712\n\nRoad Act, Article 22(3) (R-175 and C-221).\n\nThe Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov confirmed in 2011 that owners of \"public\" PSPRs cannot exclude the public from using such roads, even if privately owned: \"According to Section 22(3) of the Roads Act, special purpose roads are divided into public and non-public special purpose roads. Non-public are only those located in closed areas or structures and those that municipalities re-classify to non-public with their owners' consent. Other special purpose roads are therefore public by their nature. The fact that some special purpose roads are designated as public means that it is impossible that such special purpose roads would be used exclusively by their owners\". Resolution of the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov, File no. 6Co/85/2011, 17 October 2011, p. 5 of the pdf document (C-16).\n\nThe Respondent's translation of Article 19(1) reads as follows: \"For major constructions, mining works or landscaping that require a building permit or other permit according to special regulations, a surface communication is to be used, the construction and technical equipment of which does not correspond to the required traffic on this road, the necessary adjustments must be made to it after agreement with its owner or manager. If performance of the adjustments is not effective or possible, new road communication that corresponds to [the] expected traffic load must be constructed. Construction of new communication or adjustment of existing surface communication shall be secured on own costs of those who necessitate that need\". Road Act, Article 19(1) (R-175).\n\n451.\n\nUnder Article 1(3) of the Road Act, \"surface communications\", including PSPRs, consist of a \"road body and its components\", including \"outer edges of ditches, gutters, embankments and cuts of slopes, frame and cladding walls\":\n\n\"Surface communication consists of the road body and its components. The road body is demarcated [by] the outer edges of ditches, gutters, embankments and cuts of slopes, frame and cladding walls, at the foot of retaining walls and on local roads half a meter behind raised curbs sidewalks or green belts\".713\n\nRoad Act, Article 1(3) (R-57 and R-175).\n\n452.\n\nThis provision implies that a field track or a forest road only qualifies as a PSPR if it has a \"road body\".714 As noted by the District Court of Pre\u0161ov and the Regional Court of Kosice, a road is of a \"tangible nature that is recognizable in the landscape\" and possesses \"certain technical qualities\", meaning that \"any modification of a plot of land from which it only follows that the land is used for communication purposes, e.g. after a path has been treaded and no other roadworks have been constructed, cannot be deemed a road\".715 The Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice further held that a road body has its \"own legal regime different from the legal regime of a land plot\".716 Thus, for instance, the District Court in Pre\u0161ov considered that modifying a plot of land by laying concrete panels and pouring gravel was a \"temporary alteration\" that did not allow it to be deemed a road.717 Similarly, the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice found that not even a \"concrete pavement layer with the thickness of approximately 20 cm\" qualified as a PSPR since it had no demarcation on the outer edges or other characteristics of a road body.718 For its part, the MoT held that \"the laying down [of] macadam or other stone materials on a grass surface or making rutts in a field does not constitute a special purpose road\".719\n\n\"MR DRYMER: [\u2026] If a field road meets the criteria set out in Article 1(3) of the Road Act, is it considered a special purpose road; yes or no? A. Yes\". Tr. (Day 4), 45:3-6 (\u0160tev\u010dek). See also Rejoinder, Appendix, para. 11.\n\nAlthough the appellate court annulled the first instance decision *inter alia* because the \"exact nature of [the] technical quality\" of the road in question could not be established from that decision, it did not appear to take issue with the interpretation of Article 1(3). The appellate court only specified that it did \"not follow\" from Article 1(3) that a road structure had to be connected to the ground by a \"solid foundation\". On this latter point, the MoT took a different view in a decision rendered in June 2023 where it stated, by reference to Article 22(2) read in conjunction with Article 16 of the Road Act, that a PSPR \"must have the nature of a structure\" that is \"firmly fixed to the ground\" in the sense of Article 43(1) of the Construction Act.

It therefore does not meet the definition of a road body, set out in the Road Act. In addition, it is not connected to the land plot by a subsoil that is usual for any structure of surface communication. [\u2026] According to the above, we can derive that from the legal perspective, the 'communication' in question is not a surface communication that has an own legal regime. The appellate court is of the opinion that it is more appropriate to use [the] term [of] a 'civil engineering structure (access road)' for that structure that does not have an own legal regime but a legal regulation of the property \u2013 land plot on which it is situated. Since the plaintiff is the owner of the land plot on which the civil engineering structure (access road) in question is located, which was not disputed in the proceedings, the plaintiff should be perceived as the owner of the civil engineering structure (access road) located on the land plot\").\n\nDecision of the Ministry of Transport, 19 June 2023, p. 7 of the pdf document (R-204).\n\n453.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the Road Act specifies that the design of surface communications must be carried out in accordance with applicable technical norms and regulations.720 The technical norm STN 73 6100, which is entitled \"Terminology of Surface Communications\", defines a \"road body\" as a \"road structure\" consisting of an earth bed, a pavement, shoulders and drainage.721 An \"earth bed\" is built of \"rock and soil using prescribed technology\" with a predetermined shape \"depending on the terrain, vertical alignment, type and properties of materials\", and is divided into an \"embankment\", a \"cutt\" and a \"cut-off\".722 In turn, an \"embankment\" is \"[a]n earth bed built of rock or soil in prescribed dimensions above the original terrain level with landscaped slopes and a plain\"; a \"cutt\" is \"[a]n earth bed created by excavation and removal of natural soil (rock) to create a leveled plain\"; and a \"cut-off\" is \"[a]n earth bed on a slope created in cross section by a cut on one side and embankment on the other side\".723 In all these cases, the earth bed is typically placed above the original terrain level, on top of which a \"pavement\" is placed that has \"shoulders\" and \"drainage\". Consequently, a road body requires some form of civil engineering and a track leading through a field, even if publicly accessible, cannot qualify as a \"road\" under the Road Act or the Road Traffic Act.\n\nArticle 2(4) provides: \"The design of surface communications shall be carried out in accordance with applicable Slovak technical norms, technical regulations and objectively ascertained results of research and development for the road infrastructure\". Road Act, Article 2(4) (R-175). See Rejoinder, Appendix, para. 6.\n\nEmphasis in the original.

Judgment of the Regional Court Ko\u0161ice, case No. 6Co/188/2016, 31 January 2017, para. 42 (R-205). Article 22(2) provides that \"[t]he provision of Article 16 applies to obtaining permission for the construction of a special purpose road\". Article 16(1) and (2) in turn reads in relevant part as follows:  \n\"(1) The commencement of the construction of a highway, road or local communication and their alterations shall require a building permit issued by a special building authority (Article 3a), unless specified otherwise hereinafter.  \n(2) Notification to the special building authority shall be sufficient for  \na) construction alterations to the road body and components of the surface communication [\u2026],  \nb) maintenance work on the road body and on components of surface communications which could affect the stability of the structure, its appearance or the environment in the vicinity of the surface communication [\u2026]\". Road Act, Articles 16(1)-(2) and 22(2) (R-175).\n\n455.\n\nThe Claimant relies on Article 22 of the Decree implementing the Road Act, which is also entitled \"Special purpose roads\", to argue that a field or forest road automatically qualifies as a PSPR irrespective of whether such road meets the criteria of Article 1(3) or whether a building permit was issued for its construction under Article 16 of the Road Act.726\n\nAlthough Article 22 of the Decree confirms that \"field and forest roads\" may qualify as PSPRs, it does not say that *all* field and forest roads always qualify as such. The Tribunal therefore cannot agree with the Claimant's position that any field and forest road automatically qualifies as a PSPR.727 As discussed above, a field and forest road is a PSPR if it has a road body as defined in the legislation.728 The difference between roads with a road body qualifying *ex lege* as PSPRs and field or forest roads that do not qualify as PSPRs is reinforced by Article 21(1) of the Road Traffic Act, which distinguishes between PSPRs, field tracks and forest roads.729 As the Regional Court in Ko\u0161ice held, the consequence of that distinction is that a field track lacking road body \"does not have an own legal regime\" distinct from that of the land on which it is situated and that the owner of the land also owns the field track.730\n\nArticle 22 of the Decree reads as follows:  \n\"(1) Special purpose roads include, in particular, field and forest roads, access roads to plants, construction sites, quarries, mines, sand pits and other objects, and roads in enclosed areas and sites.  \n(2) Special purpose roads in enclosed areas and sites are non-public; other special purpose roads may be declared to be non-public by the local national committee on the proposal of the owner, administrator or user of the road in question, in accordance with generally binding regulations.  \n(3) The legal position of special purpose roads is governed by general regulations\". Decree No. 35/1984, Coll. implementing the Road Act, Article 22 (C-223).\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this context that the Slovak land registry distinguishes between PSPRs and forest or field roads, thus further confirming that the Claimant's understanding on automaticity is unsupported by its own evidence. Land Registry Extract Plot (945) dated 20 June 2016 (C-139).\n\nAlthough Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek opined that field roads are \"[i]n principle\" always PSPRs, he agreed that this was only the case if a PSPR met the technical definition of Article 1(3) of the Road Act, namely that the field road would need to have a \"road body\" (Tr. (Day 4), 43:6-23 (\u0160tev\u010dek)). He sought to find comfort for his opinion that field roads qualify as PSPRs in Article 22 of the Decree by arguing that the decree was \"lex specialis\"; however, he conceded after a prolonged exchange that, in case of conflict between a law and a decree, the former would necessarily prevail as a matter of hierarchy of norms (Tr. (Day 4), 43:24-:49:17 (\u0160tev\u010dek) and, in particular, 49:14-17 (\u0160tev\u010dek)). In the end, he insisted on numerous occasions that he was not an expert of road law and the Tribunal therefore did not find his explanations, for instance, that the legislator had committed an \"error\" and that his interpretation based on the decree was to be preferred, to be convincing or helpful (Tr. (Day 4), 47:12-14 and 49:21-22 (\u0160tev\u010dek)).\n\nArticle 21(1) reads as follows: \"When entering a road from a place off the road, from a field track, from a forest road, from a cycle path, from a residential area or from a pedestrian zone, the driver shall be obliged to give way to a vehicle driving on the road\". Road Traffic Act, Article 21(1) (R-174). This distinction is also confirmed by the definition of \"Code 22\" in the \"C\" Register, which refers to \"22 \u2013 Land, on which an engineering structure is built \u2013 road, local and special-purpose road, forest road, field road, sidewalk, uncovered parking lots and parts thereof\". See Land Registry Extract Plot (945), 20 June 2016 (C-139). The Tribunal notes that Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek accepted that Article 21(1) differentiates between PSPRs and field or forest roads. Tr. (Day 4), 51:11-14 (\u0160tev\u010dek).\n\nJudgment of the Regional Court Ko\u0161ice, case No. 6Co/188/2016, 31 January 2017, para. 44 (R-205).\n\n456.\n\nFinally, evidence of the practice of Slovak authorities, such as the police and the MoT, shows that, even if they do not meet the requirements under the Road Act, field tracks may qualify as PSPRs, if they are registered as such in municipal registries, for instance in the \"Land Register in the cadastral map or the map of the designated cadastral files\", or \"in other records (e.g. records of the owner or administrator of forest land, field land, etc.)\".731\n\nLetter of 3 May 2010 from the Presidium of the Police Forces to Regional Police Directorates, p. 2 (R-202); Decision of the Ministry of Transport, 19 June 2023, p. 7 of the pdf document (R-204).\n\n457.\n\nTo summarize, the review of the applicable Slovak legal framework does not support the Claimant's position that any field track as such is automatically to be characterized as a PSPR under the applicable law. The legal framework confirms that a field track can only qualify as a PSPR if it has a \"road body\" as defined in Article 1(3) of the Road Act and the applicable technical norms. Slovak practice also envisages the possibility of a field track qualifying as a PSPR if it is registered as such by the municipality or in cadastral maps of the land register. In other words, the Claimant can only succeed with its argument that the Access Road is a PSPR if it can show that it fulfils those technical norms or is registered as a PSPR in official registers. Moreover, even if the Access Road is a PSPR, AOG could only have used it in accordance with its technical condition or subject to the owners' agreeing to any upgrades.\n\nThe characteristics of the Access Road\n--------------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nThe Access Road is located in the municipality of Smilno in the district of Bardejov. The title deed no. 1367 shows that it covers an area of 11,600 m\u00b2 and is registered as \"arable land\" in the E Land Registry under the lot number 2721/780.732 As of June 2016, it was co-owned by 171 individuals.733\n\nLand Registry Extract Plot (2721), 20 June 2016 (C-140); Title Deed No. 1367, 21 March 2023 (R-35).\n\nThe Claimant asserts that land plot no. 2721/780 was co-owned by 166 individuals. Although the last entry in the extract of the title deed no. 1367 dated 20 June 2016 identifying the last co-owners is number \"209\", 38 entries have been deleted meaning that the title deed contains only 171 entries. The record confirms that the number of co-owners evolved throughout that period. For instance, in a decision of the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov dated 14 April 2016, reference is made to \"the other 201 co-owners\", which, depending on the reading of that decision, means that there were at that time either 202 or 203 co-owners. By contrast, in a decision dated 16 February 2017, the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov stated that title deed no. 1367 listed 216 co-owners.

See Memorial, para. 83; Varjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 18; Fraser WS1, para. 38.\n\n459.\n\nThe Parties have referred to land plot no. 2721/780 (registered in the E Land Registry) and to land plot no. 945, which covers an area of 11,566 m\u00b2 and is registered in the C Land Registry.734 The cadastral map first put in the record suggests that land plots nos. 2721/780 and 945, although not entirely identical, partly overlap.735 From the evidence provided with the second round of submissions and in particular the images below, the Tribunal understands that at least until 2010 the Access Road was located on land plot no. 945 (left image) and that, by 2017, it was located, at least in its final section, on land plot no. 2721/780 (right image):736\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//461f3c4941c2c617fbb82b21f5a6e29bcf8c93d9.png)\n\nLand Registry Extract Plot (2721), 20 June 2016 (C-140); Land Registry Extract Plot (945), 20 June 2016 (C-139). For instance, the Claimant asserted that the Access Road was, at the same time, registered in the E Land Registry as plot no. 2721/780 and in the C Land Registry as plot no. 945 (Memorial, para. 83).\n\nSee Cadastral Map of Land Plots 945 and 2721/780 (R-56). The Tribunal notes that Article 70 of the Cadastral Act establishes a general presumption of validity of cadastral data \"unless the contrary is proved\", with the exception of \"[t]he type of land registered as a parcel of the 'E' register\" which \"shall not be deemed to be a binding cadastral data\". That said, as the Claimant acknowledges, there is no title deed in the record for land plot 945, whereas the record does contain a title deed for land plot 2721/780. Moreover, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1, one of the undisputed co-owners of the Access Road, testified that she co-owned land plot 2721/780 and she in fact acted in Slovak courts as co-owner of that plot of land. Importantly, AOG entered into a purchase contract on 17 December 2015 to acquire a 1/700 share of the \"real property\" \"registered in the Ownership Certificate number 1367 as land, lot of land of the 'E' Register, registered on the map of the specified documentation no. 2721/780, arable land with an area of 11,660 m\u00b2\". Finally, Mayor Baran, who is also a co-owner of the Access Road with a 1/315 share, confirmed that title deed no. 1367 related to the Access Road. Accordingly, for all relevant purposes, the Tribunal understands that the Access Road is located on land plot 2721/780.

See also Aerial photographs of the field track (R-209).\n\n460.\n\nSince the Parties agree that, at the relevant time, the Access Road was located on plot no. 2721/780, the Tribunal will primarily refer to that plot, with occasional references to land plot no. 945 where useful.\n\n461.\n\nContemporaneous photographs taken by AOG demonstrate that, at least until June 2016, the Access Road was a field track with no discernible road body. In proximity of the drill site, the track was overgrown with grass with slight markings suggesting that agricultural vehicles occasionally drove over it. Both Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 and Mr. Baran agreed that it was mainly used by local farmers to access the surrounding agricultural lands.737 Mr. Baran testified that it was also used by hunters, by others collecting strawberries, mushrooms or wood, and by cyclists.738 Until the end of World War II, the track had also been used to access a quartz mine, which, according to Mr. Baran, used to be \"located just 100 hundred meters from AOG's proposed drilling site\" within the \"V shaped 'forest' next to it\".739\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS2, para. 19; Baran WS, para. 19; Tr.

Map of Smilno, 23 August 2023 (C-420).\n\n462.\n\nThe Access Road is a little over 1km long (between 700 and 800 meters according to Mr. Baran)740 going from the village of Smilno to AOG's drill site.741 The following image shows the Access Road marked in bright green and the drill site in the lower right corner:742\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//9fda9533b539083282cfd987709bd9ec0188025b.png)\n\nTr.

According to Mr. Baran, that track was commonly used in the past to connect both localities before a municipal road was built.743 This may explain why the first half of the Access Road appears paved whereas the second half does not.744 Mr. Baran also stated that the first part of the road was \"used much more\", and that the second \"was the less-used road\".745 Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's evidence confirms that \"the sections near the municipal road were in better condition than the upper-lying sections\", the \"initial sections [being] mostly composed of gravel\", while the \"upper sections [i.e. the second part] were, at most, a mere visible trace left by vehicles that passed over them, depending on the agricultural cooperative's needs\".746\n\nTr. (Day 3), 38:18-21 and 59:23-60:16 (Baran) (\"This one was used much more towards the village of Mikul\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1, because they are also employees, and when it's good weather they go by terrain vehicles towards the farm, not using the main road\").\n\nTr. (Day 3), 42:14-15 (Baran); Varjanov\u00e1 WS2, para. 20 (\"As for the track surface, the sections near the municipal road were in better condition than the upper-lying sections. The initial sections were mostly composed of gravel. However, the upper sections were, at most, a mere visible trace left by vehicles that passed over them, depending on the agricultural cooperative's needs\").\n\nTr. (Day 3), 38:18-21 and 59:23-60:16 (Baran).\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS2, para. 20.\n\n464.\n\nThe following three pictures were taken by AOG in August 2014 from the position indicated in the lower left corner: the first at the junction with a municipal road in Smilno, the second at about half-point, and the third in proximity of the drill site:747\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//ad378c930f39361de9fac0f2c58f7f9451fb9a58.png)\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//c6854d15bb470c029f4aaf79f6b35432969db02d.png)\n\nWell site locations visit note, 20 August 2014, pp. 8-10 of the pdf document (C-60).\n\n465.\n\nMr. Baran said that the last picture does not depict the Access Road, which was further to the \"upper right side\".748 Be this as it may, the following picture taken on 21 July 2015 and showing Mr. Baran (on the left) standing on the Access Road corroborates that the Access Road close to the drill site was best characterized as a track that passed through the fields:749\n\n[Redacted]\n\nAccording to Mr. Baran, the site where AOG would ultimately prepare the drill site is, on the third image, located \"like 100 meters straight forward\". Tr. (Day 3), 41:12-17 (Baran).\n\nEmail of 5 August 2015 from Michael Lewis, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-281).\n\n466.\n\nIt is clear from these pictures that the Access Road had no road body. This is buttressed by Mr. Baran's explanation that the exact location of the track changed depending on the season as users sought to avoid the mud caused by heavy rainfall.750 In fact, the purpose of AOG's 21 July 2015 site visit with Mr. Baran and a \"farm engineer\", i.e. a member of the board of the Smilno Bio-Association, was precisely to determine \"the location of the access road\", meaning that the layout of the track was not necessarily apparent on the ground.751 Following AOG's 21 July 2015 site inspection with Mr. Baran, Mr. Lewis informed the JV Partners that Mr. Baran had requested that the track \"be moved a few meters from its original position\".752\n\nTr. (Day 3), 30:6-13 (Baran) (\"A. Well, I'm not sure it was exactly the track, because there, at that time and even now, there are like two tracks, and when it was muddy, you know, the vehicles went to the left or right, you know, not to get into mud. So it's definitely the direction, but I'm not sure whether we're exactly on that road, I mean geographically. But yes, we're on that road, yes, in the direction to that site\").\n\nMinutes of Meeting, 21 July 2015 (C-280).\n\nEmail of 5 August 2015 from Michael Lewis, p. 2 (C-281).\n\n467.\n\nIt is also clear from these pictures and the evidence more generally that the track as AOG found it was not suited to move heavy machinery. AOG was aware of this, as it planned to upgrade the field track and eventually did so.753 Specifically, in June 2016, AOG hired the company GMT Project to \"upgrade\" the Access Road \"by laying some more crushed stone along the length of it\",754 which the following image depicts:755\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//f548fa2d652eb33b668c95776a2abe692085521c.png)\n\nFor instance, in August 2014, AOG deemed that \"maybe half length [sic] of this road requires some modifications only\" (Well site locations visit note, 20 August 2014, p. 16 of the pdf document (C-60)). In an internal email dated 6 July 2015, AOG stated that the Access Road \"will be repaired and modified in some parts and its 150m part close to the well site will be moved to other location as requested by the mayor and in assistance of surveyor\" (Email of 6 July 2015 from Ron Crow, p. 1 (C-278)). Then, in a progress report dated 25 August 2015, Mr. Lewis told the JV Partners that \"[a]ccess from the main highway is under construction\" and \"would be finished by September 15th\", further adding that AOG was \"in contact with the road construction company\", which \"will prepare the entrance to our requirements\" (Partner Progress Report, 25 August 2015 (C-79)). Although AOG projected a slide during a meeting of the operating committee on 16 September 2015 imaging the Access Road and drill site saying \"[l]ess road construction necessary\" (Opcom Presentation, 16 September 2015, slide 73 (C-80)), it then told its JV Partners on 3 December 2015 that \"[t]he access road will need to be upgraded and in one place relocated slightly, by agreement with the mayor\" (Opcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, p. 1 (C-100)). According to AOG's December 2015 drilling program, it hired the company TDE Field Services to build the \"access road to the drilling site\", but local protests in that month prevented any construction works (Detailed Drilling Programme Smilno, December 2015, p. 22 (C-95)). Mr. Fraser testified that AOG's plan was to \"improv[e] the access road, by levelling and draining certain sections of it\" (Fraser WS1, para. 34).\n\nFraser WS1, para. 52; Fraser WS2, paras. 13-15. On 18 May 2016, AOG requested from GMT an offer for the \"construction/improvement\" of the Access Road. That request distinguished works between a 380-meter section of \"[u]npaved road\" from the bifurcation to the drill site, a 940-meter section of \"[p]aved road\", and a 20-meter section at the point of entry to the Access Road in the village of Smilno. GMT was asked to lay crushed stone and create drainage on the unpaved section, to improve drainage on the paved section, and to spread some sand or crushed stone to \"improve existing road\" at the entry point. Email from [REDACTED] attaching request for quotation from GMT Projekt, 18 May 2016, pp. 1-2 and 7-12 of the pdf document (C-309).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\n468.\n\nIn upgrading the track, AOG created \"an actual, makeshift 'road'\", by moving the last part of the Access Road, originally located on land plot no. 945 (the red dotted line in the photo below), onto land plot no. 2721/780 (the magenta colored line):756\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//bba3969a2e482d439db9f832481cd2b168a81703.png)\n\nCompare Statement from the Geodesy and Cartography Office of the Slovak Republic, 8 December 2023, p. 3 of the pdf document (R-212) with Aerial photographs of the field track, pp. 3 and 5 (R-209).\n\n469.\n\nThe Claimant raises several arguments in an attempt to buttress its PSPR argument. First, it argues that the entry code \"22\" in the C register for plot no. 945 shows that the Access Road is a PSPR.757 Code \"22\" is defined as \"[l]and, on which an engineering structure is built - road, local and special-purpose road, forest road, field road, sidewalk, uncovered parking lot and parts thereof'.758 As discussed above, the Claimant's reliance on this register is misplaced since the Access Road is situated on plot no. 2721/780, not on plot no. 945. In any event, code \"22\" distinguishes PSPRs and forest or field roads and it is impossible to discern from this extract of the register whether plot no. 945 is a PSPR or a field road.759 Moreover, the extract is dated 20 June 2016, i.e. after AOG's upgrades that took place on 7 June 2016. This means that the Tribunal cannot determine whether this entry relates to the situation before or after the upgrade.\n\nMemorial, para. 84.\n\nLand Registry Extract Plot (945), 20 June 2016 (C-139).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 62:12-63:19 (Baran).\n\n470.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the contemporaneous cadastral map for land plot no. 945 taken from the online portal of the UGKK demonstrates that the Access Road is a PSPR.760 However, just as with the C register discussed above, the Claimant's reliance on this map is inapposite, since it concerns land plot no. 945 and appears to have been generated after AOG's upgrade.761\n\nTr. (Day 1), 41:17-42:2 (Tushingham); Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 83.\n\nLetter from AOG's Attorney to Bardejov Police, 17 June 2016, p. 6 of the pdf document (C-315). Here too, Mr. Baran confirmed that it was impossible to ascertain from that map and its legend whether the Access Road was registered as a PSPR or a field/dirt road (Tr. (Day 3), 53:14-20 (Baran)).\n\n471.\n\nThird, the Claimant contends that historical maps and satellite imagery from Google Earth confirm that the Access Road \"always has been\" publicly accessible and therefore a PSPR.762 However, these documents are similarly inconclusive. Although the historical military map of 1920 and the \u00daGKK map of 2000 identify the Access Road with a \"solid black line\", there is no legend attached to those maps allowing to ascertain the meaning of that line.763 As for the satellite image, allegedly from 2006, it only shows a track leading towards the drill site and going into the forest.764 If anything, that image confirms that the track bifurcating towards the village of Mikul\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 was more used at the time than the track in question.\n\nReply, para. 60(4)-(5); Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 62.\n\nHistorical Military Map of Smilno, 1920 (C-420); Map of Smilno, 2000 (C-245).\n\nGoogle Earth Satellite Images of Smilno, 2006-2016, p. 1 of the pdf document (C-246).\n\n472.\n\nFourth, the Claimant argues that two other official maps on the \u00daGKK portal confirm that the Access Road is a PSPR and adds that \"Discovery/AOG consulted and relied upon these official maps\".765 These maps identify the Access Road as an \"unpaved road\"766 or as a \"local, purpose-built communication\" whose \"surface type\" is \"loose/unpaved\".767 This description suggests that there is no road body in the sense of Article 1(3) of the Road Act. More importantly, it is apparent that these maps post-date the June 2016 upgrade of the Access Road since they identify the drill site and the last part of the road (the \"hook\")768 leading from plot no. 2721/780 to the drill site. In fact, these maps appear to have been generated or downloaded in 2019 or later.769 Accordingly, they cannot be relied upon as an accurate representation of the situation that pertained at the relevant time.\n\nReply, para. 60(2)-(3) and note 119.\n\nMap of Smilno, 23 August 2023, pp. 1 and 3 of the pdf document (C-418).

(Day 3), 50:21-52:4 (Baran).\n\n473.\n\nInformation provided by \u00daGKK on 8 December 2023 and submitted with the Rejoinder suggests that the Access Road was added to \u00daGKK's database system (the \"ZBGIS system\") in 2006 and 2008 and was registered as a \"field track until 2019\" (in Slovak, a \"*Lesn\u00e1, po\u013en\u00e1 cesta*\").770 The Claimant did not challenge or otherwise comment on this information during the Hearing.771 The Tribunal therefore can only conclude that the maps and other documents invoked by the Claimant do not support its argument that the Access Road was a PSPR at the relevant time.\n\nIt was first registered on 18 September 2006, based on \"[v]erified data\", as a \"[l]oose/unpaved\" \"[f]orest, field track\" that was \"[n]ot maintained in winter\". It was then registered on 3 November 2008 \"[a]fter on-site inspection\" as a \"[l]oose/unpaved\" \"[f]orest, field track\" that was \"[i]n working condition\". The Statement goes on to mention that the status changed on 10 May 2019 to a \"local, special-purpose road\" (in Slovak, a \"*Miestna, \u00fa\u010delov\u00e1 komunik\u00e1cia*\"), \"based on the assessment by the authorized maker (*of the map*) of how the objects appear in the terrain\", it being specified that that determination was \"not based on legal documents or opinions\" and was \"for information purposes only\". Statement from the Geodesy and Cartography Office of the Slovak Republic, 8 December 2023, pp. 1-3 of the pdf document (R-212).\n\nThis document was put to Mr. Baran during cross-examination, but the Claimant did not further raise any issue in its respect during re-direct or at any other time during the Hearing. Tr. (Day 3), 50:21-51:5 (Baran).\n\n474.\n\nAs a final point, it is recalled that the Smilno municipality confirmed on 3 November 2016, in response to a request for information from the District Police Directorate of Bardejov, that it never issued any \"building permit\" in relation to \"plot of land E 2721/780\", nor had it ever \"permitted any construction and technical modification\".772 Considering that the construction of a PSPR requires a permit under the Road Act, that statement as well as the absence of any affirmative evidence of any building permit serves to confirm the conclusion that the Access Road was not a PSPR at the relevant time.\n\nLetter of 3 November 2016 from Smilno Municipality (R-61).\n\n475.\n\nIn sum, against the background of the applicable legal framework, the evidence before the Tribunal as to the physical characteristics of the Access Road establishes that it was not a PSPR.\n\nDue diligence and knowledge of the status of the Access Road\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the course of the Hearing it became increasingly apparent that the Claimant had not conducted any meaningful legal due diligence as to the status of the Access Road,773 although it claimed to have carried out a \"factual due diligence\" that it said was \"extensive\".774 Without addressing whether, in light of its timing, such a purported exercise of due diligence can satisfy the requirement for the invocation of legitimate expectations, the Tribunal notes that the claims as to the exercise in due diligence included \"going around and talking to the mayor\", and consulting \"multiple\" \"official maps\" that \"expressly identified the road\".775 These investigations were sufficient for Mr. Lewis to say that he \"knew at the time\" \u2013 that is to say by early 2016 \u2013 that \"there was a public right to use the road\".776 Discovery relied on Mr. Baran's statement that the Access Road was a \"public road\" or \"publicly accessible\", which it found \"entirely reasonable\" and \"plainly sufficient\", especially since \"[n]obody at that time was raising any suggestion that this was private property\", adding that \"the documents are consistent with that\".777\n\nTr. (Day 1), 28:5-30:19 (Tushingham) (\"Of course we can't point to a legal opinion that has been produced in this arbitration which confirms at the time that the road was a public road\" and \"We can't point to a document which expressly confirms that at the time, prior to the investment, that the road was a public road\"). See also Tr. (Day 2), 136:20-22 (Fraser) and Tr. (Day 2), 221:22-222:6 (Lewis).\n\nTr. (Day 1), 29:19-23 (Tushingham).\n\nTr. (Day 1), 29:19-30:19 (Tushingham).\n\nLewis WS1, para. 57.\n\nTr. (Day 1), 28:24-29:4 and 30:3-7 (Tushingham).\n\n477.\n\nThese explanations are not convincing. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that Discovery obtained legal advice as to the status of the Access Road. Had it done so, it would have discovered that: the operator of the quartz mine, which was in operation until the end of World War II, had secured a lease from the then owner(s) of the field track to access the mine;778 the Access Road was on privately owned land; even if \"publicly accessible\", it could only be used for its intended purpose, which did not include the transportation of drilling equipment; under Article 19(1) of the Road Act, upgrading the Access Road required the consent of the land owners;779 and an agreement with the land owners of the Access Road was required on \"the scope, manner and duration\" of any exploration, which was also clear from the 2010 license renewal.780\n\nTr. (Day 3), 39:23-40:3 (Baran) (\"Q. So historically the road was leased to a person or a corporation which operated a quartz mine there? A. Exactly. Q So they were using the road on the basis of the lease they had with the owner of the road; correct? A. Correct\").\n\nRoad Act, Article 19(1) (R-175).\n\nMr. Fraser testified that, once he formally became AOG's full-time CFO in July 2015, he assumed the \"responsibility for monitoring regulatory or legal matters\". He further stated that he generally \"became aware\" of Article 29 of the Geology Act \"probably mid- or late 2015\", but not of the \"particular subparagraph\" in Article 29(3). He could not \"recall\" when he became aware of that particular provision, further adding that \"the day-to-day permitting was handled\" by AOG's \"Czech country manager\", Mr. [REDACTED], who allegedly \"held our hand to make sure we complied with all aspects of the permitting side, including 29(3)\". Tr. (Day 2), 4:17-8:1 (Fraser); Geology Act, Article 29(3) (R-42). Additionally, as the Bardejov police directorate did, the Claimant could also have formally asked the Smilno municipality whether a permit had ever been delivered in relation to the Access Road (see Letter of 3 November 2016 from Smilno Municipality (R-61)).\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimant's argument that at the time nobody suggested to it that the Access Road was privately owned is irreconcilable with the facts. In a weekly report of 20 May 2015, Mr. Crow wrote that AOG was finalizing the lease for the drill site and the \"road use permit\". He added that Mr. Baran would \"work with us and our permit group to get all land owners permission\".781 Once AOG had secured the lease for the drill site,782 Mr. Lewis updated the JV Partners on 25 June 2015 that AOG was \"[w]orking on the road use permit\" and that Mr. Baran would \"work with us and our permit group to get any remaining landowner permissions\".783 Then, after the 21 July 2015 site visit, Mr. Lewis informed his JV Partners on 5 August 2015 that the \"[a]ccess road is a public road\" and that an \"[a]greement between AOG and mayor + land user was done to use and prepare current track\".784 Finally, on 25 August 2015, Mr. Lewis told his JV Partners that \"[a]ll land permits including for the entry road have been received\".785\n\nEmail of 20 May 2015 from Ron Crow (C-424). See also Email of 20 May 2015 from Michael Lewis (C-423). Mr. Fraser stated that Mr. Baran had been \"very supportive\" and that \"he undertook to help us get landowners' permissions\" (Fraser WS1, para. 34).\n\nLease for Smilno well site, 1 June 2015 (C-74); Lease of land for Smilno well site, 15 June 2015 (C-76).\n\nEmail of 24 June 2015 from Mike Lewis to Partners (C-78). The Tribunal further notes that AOG met with the Smilno municipal council on 2 June 2015 to explain its \"proposed plans\" and answer any questions of the council members. According to Mr. Baran, he and the council members \"all agreed that it was not a matter that we could decide on\", since that \"was a matter between AOG, the State *and the owners of the land*\" (emphasis added by the Tribunal). Baran WS, para. 8.\n\nEmail of 5 August 2015 from Michael Lewis, p. 2 (C-281).\n\nPartner Progress Report, 25 August 2015 (C-79).\n\n479.\n\nThe evidence thus makes clear that AOG was aware that it needed \"land owner permission\" to use the Access Road. Leaving aside the inconsistency between the information that the Access Road was a \"public road\" and \"publicly accessible\", and the need to secure a \"permit\", the Claimant's account that it had entered into an agreement with \"mayor + land user\" to \"use and prepare current track\" was strongly refuted by Mr. Baran. The latter repeatedly declared that \"[t]here was not an agreement\".786 He explained: \"But I didn't sign an agreement. I couldn't. You know, the village is not the owner of the road [\u2026]\".787 He also specified that he had not authorized AOG to perform any works on the Access Road: \"I couldn't allow them to do the works\".788\n\nTr. (Day 3), 36:16 (Baran).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 36:20-22 (Baran). See also Tr. (Day 3), 37:4 (Baran). The Tribunal notes in this context that Mr. Fraser first stated that \"it was agreed that there was no issue about using the Road for the purposes of AOG's planned well operations\". At the Hearing, he conceded that the signed 21 July 2015 meeting minutes did not record any agreement and specified that his understanding was that there had been a \"verbal agreement\". Fraser WS2, para. 9; Tr. (Day 2), 125:17-21 (Fraser).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 37:9-15 (Baran).\n\n480.\n\nIt appears to be the case that Mr. Baran said to AOG that the Access Road was a \"public road\",789 which might have created a misunderstanding. However, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he said that \"no permission was required from any person to use the Road\".790 Neither is there a suggestion that a private entity could upgrade a public road, if it was one, without a permit. In any event, a prudent developer would have sought to confirm the mayor's assertion and to ascertain what it meant for its use with heavy machinery \u2013 among other aspects of a basic due diligence.\n\nBaran WS, para. 19; Tr. (Day 3), 37:19-38:1 (Baran) (\"MR DRYMER: The first sentence of that paragraph says: 'Access road is a public road.' A. Yes. MR DRYMER: Do you consider that an accurate statement? A. Yes. MR DRYMER: Okay. Did you express that to them, to AOG at the time? A. Yes\").\n\nAs AOG seems to have concluded (Fraser WS1, para. 35).\n\n481.\n\nThe lack of meaningful due diligence is of particular concern as Mr. Baran apparently told AOG during the 21 July 2015 site visit that the Access Road would have to \"respect[]\" the \"original boundary\" of land plot no. 945.791 In spite of this instruction, AOG levelled the \"last 500 meters or so\" of the track on land plot no. 2721/780.792 Assuming that AOG thought that the track on land plot no. 945 was \"publicly accessible\", it could not reasonably expect to be able to displace the track without prior authorization.\n\nThe meeting minutes read in relevant part as follows: \"The subject of the investigation was the location of the access road on Parcel Type C, Serial No. 945 (unrecorded ownership sheet \u2013 built-up area (road)). Individual comments: Provided that the original boundary of the land, serial number 945 registered as built-up area \u2013 road, will be respected\". Minutes of Meeting, 21 July 2015 (C-280).\n\nThe Claimant explains that, on 19 November 2015, AOG received a report from a surveyor that \"marked out the coordinates of the Smilno Site as well as the '*access road*', the coordinates of which had been based on the '*current cadastral map*'\". The report states that \"[d]emarcation was carried out on the basis of the coordinates supplied by the client of the contract and the current cadastral map\". It is not possible to determine from the coordinates in that report on which land plot the road was to be located, but it is undisputed that AOG relocated that road on land plot no. 2721/780, at least in the last section in proximity to the drill site.

After meeting with the initial resistance from Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 at the beginning of December 2015, AOG sought to purchase a 1/700 ownership share of plot land no. 2721/780.793 The Claimant explained that purchase as a \"backup plan\" to secure \"an additional basis to access the Smilno Site\".794 Whatever the merits of that assertion, the evidence shows that, at the very latest from then on AOG was not only aware that the Access Road was claimed as private property,795 it also began acting in accordance with what it considered to be its rights as one of the owners. AOG's local lawyer, Mr. Slamka, asked Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 on 30 December 2015 to remove her car on the ground that she was \"hindering the co-owner\" from entering and transiting through land plot no. 2721/780.796 Similarly, AOG filed a criminal complaint against Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 on 16 January 2016 alleging a violation of its \"rights as a co-owner of this real property\".797 Moreover, early 2016, AOG sought and obtained the consent of at least one co-owner \"to the use of the field road located on plot no. 2721/780\".798\n\nPurchase Contract, 17 December 2015 (C-105).\n\nReply, para. 57.\n\nAccording to the police report filed by AOG on 14 December 2015, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 parked her car on the Access Road and stretched \"a line\" across the road \"with a sign saying Private property\". Thus, AOG was aware at the latest from that moment onwards that the Access Road was claimed to be private property.

In reality, there were about 170 co-owners.\n\n484.\n\nThereafter, the Claimant again attempted to acquire a share of land plot no. 2721/780. In a report dated 7 March 2016, AOG informed its JV Partners that it intended to buy a share because \"[o]nce we own a legitimate share, we are assured that we can legally remove any blocking cars, and can return to work\".800 For that purpose, in April 2016, AOG created the company Cesty Smilno s.r.o. (or \"Smilno Roads\"), which was to purchase a share of plot no. 2721/780 and lease access to that plot to AOG.801 In the following month, it continued to ask for the consent of other owners.802\n\nStatus Update and Activity Summary, 7 March 2016, p. 1 (R-154).\n\nAOG Status Update, 11 May 2016, p. 1 of the pdf document (C-308) (\"We have now secured an ownership interest in the access road by establishing a new Slovak company which will lease access to Alpine personnel and contractors\").

As noted above, the Respondent mistakenly labelled this exhibit as \"Consent from Mrs. [REDACTED]\" dated 23 May 2016.\n\n485.\n\nIn this context, it is telling that there is no evidence that AOG asserted that the Access Road was a PSPR before April/May 2016. Mr. Fraser explained at the Hearing that the PSPR argument was developed by AOG's new local lawyer, Mr. S\u00fdkora, in the spring of 2016.803 He confirmed to the Tribunal that before then he had not been aware of the concept of \"public special purpose road\".804 Acting on AOG's behalf, Mr. S\u00fdkora first advanced that argument in a request to the municipality of Smilno on 17 May 2016 requesting confirmation that the road was a PSPR which had been used \"by citizens, as well as by a local farmers' cooperative, for decades without any restrictions\".805 This request is the first documentary evidence showing some effort on behalf of the Claimant to ascertain the legal status of the Access Road, which reinforces the lack of earlier due diligence.\n\nMr. Fraser testified that AOG had retained Mr. S\u00fdkora in March or April 2016: \"2016, yes. March, April, I don't recall now. But probably March\". Tr. (Day 2), 17:12-19:3 (Fraser).\n\nTr. (Day 2), 16:12-25 and 17:8-11 (Fraser).\n\nEmail of 17 May 2016 from M. S\u00fdkora to Smilno Municipality (R-155A).\n\n486.\n\nIn conclusion, the record demonstrates that, to the extent that due diligence at such late stage of the project may be relevant at all, the Claimant carried out no meaningful or any due diligence about the legal status of the Access Road before the spring of 2016; that it was aware that the Access Road was situated on private property by 17 December 2015 at the latest; and that it did not allege that the Access Road was a PSPR before May 2016.\n\nSlovak authorities consistently rejected the Claimant's PSPR argument\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nThe competent Slovak authorities, including the mayor of Smilno, the Bardejov district traffic inspectorate, the MoI, and the first instance and appellate courts all rejected the PSPR argument.\n\n488.\n\nAs noted above, AOG first requested information from the mayor of Smilno about the \"nature of the road\" in an email of 17 May 2016.806 That email had two attachments, which the Claimant filed at the Hearing.807 The first attachment is AOG's request for information, which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"We request the provision of the following information:\n\n(i) Is the aforementioned field road a public or non-public special purpose road?\n\n(ii) Is the Town of Smilno the owner of the above-mentioned special purpose road?\n\n(iii) Who conducts the management and maintenance of this special purpose road?\"808\n\nEmail of 17 May 2016 from M. S\u00fdkora to Smilno Municipality (R-155A).\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, the Respondent requested production of the attachments and the Claimant voluntarily provided to the Respondent first a Slovak version of the two attachments and then an English translation, which the Respondent accepted, subject to a \"correction\", and entered into the record as exhibit R-155A. Tr. (Day 2), 21:4-14 (Alexander), 56:6-25 (Tushingham), 58:19-13 (Anway and Tushingham) and 90:18-25 (Tushingham and Alexander).\n\nEmail of 17 May 2016 from M. S\u00fdkora to Smilno Municipality, p. 2 of the pdf document (R-155A).\n\n489.\n\nThe second attachment is a draft provided by AOG for Mr. Baran's suggested use as a template for a response. It reads as follows:\n\n\"Upon reviewing your request, we provide the following statement:\n\n*(i) Is the aforementioned field road a public or non-public special purpose road?*\n\nThe field road located on the land parcel EKN parcel No. 2721/780 in the cadastral area of Smilno is **a public special purpose road.**\n\n*(ii) Is the Town of Smilno the owner of the above-mentioned special purpose road?*\n\nThe Town of Smilno is not the owner of the above-mentioned special purpose road.\n\n*(iii) Who is responsible for the management and maintenance of this special purpose road?*\n\nThe Town of Smilno does not have knowledge of who conducts the management and maintenance of this utility road\".809\n\nEmphasis in the original. Email of 17 May 2016 from M. S\u00fdkora to Smilno Municipality, p. 3 of the pdf document (R-155A).\n\n490.\n\nMr. Baran did not use the template. In his answer of 6 June 2016, he wrote that the Access Road was a \"field track\" (\"*poln\u00e1 cesta*\") that was \"publicly accessible\" considering that it had been \"used by the general public for many decades (100-200 years) as access road to access the adjacent plots of land and a quartz mine\".810 He added that the municipality \"is not the owner of the above mentioned field track\".811 At the Hearing, Mr. Baran testified that he purposefully refrained from qualifying the Access Road as a PSPR.812 He did not carry out any research; he simply \"said it's, as it was\", namely that \"it is called by the local people 'poln\u00e1 cesta', which means field road\".813 He notably added that there were \"no road signs, so it rules out the possibility of being a special purpose road, in spite of the fact that it has been used for a century and it's known among all villagers in Smilno that it's a road\".814\n\nStatement of Smilno municipality regarding the classification of the Road, 6 June 2016, item (i) (R-156).\n\nStatement of Smilno municipality regarding the classification of the Road, 6 June 2016, item (ii) (R-156).\n\nTr.

You did not pick 'local and special-purpose road'; correct? A. That is obviously so, yes\").\n\nTr. (Day 3), 71:22-72:18 (Baran). Because Mr. S\u00fdkora's cover email made reference to a prior telephone conversation with Mr. Baran, he was asked whether the draft response was summarizing any advice he had given to Mr. S\u00fdkora. His response was negative: \"No, I don't recall that. No\". Tr. (Day 3), 68:5-10 (Baran).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 72:18-22 (Baran).\n\n491.\n\nIn other words, Mr. Baran did not espouse or offer support for the PSPR argument. Rather, he indicated that the Access Road was a \"field track\", albeit a publicly accessible one.815\n\nTr. (Day 3), 68:5-10 and 72:25-73:4 (Baran).\n\n492.\n\nFaced with the mayor's response, the Claimant asked local officials to approve the placement of a road sign at the entrance to the Access Road that would have signified that it was a PSPR. While the Smilno municipality proposed to place \"traffic signs P8 and P1\" at the beginning of the Access Road, the Bardejov district traffic inspectorate rejected that proposal on 11 October 2016, determining that the Access Road \"is not a crossroads but merely a conjunction of a country road\".816 Under the Road Traffic Act, a \"cross road\" is \"a place where roads cross or connect\" and \"roads\" are \"motorways, roads, local roads and special purpose roads\".817 Moreover, under the Decree on Traffic Signage, a traffic sign is erected \"to organize, regulate and guide the road traffic\",818 it being recalled that \"road traffic\" regulation under the Road Traffic Act only applies to \"roads\".819 In other words, the traffic inspectorate considered that the Access Road did not qualify as a PSPR or any kind of \"road\".\n\nLetter of 11 October 2016 sent by the Police to the Smilno municipality, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-153).\n\nRoad Traffic Act, Articles 2(1) and 2(2)(j) (C-214 and R-174).\n\nDecree of Ministry of Interior No. 30/2020 Coll., on Traffic Signage, as amended, Article 1(1) (R-173).\n\nRoad Traffic Act, Articles 1 and 2(1) (C-214 and R-174).\n\n493.\n\nThereafter, on 26 October 2016, Mr. Fraser met with the official from the Bardejov inspectorate, Mr. [REDACTED] , the civil engineer who had made the 11 October 2016 determination, and a police officer. Mr. Fraser reported to Mr. Lewis that Mr. [REDACTED] confirmed that he \"was not prepared to agree that the track could be a special purpose road\".820 Mr. Fraser then relayed that \"[w]e threatened them with litigation if they failed to keep the track open and told them we were going to go ahead anyway\", adding that \"[w]e have decided to try and fence the whole track if possible. If not, we will put a gate across the entrance to the track\", and further stating that fencing would start the following week.821 Whatever one thinks of Mr. Fraser's email, the idea of fencing or gating a track is hardly reconcilable with a PSPR.\n\nEmail of 26 October 2016 from Mr. Fraser (C-340).\n\nEmail of 26 October 2016 from Mr. Fraser (C-340).\n\n494.\n\nThe PSPR argument was also rejected by the MoI in a letter it wrote on 19 December 2016 to the regional traffic inspectorate in Pre\u0161ov in response to the latter's request for guidance about the Access Road on land plot no. 2721/780 and \"in relation to the interpretation and assessment of the terms 'track/rural road' ('*po\u013en\u00e1 cesta*), 'public road' (*verejn\u00e1 komunik\u00e1cia*), and 'public special purpose road' (*verejn\u00e1 \u00fa\u010delov\u00e1 komunik\u00e1cia*)\".822 After recalling the MoT's position that a track or forest road is a special purpose road if it is included in the \"special purpose roads passport\", has been built with a permit, is registered as such in the Land Registry or special survey real estate-related documentation, or is registered \"in a different registry\" such as a registry held by the owner or administrator of forest land, the MoI opined that the Access Road was not a PSPR:\n\n\"The Ministry of Interior agrees with your legal opinion based on the fact that if the Smilno municipality does not have available any documentation evidencing the existence of a road on land plot with Parcel No. 2721/780 in the Smilno Real Estate Registration Area, and no other documentation evidencing the existence of such road exists, *then the road in question is not a special purpose road* and must be seen as private land the public use of which is not justified by any tangible evidence, and therefore it is not possible to carry out traffic supervision on such land despite the consent granted by its owners.\n\nAccording to the information we have procured, the plot of land in question is private land with several co-owners [\u2026]\".823\n\nEmphasis in the original.

In early 2017, the District Court of Bardejov and the Regional Court of Pre\u0161ov denied AOG's request to enjoin Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 and others from restricting AOG's access to the Access Road.824 That request was premised on AOG's claim that it had \"the right to use the access field road\" because it had secured the consent of a majority of co-owners or alternatively because the Access Road was a PSPR. The appellate court held that the first claim was unproven,825 and did not rule on the second. Rather, it held that, even if the Access Road were a PSPR, its technical condition was not suitable for AOG's planned purposes:\n\n\"If the claimant [AOG] claims that the access field road is a public special purpose road, it is necessary to point to the fact that the Communications Act puts certain restrictions on the roads use. *When using a road, users must adjust themselves to the construction-technical condition of the road which the appellate court does not perceive as fulfilled in this case* with regard to the field road condition (it is a relatively narrow road in the middle of arable land, paved with gravel) and the *weight and size of machines and motor vehicles needed for geological deposit exploration*. In addition, use of a road the construction-technical condition of which is not suitable for the requested traffic may lead to fine which means that it is unlawful action that would have been affirmed by the court had the court issued an immediate injunction\".826\n\nResolution of the Regional Court Pre\u0161ov, File No. 20Co/14/2017-256, 16 February 2017 (R-59).

As noted above, the Tribunal concludes that the Slovak Republic did not generate any legitimate expectation that Discovery and AOG could drill at Smilno. Even if such an expectation existed, however, the evidence before the Tribunal shows that the Slovak Republic did not fail to honor any such expectation. As mentioned earlier, the following analysis is conducted for completeness only.\n\n**(iii) Even if the Slovak Republic had created any legitimate expectations, it did not frustrate them**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Claimant complains about the following measures:827\n\n\u2022 the police refused to remove the cars parked by Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 and other persons on the Access Road in December 2015, January, June and November 2016 (\"Measure # 1\");\n\n\u2022 the Bardejov District Court improperly enjoined AOG from accessing the Access Road (\"Measure # 2\");\n\n\u2022 the Presov Regional Court refused to overturn the district court's interim injunction (\"Measure # 3\");\n\n\u2022 the prosecutor improperly intervened in AOG's \"civil dispute\" with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 in relation to the interim injunction (\"Measure # 4\");\n\n\u2022 the prosecutor instructed the police to cancel its policing operation on 18 June 2016 (\"Measure # 5\");\n\n\u2022 the police refused to approve the road signage scheme that would have clarified that the Access Road was a public road or a PSPR (\"Measure # 6\"); and\n\n\u2022 the Mol improperly instructed the police that the Access Road was not a PSPR (\"Measure # 7\").\n\nMemorial, paras. 227-231; Reply, paras. 3(1) and 291-298; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 52 and 158.\n\n499.\n\nWhile the Claimant did not explicitly contend that the judiciary's conduct frustrated its legitimate expectations (measures ## 2-3),828 it claimed that it expected to carry out its exploration \"without *any other relevant organ* of the Slovak State objecting\".829 Since the Interim Injunction was issued by the judiciary, the Tribunal will deal with measures ## 2-3 in this section. The Claimant also contends that measures ## 2 and 3 amount to a denial of justice, a claim to which the Tribunal will revert (see paragraphs 656 to 663). Importantly in this context, the Claimant conceded at the Hearing that, if the Tribunal were to find that the Interim Injunction did not breach a treaty standard, then the other claims in relation to Smilno would fall away, except for those relating to the EIAs.830\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 158.\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.

(Day 2), 134:12-20 (Fraser) (\"We were appalled.

MR TUSHINGHAM: We completely accept that\").\n\n500.\n\nAs stated above, the Claimant could at best expect to drill at Smilno only if it had first conducted a sufficient exercise in due diligence and complied with the applicable law and the license conditions. The review of the facts above has established that the Claimant does not meet the first condition. The following discussion will demonstrate that it does not meet the second condition either.\n\nCompliance with the law\n-----------------------\n\n501.\n\nAs noted above, under Article 29 of the Geology Act, the Claimant and AOG had to secure consent from the owners or an order from the MoE to access private property.831 In addition, as is common ground, under Articles 13(4) and 2(4)(b) of the Geology Act and 2 and 5a of the Mining Activities Act, the Claimant and AOG had to notify the District Mining Office eight days prior to the start of exploration activities, including \"technical work, in particular drilling\".832 Under the Road Act, the Claimant and AOG also had to take account of the technical condition of the Access Road and obtain owner consent for upgrades.833\n\nGeology Act, Article 29 (R-42). This obligation was expressly stated in the 2010 license renewal (Decision about extension of the geological survey permit (Svidn\u00edk), Ref. No.: 44505/2010, File No.: 998/2010-9.3, 26 July 2010, p. 7 of the pdf document, para. 2.6 (C-5)).\n\nGeology Act, Articles 2(4)(b) and 13(4) (R-42); Act No. 51/1988 Coll. on Mining Activities, as amended, Articles 2 and 5a(4) (R-44).

See further Counter-Memorial, para. 33; Reply, para. 14.\n\nRoad Act, Articles 6(1) and 19(1) (R-158 and R-175).\n\n502.\n\nThe Claimant and AOG complied with none of these obligations. AOG did not request permission to use the Access Road prior to the first drilling attempts in December 2015 and January 2016. As the Access Road was a private field track co-owned by around 170 owners, either the consent of the owners or an access order from the MoE was required.834 AOG had neither and thus contravened Article 29 of the Geology Act when it attempted to access the drill site on 6 December 2015 and later. AOG did not notify the mining authority in due time, with the result that it was fined EUR 2,000 for that failure.835 And AOG did not adjust to the technical condition of the Access Road when it drove its heavy machinery to the well site.836\n\nUnder Article 139(2) of the Slovak Civil Code, the co-owners exercise their management rights through decisions \"by the majority of votes calculated on the basis of the size of their shares\" and, in case of equal votes or the failure to reach a majority decision or an agreement, the decision is rendered by the courts upon application \"of any of the co-owners\".

See Lewis WS2, para. 22(f).\n\nFraser WS1, para. 35; Varjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 19.\n\n503.\n\nIn addition to the public law obligations just discussed, the Claimant and AOG also had to respect the property rights of the owners of the Access Road. The evidence indicates that they failed to comply with those rights, resorted to self-help instead of engaging with the owners or seeking appropriate remedy and did not observe the co-owners' right of first refusal. This conduct ultimately resulted in the Interim Injunction issued by the court, which restrained AOG (and any third party associated with AOG) from using the Access Road pending the resolution of its dispute with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 about the validity of AOG's purchase of a share of the Access Road.\n\n504.\n\nThe evidence establishes the following sequence of events. Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 first parked a car (a green Renault) at the entrance of the Access Road on 14 December 2015, and put her telephone number on the front window.837 She also placed \"plastic poles and a string with signaling flags\" with \"an information sign saying Private Property\".838 AOG did not call her; it removed the plastic poles, continued levelling the drill site and filed a police report requesting \"the offender to be held accountable\".839 Then, according to Mr. Fraser, \"[o]n about 17 December 2015, a \"heavily dented small white Fiat van\" blocked the Access Road.840 AOG did not try to return to the site until the following month. Instead, on the same day as the Fiat van appeared, it purported to buy a 1/700 share of land plot no. 2721/780 and, on 31 December 2015, AOG's lawyer sent Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 a cease-and-desist letter.841\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 20; Lewis WS1, para. 55; Fraser WS1, para. 36.\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 19; Email from [REDACTED] to AOG team with attached Police reports, 14 December 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-102).\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 20; Fraser WS1, para. 36; Email from [REDACTED] to AOG team with attached Police reports, 14 December 2015, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-102).\n\nFraser WS1, para. 37; Photograph of White car, 17 December 2015 (C-106).\n\nPurchase Contract, 17 December 2015 (C-105); Letter of 30 December 2015 from Law Office Slamka to Mrs. Varjanov\u00e1 (R-36).

It repeatedly moved Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's van, twice cut the chain attaching the vehicle to the ground and even put concrete blocks around it. This conduct is surprising considering that AOG told its JV Partners on 20 January 2016 that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 has a \"legal right to park her car on the road\".849 At the Hearing, Mr. Fraser had difficulty explaining AOG's antagonizing of Ms. Varjanov\u00e1, rather than contacting her,850 or, if it truly believed that it was a co-owner of the Access Road, acting to resolve its disagreements with other owners by seeking appropriate relief in the competent court, before taking matters into its own hands.851 As the District Court in Bardejov would eventually opine, having recourse to self-help in these circumstances is \"inadmissible\" if it involves one co-owner interfering with \"the rights of other co-owners\" or damaging \"the rights or things belonging to the other co-owners without a legal reason\".852\n\nReport to Partners \u2013 Status Update, 20 January 2016, p. 2 (C-120).\n\nTr.

AOG filed a criminal complaint against Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 on 16 January 2016, alleging that she was violating AOG's \"rights as a co-owner\" to use the Access Road.853 Noting that the \"extract of ownership certificate no. 1367\" showed that AOG had \"a co-ownership share in the parcel at issue, in a portion of 1/700\" and that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 had a 1/210 co-ownership share over the same parcel, the police concluded that \"both parties have a co-ownership share on this parcel\", with the consequence that this was a property dispute over which the civil courts had jurisdiction.854\n\nSee Resolution of the District Police Department Bardejov, 15 February 2016 (R-150).\n\nThe police held as follows: \"Only the relevant court is competent to resolve the property relationship and to decide on legitimacy of entitlements of the specific persons to the specific parcels of land\". Resolution of the District Police Department Bardejov, 15 February 2016, p. 2 (R-150).\n\n508.\n\nIn turn, on 19 January 2016, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 filed a motion asking the District Court in Bardejov to annul AOG's purchase of a 1/700 share on the ground that the sale breached the pre-emptive rights of the other co-owners. She also requested an interim injunction restraining AOG from using the Access Road and removing things placed on the road pending the resolution of the motion.855 In her request, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 argued that AOG was resorting to self-help and usurping the management rights of the co-owners.856 The District Court in Bardejov granted the Interim Injunction on 18 February 2016 and the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov upheld that decision on appeal about two months later.857\n\nThe request for relief reads as follows: \"The first defendant is obliged to refrain from using the real property registered in the Land Register in Ownership Certificate No. 1367 for the cadastral territory Smilno, municipality Smilno, Bardejov District as a lot of land of the 'E' Register No. 2721/780, arable land with an area of 11,660 m2, until the final closure of the proceedings to determine the invalidity of the purchase contract concluded between the first defendant as the buyer and [REDACTED] as the seller, on 28 December 2015,  \nthe entry of which into the Land Register was permitted under file no. V 2604/2015.  \nThe first defendant is obliged to refrain from removing things placed by the plaintiff on the property registered in the Land Register in Ownership Certificate No. 1367 for the cadastral territory Smilno, municipality Smilno, District Bardejov as a lot of land of the 'E' Register No. 2721/780, arable land with an area of 11,660 m2 both by himself and through third parties, until the final closure of the proceedings to determine the invalidity of the purchase contract concluded between the first defendant as the buyer and [REDACTED] as the seller, on 28 December 2015, the entry of which into the Land Register was permitted under file no. V 2604/2015\". Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's request for an interim injunction, 19 January 2016, p. 2 of the pdf document (MS-5).\n\nThe motivation for the request reads in relevant part as follows: \"Despite the fact that, as is clear from the motion to commence the proceedings, the first defendant has a 1/700 share in the relevant common property, his supposed right to use the property, according to his ideas, he not only claims with the attached letter, but repeatedly uses self-help, and without anything authorizing him to do so, removes from the relevant property the motor vehicle that the plaintiff has on rent. Despite the fact that the plaintiff has repeatedly turned to the police in this regard without immediate intervention by the court, she cannot prevent the first defendant, either alone or through third parties, from repeatedly physically manipulating the motor vehicle that the plaintiff has on rent, and for the condition of which the plaintiff is responsible. In case of repeated removal of the said motor vehicle, there is also a risk of its damage. The plaintiff has the consent of several co-owners with her procedure in using the relevant lot of land. [\u2026] The relevant contract is invalid. Since, despite this fact, the first defendant seeks the exercise of his right of ownership, primarily to use the property in a way that is contrary to the law, since the 1/700 share in common property does not authorize him to make decisions about the management, and thus also the use of the thing, and his claims having no basis in applicable law, are applied by the first defendant by self-help, in which there is a risk of damage, it is necessary for the court to temporarily adjust the relations of the parties to the proceedings\".

To the extent measures ## 2 and 3 deal with these allegations, the Tribunal will address those measures at this juncture.\n\n511.\n\nBy issuing the Interim Injunction, the Bardejov District Court ordered AOG and any third party authorized by AOG to refrain from using the Access Road and from removing property items which Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 had placed on that road pending the resolution of the dispute about the validity of AOG's purchase of the 1/700 share.859\n\nThe court held as follows: \"In view of the above, it is appropriate that the first defendant should not use the property, nor interfere with the rights of the applicant, until the issue of his ownership right and the issue of whether the legal act has not infringed the rights of the other co-owner \u2013 the applicant, are resolved. In the statement of the law, the court did not state that the ban on removing things applies to the first defendant and third parties, as this follows from the very essence of the imposition of the obligation to 'refrain' from using the property and removing things from it. This obligation is directed both to the first defendant, as well as to persons authorized by him, who would possibly derive the right of entry or use of the property only from his rights, or they would thus act arbitrarily, which is inadmissible\". The operative part of the decision provides in relevant part: The Court orders a preliminary measure as follows: \"The first defendant **is obliged to refrain** from using the real property registered in the Land Register [\u2026] and to **refrain** from removing things placed by the plaintiff on the property registered in the Land Register [\u2026]. This preliminary measure will last until the final determination of the proceedings conducted by the local court under file no. 1C/29/2016\" (emphasis in the original). Decision of the Bardejov District Court, 18 February 2016, pp. 1 and 7-8 (C-125).\n\n512.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the first instance and appellate courts lacked jurisdiction over the injunction, that their decisions were arbitrary because the conditions for an injunction were not met, and that the courts were biased against AOG.860 The Claimant also raises one additional argument in relation to the Interim Injunction to which the Tribunal will revert in the context of the denial of justice claim.\n\nMemorial, paras. 228-229; Reply, paras. 81-82 and 343-348.\n\n513.\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal notes that investment tribunals should give some degree of deference to the national courts' assessment, application and interpretation of national law, and only step in if there is some \"severe impropriety\", to use the wording of *Jan de Nul*.861 The Tribunal sees no evidence of any such impropriety here.\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008 (hereinafter \"*Jan de Nul v. Egypt*\"), para. 206 (CL-29).\n\n514.\n\nMore specifically, regarding jurisdiction, the Claimant relies on its legal expert, Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek.862 The core of Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek's opinion is that the Bardejov District Court lacked jurisdiction because civil courts have no jurisdiction over public roads.863 He insisted that the district and regional courts should have assessed their jurisdiction and investigated the legal status of the Access Road *ex officio*, and that had they done so they should have declined jurisdiction. The difficulty with this opinion is that it is premised on the understanding that the Access Road is a public road or a PSPR. At the Hearing, Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek accepted that if his understanding in this regard were mistaken, the Bardejov District Court would be competent.864 It is also noteworthy that AOG never objected before the appellate court that the courts lacked jurisdiction on the ground that the Access Road was a public road or a PSPR. Rather, AOG invoked its purported ownership rights and never argued that the dispute was not a private law dispute.865 Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's contention that the Bardejov District Court and, by implication, the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court improperly assumed jurisdiction over the Interim Injunction.866\n\nMemorial, para. 228(2); Reply, para. 346.\n\n\u0160tev\u010dek ER1, para. 27; \u0160tev\u010dek ER2, paras. 5.1, 9 and 46.1; Tr. (Day 4), 57:1-4 (\u0160tev\u010dek); Tr. (Day 4), 73:6-21 (\u0160tev\u010dek). The tenor of his argument was that the municipality had the prime competence to determine the existence of a PSPR (together with the MoT which could render non-binding interpretations) and that the municipality is the body which knows best the \"local conditions\" (Tr. (Day 4), 31:16-21 and 96:6-14 (\u0160tev\u010dek)). As already noted, the municipality of Smilno had rejected AOG's PSPR argument on 6 June 2016 (Statement of the Smilno municipality regarding the classification of the Road, 6 June 2016 (C-18)).\n\nTr. (Day 4), 57:5-9 (\u0160tev\u010dek) (Q. Now, assuming, just for the purposes of my question, assuming that the field road in Smilno was not a public special purpose road, would the district court have jurisdiction to issue the injunction? A. Yes).\n\nAppeal of company AOG against the decision of District Court Bardejov, 2 March 2017, p. 3 of the pdf document (LF-17).\n\nMoreover, since Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek, who is a civil lawyer, repeatedly insisted at the Hearing that he is no expert in road law or administrative law, it is unclear to the Tribunal how he reached his conclusion that the Access Road necessarily was a PSPR, even going so far as to say that the Slovak legislator had committed mistakes, for instance, when distinguishing PSPRs from field tracks or forest roads in Article 21 of the Road Traffic Act. Tr. (Day 4), 26:23-24, 26:10, 32:18-21, 47:12-14 and 49:21-22 (\u0160tev\u010dek).\n\n515.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the statutory requirement of the existence of a risk of \"significant, serious and even irreparable harm\" was not satisfied and hence the Interim Injunction should not have been issued.867 It adds that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's \"unlawful\" blocking of the Access Road \"disentitled\" her from obtaining the Interim Injunction and that the injunction did not aim at protecting her from losing her pre-emption right.868\n\nMemorial, para. 228(1); Reply, para. 345.\n\nMemorial, para. 228(3)-(4), Reply, para. 347.\n\n516.\n\nIt is generally accepted that one of the purposes of interim measures is to preserve the rights of the litigants during the proceedings and to avoid any aggravation of the dispute. The injunction restraining AOG from using the Access Road during the pendency of the civil law dispute with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 served only this limited purpose. It regulated the exercise of the parties' alleged rights during the proceedings and was meant to avoid any aggravation of the dispute.\n\n517.\n\nThis general perspective is confirmed when one reviews the applicable requirements under Slovak law. Article 75(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure requires *inter alia* that the applicant demonstrate the likelihood of a \"risk of imminent harm\".869 In reference to that provision, the Bardejov District Court stressed the conditions of necessity and urgency to avoid the occurrence of \"immediate\" or \"imminent\" harm, as well as the element of proportionality and the need to balance the respective rights of the litigants.870 Based on the evidence before it, the Bardejov District Court was satisfied that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 had shown the existence of a risk of immediate harm to her rights as owner of the car that AOG was repeatedly removing through self-help and to her rights as co-owner of the Access Road, such that interim measures were appropriate.871 As noted above, the court added that resort to self-help was generally \"inadmissible\" and would be avoided through the imposition of an injunction.872 The Pre\u0161ov Regional Court likewise held that it was necessary and urgent to maintain the Interim Injunction because of the risk of imminent harm.873\n\nArticle 75(2) reads as follows: \"[T]he petition shall include a description of the decisive facts justifying the ordering of the interim measure, the statement of conditions of eligibility of the claim to which the interim protection is to be provided, and the reasoning of the risk of imminent harm\". Act No. 99/1963 Coll., the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended, Article 75(2) (LF-4).\n\n\"The prerequisite for the issue of a preliminary measure is the existence of an unavoidable need to temporarily adjust the conditions of the parties before the decision on the case itself. The precondition for satisfying the proposal is also the urgency of the situation that requires an urgent solution of the case to prevent the occurrence of damage, if any. As a result, the court decides on the proposal to order a preliminary measure on the basis of the certification of the asserted facts, while the relevant proof as regards showing the existence of such a right is only carried out in the judicial proceedings. The prerequisite for the court to be able to satisfy the proposal for a preliminary measure is that the plaintiff must at least certify the basic facts necessary for the conclusion about the probability of the claim to be granted preliminary protection as well as certification of the urgency of the need for a temporary adjustment of relations between the parties. Thus, the court orders a preliminary measure only if it is necessary to temporarily adjust the conditions of the parties to the proceedings and there is a risk of causing immediate damage. The nature of the preliminary measure shows that the claim does not have to be proved without doubt, but it needs to be proven. The degree of certification is governed by the situation, primarily by the urgency of the solution. [\u2026] The preliminary measure is admissible and justified if: a/ it is claimed and certified that there are legal relations between the parties, b/ these legal relations require temporary adjustment, c/ this temporary adjustment is necessary, d/ there is no irreversible condition in the legal relations between the parties, e/ the legal relations between the parties are not interfered with in an unreasonable manner. The court must consider whether, as a result of the preliminary measure, disproportionate damage will be caused to one of the parties to the proceedings. With a preliminary measure, someone can be limited in the exercise of their rights only to the necessary extent or temporarily\". Decision of the Bardejov District Court, 18 February 2016, p. 5-7 (C-125).\n\n\"[I]n this case it is appropriate that, de facto, before the resolution of the question of the ownership right to the real property of the first defendant on the basis of the action filed for the relative invalidity of the legal act \u2013 the purchase contract dated 17 December 2015 (No. V 2604/2015) the relations between the parties to the proceedings are temporarily adjusted in order to prevent possible damage to the applicant consisting in damage to her entrusted property, or her rights arising from joint ownership. [\u2026] In view of the above, it is appropriate that the first defendant should not use the property, nor interfere with the rights of the applicant, until the issue of his ownership right and the issue of whether the legal act has not infringed the rights of the other co-owner \u2013 the applicant, are resolved\". Decision of the Bardejov District Court, 18 February 2016, p. 7 (C-125).\n\nDecision of the Bardejov District Court, 18 February 2016, p. 7 (C-125).\n\n\"After examining the case, the Court of Appeal takes the view that, in the present case, both on the basis of the contents of the file and on the applicant's arguments, there is a proven urgency to order interim measures. In the interim measure, the claimant must certify, in addition to the existence of a claim, that without the interim measure, the possible future enforcement of the decision would be at risk, while the risk of thwarting the enforcement of the decision must be real and must be imminent [\u2026]\". Resolution of the Regional Court in Pre\u0161ov, Case Number 22Co/66/2016, 14 April 2016, p. 5 (C-17).\n\n518.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there is nothing to indicate that both courts did anything other than properly apply the applicable standard under Slovak law, and that their reasoning sufficiently indicated why, in their considered view, interim measures were appropriate in the circumstances. The Parties' legal experts mainly disagreed on the level of risk or harm required for such a finding. Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek advocates a stringent test implying \"significant, serious and even irreparable harm\".874 Even assuming this were the correct test, the use of the words \"and even\" suggests that a risk that does not rise to the level of irreparable harm may suffice. Moreover, Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek did not say that there was no risk of serious, significant or irreparable harm in this case. His opinion was rather that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's conduct should deprive her of protection and he accepted that the condition of imminent harm would be met \"if the applicant herself did not violate the law\".875 Since the Access Road was not a PSPR, in the view of the Tribunal, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 had not breached the law and the expert's conclusion falls away. It is also noteworthy that, on appeal to the Regional Court, AOG did not argue that the Bardejov District Court misapplied the \"imminent harm\" standard or that there was no such harm present. Although AOG asserted that there was no urgency or necessity, nowhere did it allege the lack of \"imminent\", \"serious\" or \"irreparable\" harm.876\n\n\u0160tev\u010dek ER1, paras. 12-16 and 22-23; \u0160tev\u010dek ER2, paras. 12-16 and 20-21; Foga\u0161 ER2, paras. 36-39; Tr. (Day 4) 66:24-72:20 (\u0160tev\u010dek) and 112:12-132:11 (Foga\u0161). Each expert sought to find support for his position in various decisions of the Slovak Supreme Court that variably refer to \"imminent harm\" and to \"significant, serious and even irreparable harm\". For the first proposition, see Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, File No. 4Obo 89/2012, 26 November 2012 (LF-10) (\"Even the interim injunction cannot be granted solely on the basis of applicant's statements without certifying at least basic facts allowing the conclusion about probability of the claim, which should be protected and without certifying imminent harm\"); Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, File No. 6M Cdo 5/2012, 28 November 2012 (LF-11) (\"However, it is necessary to have at least the basic facts evidenced that are necessary for the conclusion on probability of the interest that should be given preliminary protection as well as evidencing that justified concern about imminent harm or danger to future execution of a judgment exists\"). For the second proposition, see Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, File No. 4 Obdo 30/2010, 29 April 2011 (MS-3) (\"The applicant must declare the grounds for the claim in the merits of the case and thus have locus standi to bring the application. The applicant has the burden of proof as to the facts demonstrating that there is a reason for the injunction and also has the burden of proof as to the facts justifying the proposed injunction. This means that the applicant must certify that, without an injunction, significant, serious and even irreparable harm could occur\"); Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic, File No. 1 M Cdo 2/2011, 23 May 2012 (MS-2) (\"It follows from the provisions of Article 75 par. 2 of the CCP governing the requirements of a motion for an interim injunction that one of the preconditions for granting the interim injunction is that the applicant justifies the threat of imminent harm to the applicant. This means that the applicant must certify that, without an injunction, significant, serious and even irreparable harm could be caused to the applicant\"). The Tribunal was not persuaded by either expert's explanations about the respective relevance of the decisions each expert referred to. While the decisions invoked by Dr. Foga\u0161 postdate those invoked by Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek, even if only by a few months, it is also true that the decision of the Supreme Court of 23 May 2012 mentions both standards saying that the risk of \"imminent harm\" meant a showing of a risk of \"significant, serious and even irreparable harm\".\n\n\u0160tev\u010dek ER1, paras. 22-23; \u0160tev\u010dek ER2, para. 20.\n\nAppeal of company AOG against the decision of District Court Bardejov, 2 March 2016, pp. 2-5 of the pdf document (LF-17).\n\n519.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal fails to see any arbitrariness or bias on the part of the courts, or that the contrary view is even arguable. In particular, contrary to Mr. Fraser's insinuation at the Hearing, there is no indication in the record that the courts were subject to political pressure \"or some similar influence\".877 Even Prof. \u0160tev\u010dek resoundingly rejected any such suggestion, adding that in his view the appellate judges had exercised independent and impartial judgment.878\n\nTr. (Day 2), 148:8-17 (Fraser).\n\nTr. (Day 4), 75:7-18 (\u0160tev\u010dek).\n\n520.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Interim Injunction was properly issued and upheld on appeal. The decisions of the first instance and appellate courts were neither arbitrary nor do they denote any bias against AOG. Thus, subject to its further assessment below of the denial of justice claim, the Tribunal finds that measures ## 2 and 3 did not breach a treaty standard.\n\n521.\n\nConsidering that there was nothing whatsoever that was improper about the Interim Injunction, it is clear that the Claimant failed to abide by it when AOG subsequently attempted to drill at Smilno in June and November 2016. Mr. Fraser acknowledged that the Interim Injunction was then still in force and that AOG therefore could not use the Access Road.879 Moreover, as seen above, the Interim Injunction also applied to third parties authorized by AOG.\n\nTr. (Day 2), 64:9-13, 70:16-19, 77:12-14, 87:8-10, 112:18-25 and 134:21-135:5 (Fraser). See also Tr. (Day 2), 185:4-23 (Lewis).\n\n522.\n\nThe first thing AOG did in an effort to circumvent the Interim Injunction was to create Cesty Smilno/Smilno Roads in April 2016 for the purpose of acquiring another share in the Access Road to allow AOG to use the track.880 It did so with the expectation that owning a \"legitimate share\" would allow it to \"legally remove any blocking cars\" and \"return to work\".881 The Claimant's explanation that it was Cesty Smilno which accessed the drill site not AOG does not assist it as Cesty Smilno was essentially AOG's alter ego.882\n\nAs Mr. Fraser confirmed, it had the same management as AOG, no employees of its own, took directions from AOG and was under the full control of AOG.883 Any doubt on this aspect is extinguished with the confirmation that Discovery hired and paid GMT Projekt to \"upgrade\" the Access Road, not Cesty Smilno.884\n\nThe scheme involved having one co-owner, Mr. [REDACTED] contribute his share of the Access Road to Cesty Smilno.

(Day 2), 77:17-25 (Fraser).\n\n523.\n\nIt is also striking that AOG began to upgrade the Access Road on 7 June 2016, the day after Mr. Baran had refused to accept AOG's PSPR argument and clarified that the Access Road was no more than a \"field track\".885 Notwithstanding, AOG proceeded to gravel the Access Road and moved its drilling equipment to the site between 16 and 18 June 2016.886 In addition to breaching the Interim Injunction and the Geology Act, the upgrade was done without the consent of the land owners and was thus in manifest violation of Article 19 of the Road Act. Finally, although Mr. Fraser stated that, on 16 June 2016, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's \"boyfriend\" had driven his car into Mr. Crow, AOG's Chief Operating Officer, allegedly causing him to \"suffer bruising and some cuts\",887 the video of the scene appears to show Mr. Crow mocking the protestors and rather obviously faking the claim that he had been injured.888\n\nStatement of Smilno municipality regarding the classification of the Road, 6 June 2016 (R-156).\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that AOG drilled a 21-meter deep conductor hole. In this connection, although the Respondent did not raise that point, there is no evidence in the record indicating that AOG notified the mining office 8 days before its second drilling attempt, as it should have under Article 13(4) of the Geology Act. See Geology Act, Articles 2(4)(b) and 13(4) (R-42); Act No. 51/1988 Coll. on Mining Activities, as amended, Articles 2 and 5a(4) (R-44).\n\nPhotograph of Ron Crow, June 2016 (C-112); Fraser WS1, para. 55.\n\nVideorecording of Mr. Crow's incident (R-37).\n\n524.\n\nFinally, the same breaches occurred again on the occasion of AOG's third drilling attempt between 15 and 17 November 2016.\n\n525.\n\nRather unsurprisingly, the Claimant's conduct generated increasing opposition from land owners and local residents, as well as other citizens and activists, which started to attract media attention. Whereas Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 was alone in blocking the Access Road in December 2015, by January 2016 she had mobilized other protestors and attracted a camera crew from TV Joj.889 By June 2016, Mr. Fraser estimates that there were between 20 and 25 protestors (between 30 and 50 according to Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1) blocking the Access Road or otherwise protesting AOG's activities by creating a \"human chain\".890 A similar number of protestors showed up in November 2016 again with reporters from TV Joj.891\n\nFraser WS1, para. 41.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 53; Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS1, para. 13; Varjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 35; Varjanov\u00e1 WS2, para. 24.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 70.\n\n526.\n\nThe risk of opposition of civil society against the drilling project was foreseeable since the summer of 2015. On 16 June 2015, AOG convened a town hall meeting that was attended by 80 to 100 persons, according to Mr. Baran, \"a very significant turn-out\".892 Although Messrs. Lewis and Baran thought that the meeting was \"generally\" \"positive\" and that a \"majority\" \"did not object to AOG's plans\",893 Mr. Le\u0161ko testified that in his view the \"information provided to the local inhabitants was unilateral, simplified and incomplete\",894 and Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 similarly stated that AOG \"did not help to dispel\" the \"doubts and worries\" the local inhabitants had in relation to drilling.895 Thereafter she and a few other residents organized a petition expressing disagreement with AOG's plans.896 A majority of local residents over the age of 15 signed that petition (330 out of 613, i.e. 54%),897 which was then adopted by the Smilno municipal council on 23 July 2015 (four votes in favor, one vote against and no abstention).898 If anything, this result should have given the Claimant pause to reflect on how it might better address the concerns of a large segment of the local population. The failure to do so, coupled with the lack of meaningful due diligence about the Access Road, and the repeated breaches of the law discussed above, largely explain why the Claimant ultimately failed to drill a well in Smilno.\n\nInvitation to the municipal public meeting in Smilno, 16 June 2015 (R-17); Baran WS, para. 11.\n\nEmail of 24 June from Mike Lewis to Partners, p. 1 (C-78); Baran WS, paras. 12-13.\n\nLe\u0161ko WS1, para. 22.\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS2, para. 6.\n\nThe petition reads as follows: \"We, the undersigned residents, disagree with the activities related to exploration area 'Svidn\u00edk \u2013 Oil and Combustible Natural Gas' that with their consequences have an impact on the environment in municipality Smilno. We therefore request that the Municipal Council of Smilno and the mayor of Smilno express their **disapproval of exploration area 'Svidn\u00edk \u2013 Oil and Flammable Natural Gas'** as well as of all the geological works in the exploration area and related activities that intervene in or have an impact on the environment in Smilno\". Emphasis in the original. Signature Sheets (R-107); Resolution of the Smilno Municipal Council, 23 July 2015 (R-15).\n\nThe Respondent put to Mr. Baran that 341 persons had signed the petition and Mr. Baran responded that \"23 out of this petition were not Smilno inhabitants\" and \"like maybe 20 were under the age of 18, or 15, so yes\". After going through those numbers, Mr. Baran agreed with the Respondent's counsel that 318 Smilno inhabitants constituted a majority: \"Q. So if 318 signed, that actually is an absolute majority; correct? A. Correct\". A review of the signature pages shows that 347 persons signed the petition and that 330 persons resided in Smilno (2 persons only indicated their house number, i.e. \"108\", and not their location, but the Tribunal understands that they too resided in Smilno, since the following signature comes from house number \"107\" in Smilno). This corresponds to Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's statement that \"54% of Smilno's residents over 15 years of age\" had signed the petition (330/613 = 54%). Even if one were to accept Mr. Baran's representation that \"maybe 20\" persons were under the age of 15, something the Claimant has not shown to be true, this would still amount to 310 persons (or 308 if one excludes the residents in house no. 108) and thus a majority out of the 613 Smilno inhabitants above the age of 15. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Baran confirmed that he knew these people, recognized their names and that he had no reason to believe they did not sign the petition.

In line with its previous approach, it will nevertheless briefly address these matters as a further alternative reasoning.\n\nTr. (Day 6), 80:8-13 (Tushingham).\n\nThe disputed measures\n---------------------\n\n528.\n\nThe Claimant complains that, in December 2015 and January 2016, the police refused to remove either Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's vehicle or disperse the activists who were blocking the Access Road.900 It raises the same complaint in respect of events in June and November 2016.901\n\nMemorial, paras. 89-93, 227 and 231; Reply, paras. 77-80 and 295.\n\nMemorial, paras. 102-108, 127-128, 227 and 231; Reply, paras. 86-97, 113-115 and 295.\n\n529.\n\nTo recall what has been described above, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 first parked her green Renault at the entrance of the Access Road on 14 December 2015, at the time of the first drilling attempt, which prompted AOG to file a police report requesting \"the offender to be held accountable\".902 The police came on site on 17 and 18 December 2015, at which time a white Fiat van was blocking the Access Road.903 Mr. Fraser says that the police \"made no effort to remove\" that van904 and that the mayor \"and some of the nearby landowners\" complained to the police on 22 December 2015 about the Access Road being blocked, but that \"again the Police did nothing in response\".905\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 20; Fraser WS1, para. 36; Email of 14 December 2015 from [REDACTED] to AOG team with attached Police reports (C-102).\n\nFraser WS1, para. 37; Photograph of White car, 17 December 2015 (C-106).\n\nFraser WS1, para. 37.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 37.\n\n530.\n\nThe police again came on site on 14 January 2016. However, say Messrs. Lewis and Fraser, they once more \"made no effort to remove the van\".906 After AOG \"manually\" lifted the van to move it to the side and Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 replaced it on the track at the end of the day and attached it \"with a chain to a fixing in the ground\",907 the police again \"did nothing\".908 Similarly, the police \"did nothing\" two days later when Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 \"parked her green Renault across the Road\" after AOG had once more moved the white van to the side.909 When AOG moved the van again on 23 January 2016 and surrounded it with \"concrete blocks\",910 Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 called the police but again they failed to intervene.911 By 25 January 2016, various cars were blocking the Access Road but, according to Mr. Fraser, \"[t]he Police patrolled the area and saw all the cars blocking the Road but did nothing whatsoever\".912\n\nMr. Lewis, who was on-site on 14 January 2016, says that a \"lady\", whom he describes as an \"activist\", was \"stubbornly\" standing \"in the middle of the road, blocking us from accessing the drill site\". He adds that the police was called but \"they just stood to the side and did nothing\". He then goes on to say that, after he left, \"the lady, and presumably others, parked a car across the road\".

As regards the events before AOG bought a share in the Access Road, the Claimant did not rebut the Respondent's argument that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 \"was able to prove her ownership of the land\", whereas AOG could not, and the police thus \"could not order her to remove her car from land that she co-owned\".913 After the acquisition, the police appear to have been acting well within their right not to intervene in a private dispute between two co-owners over which it had no jurisdiction absent any indication of criminal conduct. In fact, AOG and Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 both sought the assistance of the police, which refrained from supporting either side. In response to the criminal complaint that AOG filed in January 2016, the police told AOG that \"[o]nly the relevant court is competent to resolve the property relationship and to decide on legitimacy of entitlements of the specific persons to the specific parcels of land\".914\n\nRejoinder, para. 296.\n\nResolution of the District Police Department Bardejov, 15 February 2016, p. 2-4 (R-150). That same resolution also records that the police referred AOG's criminal complaint to the district office \"for further proceedings\", because Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's actions of parking her car across the Access Road was \"a willful act\" that constituted \"a misdemeanor against civil coexistence\" under Article 49(1)(d) of the Act on Misdemeanors. By contrast, it dismissed Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 criminal complaint against AOG's contractors for having severed the metal chain from the white van on 23 January 2016 because there appeared to be no intention to damage her property in the context of a \"civil dispute\".\n\n532.\n\nAs regards the second and third drilling attempts in June and November 2016, the Tribunal reaches the same conclusion, namely that the police rightly refrained from dispersing activists or removing cars. Indeed, absent criminal acts, it appears that they had no competence to do so. Importantly, the police did disperse protestors and activists who were trespassing on the drill site,915 as AOG had a lease for that site and thus a valid title and the trespassing infringed criminal laws.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 56 (\"On 17 June 2016, the access to the Road remained blocked but the contractors were able to continue working on the location. Following a call by one of our lawyers, the Police actually removed protesters from in front of the contractors' vehicles *on the well location*, so it seemed as if they might be becoming more helpful\"; emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n533.\n\nTherefore, even if it were to accept that the Claimant could expect to drill at Smilno, *quod non*, the Tribunal could not conceivably accept the contention that the conduct of the police somehow frustrated such expectation.\n\nThe prosecutor (Measures ## 4-5)\n--------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that one of the prosecutors of the Bardejov district, Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, improperly intervened in AOG's \"civil dispute\" with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 in connection with the Interim Injunction (Measure # 4).916 It also contends that Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 improperly instructed the police to cancel its policing operations at the Smilno site on 18 June 2016 (Measure # 5).917 For the Claimant, Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 \"abused her authority\" on that day by appearing at the Smilno site, since her \"[i]ntervening in this situation was not within her responsibilities or authority\".918 It seeks support from Mr. Baran, who stated that \"it is unheard of for a public prosecutor to attend the scene of a protest such as what happened here\".919 Mr. Fraser testified that Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 referred AOG's lawyer, Dr. Vargae\u0161tok, to the Interim Injunction and allegedly told him \"to advise AOG not to break the law by accessing the Road\".920 She allegedly \"completely rejected\" AOG's arguments, conferred with the police, and then left the site.921 According to Mr. Fraser, the \"direct result\" of her intervention was that the police stopped \"the little they had been doing to assist us\".922 For the Claimant, it cannot be disputed that \"before\" she \"turned up, the Police were dispersing activists\" and stopped thereafter.923\n\nReply, paras. 87-95; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 78-79.\n\nReply, para. 96; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 80.\n\nMemorial, para. 106.\n\nBaran WS, para. 26.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 57.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 57.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 57.\n\nReply, para. 96.\n\n535.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 called Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 to the Smilno site on 18 June 2016. Yet both deny this allegation.924 In fact, the record shows that AOG called the local police, which the Claimant acknowledges,925 and the police called the prosecutor's office.926 Being on \"active emergency service duty\" that day,927 Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 went to Smilno,928 because the police on site believed that the \"atmosphere was tense\" and \"were concerned that [a] crime could occur, and that the situation could escalate\".929 The Tribunal sees nothing untoward in this conduct, noting that the Claimant itself considered the situation to have been tense.930\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 36; Varjanov\u00e1 WS2, para. 26; Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS2, para. 7; Tr.

Assuming it were established, *quod non*, such conduct would in any event hardly be objectionable.\n\n538.\n\nThe Claimant relies on a report from its lawyer generated six months later on 14 December 2016, in which he recounts that Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 invited him for a \"discussion of situation\" while they were on site and \"showed [him] a printed copy of the Preliminary Decision\", highlighting AOG's obligations under the Interim Injunction and recommending him to \"instruct and prevent client from breaking the law\".935 Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 denies this account936 and states that she \"first learned about the Interim Injunction\" when Dr. Vargae\u0161tok showed her \"copies of certain legal documents, such as the title deed, maps, the Interim Injunction itself, and commercial register excerpts\".937 She says that Dr. Vargae\u0161tok mentioned that the injunction did not apply to Cesty Smilno and asked her to \"allow them to pass\",938 which she refused to do for lack of authority.939\n\nSlamka Partners \u2013 Smilno report by JUDr. Pavol Vargaestok of the events on 16-18 June 2016, 14 December 2016, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-161).\n\nSlosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS1, paras. 15-16; Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS2, para. 8.\n\nSlosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS1, para. 16; Tr.

It appears inherently improbable to the Tribunal that she would have appeared at the Smilno site with a copy of the Interim Injunction. She testified that she had never heard of AOG and of AOG's dispute with Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 before.940 It is more likely that AOG's lawyer would have a copy of the injunction and showed it to Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1.\n\nShe did say that she was given a file relating to a criminal complaint on a motor vehicle involving Ms. Varjanov\u00e1, but concluded that there was no criminal offense involved, only a \"civil dispute for payment of damages\". She said she otherwise was not involved in or aware about protests or other activities in Smilno. Tr.

She denies it categorically and was not cross-examined about this point.941 Dr. Vargae\u0161tok's report of 14 December 2016 does not mention any instruction, only that she \"spoke to the police a number of times while she was there and then left at about 3.30 p.m.\".942 Accordingly, even if the Claimant could expect to drill at Smilno, *quod non*, the Tribunal rejects the argument that Dr. Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1's conduct somehow prevented AOG from doing so. It also denies the related request for adverse inferences due to the non-production of documents related to the 18 June 2016 events. Indeed, it has no reason to doubt the representation of the Respondent's counsel that no responsive documents exist.\n\nSlosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS1, paras. 14 and 16; Slosar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 WS2, para. 8.\n\nSlamka Partners \u2013 Smilno report by JUDr. Pavol Vargaestok of the events on 16-18 June 2016, 14 December 2016, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-161).\n\nThe road signage scheme (Measure # 6)\n-------------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the police's refusal to erect road signs at the entrance of the Access Road, which it had promised to do in \"numerous documents\",943 frustrated its expectation to drill at the Smilno site.944 It contends that the police proposed to erect road signs during a meeting with AOG's attorney on 15 July 2016,945 to \"calm the nervous situation down\".946 In reliance on these \"assurances\", AOG allegedly \"engaged extensively with the Bardejov Police Force and the Mayor\" and, while the mayor supported the road signage, the police refused to approve it in October 2016.947 In the Claimant's submission, the police reneged on their promise on the basis of a \"pretextual\" justification and \"inconsistent positions\" on the status of the Access Road.948 In its view, the police also failed to adopt a transparent and fair decision-making process.949 For the Claimant, the refusal was due to a \"personal\" decision of Dr. [REDACTED], the director of the District Traffic Inspectorate, and/or his subordinate, Mr. [REDACTED].950\n\nReply, paras. 99(1) and 101; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 81-84.\n\nReply, para. 296\n\nReply, para. 101; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 81, referring to Email of 15 July 2016 from AOG's Attorney to Mr. Fraser (C-331).

The Police agreed that the law states that the Road was public even without such a procedure but they said something needed to be done to calm the nervous situation\").\n\nReply, para. 102; Fraser WS1, para. 66.\n\nReply, paras. 98 and 102-104.\n\nReply, para. 99(1) and (3).\n\nReply, para. 99(2).\n\nReply, paras. 99(3) and 106.\n\n542.\n\nSince any alleged assurance or promise given by the police in July 2016 post-dates Discovery's decision to drill at the Smilno site,951 the Claimant could in any event not rely on those alleged statements even if the Tribunal were to accept that the Claimant could expect to drill at Smilno.\n\nEmail of 16 July 2016 from Matej S\u0177kora (C-331).\n\n543.\n\nMoreover, the police officer alleged to have made the contentious promise, the Director of the Bardejov Police Force, Mr. [REDACTED] had no competence to this effect, as such competence is vested in the head of the District Traffic Inspectorate of the Bardejov police, Dr. [REDACTED].952\n\nMr. Fraser accepts that \"only\" the \"Bardejov Police traffic department\" \"could grant formal approval of the design\". Fraser WS2, para. 20.\n\n544.\n\nIn any event, the email recounting Dr. S\u0177kora's \"informal meeting\" with Mr. [REDACTED] does not mention any promise or assurance guaranteeing a particular outcome. It speaks of a \"plan\" to \"open the procedure\" to place a traffic sign, which \"should\" serve to clarify that the \"track\" was \"public\", and asks for Mr. Fraser's agreement to \"start the process\".953 In fact, Mr. Fraser himself speaks of a \"suggestion\", not a promise.954\n\nEmail of 16 July 2016 from Matej S\u0177kora (C-331).\n\nFraser WS2, para. 18. The only mention he makes of a promise is that the police had \"promised complete support\" to enter the Access Road \"once the road signs were in place\" (Fraser WS1, para. 67). The same defects taint the Claimant's contention that AOG's well engineer, Mr. [REDACTED], received various \"assurances\" early October 2016 during \"various meetings\" with the mayor and members of the traffic department that the signage scheme would succeed. The Claimant provided no detail about the type of assurances or any corroborating evidence of Mr.[REDACTED]' accounts (Fraser WS2, para. 20). Similarly, the Claimant's contention that Dr. [REDACTED] and/or Mr. [REDACTED] reached a \"personal decision\" or that the decision was \"pretextual\" is unsupported by any corroborating evidence, other than internal emails and hearsay evidence. Mr. Fraser's email to the JV Partners of 14 October 2016 saying that Mr. [REDACTED] had told Mr. [REDACTED] that \"he would approve the signage scheme\" is irreconcilable with Mr. Fraser's subsequent account that Mr. [REDACTED] \"*still* considers that the track is an agricultural track and so not suitable for a regular road sign\" (emphasis by the Tribunal). Email of 14 October 2016 from Mr. Fraser (C-151); Reply, para. 99(3) and 106.\n\n545.\n\nMore importantly, since the Access Road was not a PSPR, it is unsurprising that the District Traffic Inspectorate rejected the signage scheme on 11 October 2016.955 Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant's argument that Measure # 6 frustrated its expectation to drill at Smilno. In this context, it also rejects the request to draw any adverse inference from the Respondent's alleged failure to produce documents relating to the internal decision-making process of the District Traffic Inspectorate.\n\nLetter of 11 October 2016 from the Police to the Smilno municipality (C-153).\n\nThe Ministry of Interior (Measure # 7)\n--------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nThe Claimant finally contends that the MoI \"instructed\" the police in December 2016 that the Access Road was a private road,956 which was allegedly \"inconsistent\" with that Ministry's 2010 guidance and thus frustrated its expectations.957\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 85-86.\n\nClaimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 85-86.\n\n547.\n\nThe record shows that the MoI did not give an \"instruction\", but merely responded to a request for \"methodological guidance\" from the Regional Traffic Inspectorate in Pre\u0161ov on the \"interpretation and assessment of the terms 'track/rural road' [\u2026] and 'public special purpose road'\" in relation to the Access Road.958\n\nStatement of the Ministry of Interior regarding the classification of the Road, 19 December 2016, p. 1 (C-23).\n\n548.\n\nThat Inspectorate requested guidance on how to classify the Access Road by reference to the position of the MoT on the classification of PSPRs and due to the lack of entry in the official registries about the status of the Access Road. In its response, the MoI stated that, in the absence of records about the Access Road, the latter was not a PSPR, but \"private land\" for which \"public use\" or \"traffic supervision\" would not be justified.959\n\nStatement of the Ministry of Interior regarding the classification of the Road, 19 December 2016, pp. 1-2 (C-23) (\"The Ministry of Interior agrees with your legal opinion based on the fact that if the Smilno Municipality does not have available any documentation evidencing the existence of a road on land plot with Parcel No. 2721/780 in the Smilno Real Estate Registration Area, and no other documentation evidencing the existence of such road exists, then the road in question is not a special purpose road and must be seen as private land the public use of which is not justified by any tangible evidence, and therefore it is not possible to carry out traffic supervision on such land\").\n\n549.\n\nConsidering that as a matter of law the Access Road was not a PSPR, there is nothing wrong about this answer, which in any event post-dated AOG's last attempt to access the drill site.\n\n550.\n\nFor these reasons, even if it were to accept that the Claimant could have had any expectation as to its right to drill at Smilno, *quod non*, the Tribunal would still reject the Claimant's contention that Measure # 7 frustrated its expectation to engage in any such drilling.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n551.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing discussion, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that even if Discovery had legitimate expectations in respect of the Smilno site, which it did not, for the reasons set out above, Slovakia did in any event not fail to honor or frustrate any such expectations.\n\n**(b) Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka**\n------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent breached its legitimate expectation to drill an exploration well at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka when the MoA refused to approve the Lease Amendment and the MoE denied a compulsory access order and then suspended the proceedings under Article 29 of the Geology Act.960\n\nMemorial, paras. 130-157 and 232-234; Reply, paras. 116-141 and 299-304; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 50, 52, 87-120 and 158.\n\n553.\n\nAfter determining whether the Claimant had any legitimate expectations in relation to Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka (section (i)), the Tribunal will assess whether the Slovak Republic breached those expectations (section (ii)). As the analysis will show, the Slovak Republic did not generate any legitimate expectation to drill at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and, even if one were to assume such expectation existed, the Slovak Republic did not frustrate it. As with Smilno, the latter analysis is conducted merely for the sake of completeness.\n\n**(i) The Slovak Republic did not generate any legitimate expectations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nDiscovery asserts that the Medzilaborce Exploration License and its renewals, read in conjunction with the Geology Act, contained the implicit representation or assurance that AOG would be able to drill a well at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka.961 Therefore, so it says, it legitimately expected that no State organ would prevent AOG conducting its exploration program.962\n\nMemorial, para. 224; Reply, para. 288.\n\nMemorial, para. 226; Reply, para. 22.\n\n555.\n\nThe Respondent answers that the Medzilaborce Exploration License did not contain any \"specific assurances\" giving AOG a \"blank check\" to carry out exploration activities.963 AOG was to comply with \"numerous specific conditions\" spelled out in the Medzilaborce Exploration License, including \"the obligation to secure all rights required to access and use third-party land\".964\n\nRejoinder, paras. 259-260.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 310-311; Reply, paras. 117-141 and 299-304.\n\n556.\n\nFor substantially the same reasons already set out in relation to Smilno, the Tribunal finds that neither the Medzilaborce Exploration License, nor its renewals contain any specific representation that AOG would be able to drill at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka. Accordingly, the Slovak Republic did not generate the expectation now invoked by the Claimant. Even if the Tribunal were to consider that such an expectation existed and that Discovery relied on it when deciding to invest in Slovakia in March 2014, the Claimant could only expect to conduct its activities at the Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka site provided it complied with applicable statutory, regulatory and contractual regimes. For completeness, the Tribunal nonetheless addresses below the measures about which Discovery complains on the assumption that it could expect to drill at Kriv\u00e1 Olka if it complied with its various obligations.\n\n**(ii) Even if the Slovak Republic had created any legitimate expectations, it did not frustrate them**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nThe Claimant complains that the following measures prevented AOG from drilling at Kriv\u00e1 Olka:965\n\n\u2022 the MoA's refusal to approve the Lease Amendment pursuant to Article 50(7) of the Forests Act in June 2016 (Measure # 8);966\n\n\u2022 the MoE's denial of a compulsory access order under Article 29 of the Geology Act in March 2017 (Measure # 9);967 and\n\n\u2022 the MoE's suspension of the Article 29 proceedings in June 2017 (Measure # 10)968\n\nMemorial, paras. 72 and 232-234; Reply, paras. 299-304; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 50, 52 and 87-120.\n\nMemorial, paras. 232-233; Reply, paras. 300-303; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 88 and 105-115.\n\nMemorial, para. 234; Reply, para. 304; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 88 and 116-119.\n\nReply, para. 304; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 88 and 120.\n\n558.\n\nThe Respondent denies having frustrated any expectations the Claimant may have had.969 It argues that AOG's own legal mistakes were the reason for its failure to drill a well at Kriv\u00e1 Olka.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 323-329; Rejoinder, paras. 328-365; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 176-179.\n\nThe MoA's refusal to approve the Lease Amendment (Measure # 8)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, and supposing that the Claimant had legitimate expectations, *quod non,* the MoA's conduct does not rise to a breach of legitimate expectations because AOG acted late in requesting the extension of the Lease and the Lease Amendment did not comply with Article III(2) of the Lease. Even if the Tribunal were to find that the MoA's decision refusing the Lease Amendment was too formalistic, it is clear that the extension was subject to other conditions and that AOG did not fulfil these conditions. Put differently, AOG cannot legitimately expect not to be held to binding contractual conditions.\n\n560.\n\nThe Medzilaborce Exploration License was issued on 17 July 2006 and renewed in 2010, 2014 and 2016.970 Aurelian had already identified the \"Stromy Lead\" in 2010.971 Subsequently, AOG identified a well location, calling the prospect \"Stromy-1\" or \"O\u013eka Stromy\" until 2015 and thereafter \"Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka\".972 On 11 September 2014, the JV Partners agreed to drill an exploration well there, planning to drill by the end of that year.973\n\nStatement about determination of exploration area (Medzilaborce), NR.: 7673/2006-6.2, 17 July 2006 (C-3 and R-30); Decision about extension of the geological survey permit (Medzilaborce), Ref.

It obtained a temporary exemption in January of that year from the Land and Forest Department of the Humenn\u00e9 District Office to use forest land for exploration purposes until the end of the year, which was extended in December 2015 until 31 January 2017 (Humenn\u00e9 District Office Decision exempting forest plots exempted from their function, 16 December 2015 (C-104); Act No. 326/2005 Coll. on Forests, as amended, Article 5(1) (R-70)); secured logging rights in April 2015 valid until 31 December 2015 (State Forestry consent for logging, 10 April 2015 (C-70)); submitted a drilling program to the mining authority by August 2015 (see Partner Progress Report, 25 August 2015 (C-79)); and prepared a \"project of geological works\" in November 2015 to drill a 1,200 meter deep exploration well at that site (Project of Geological Works Kriva Olka, 2 November 2015 (C-82)). On 3 December 2015, the JV Partners approved drilling at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka \"by the beginning of March\" 2016 for an estimated cost of EUR 1,046,000 (Opcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, items 4 and 15(5), pp. 2 and 4 (C-100); Operations Update for Opcom, 3 December 2015, pp. 2 and 5 of the pdf document (C-101); AOG 2016 approved budget, 3 December 2015, pp. 1 and 3 (C-97).

It obtained a forest exemption in January 2015, valid until 31 December 2015,975 and the Lease Agreement on 4 May 2015, valid until 15 January 2016.

The Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka is located within the area of the Medzilaborce Exploration License and therefore falls within the jurisdiction of the Medzilaborce District Office. It is thus unclear why the Humenn\u00e9 District Office was involved.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 138; Lease Agreement between AOG and State Forestry, 4 May 2015, Article III(1) (C-73) (\"The Contract is concluded for a definite period of time, starting from the date of its entry into force until 15 January 2016\").\n\n562.\n\nUnder Article VIII(5) of the Lease Agreement, that agreement was to be approved by the MoA in accordance with Article 50(7) of the Forests Act,977 commonly referred to as the \"prior consent\" procedure applicable to areas exceeding 5,000 m2.978 The MoA granted that consent on 19 October 2015 and the Lease was valid from that moment onwards.979\n\nLease Agreement between AOG and State Forestry, 4 May 2015, Article VIII(5) (C-73) (\"The Contract becomes valid on the day of the granting of consent to rent according to Article 50 par. 7.

The Tribunal notes in this context that AOG failed to drill the Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka well in the time window that was at its disposal, namely between 19 October 2015 and 15 January 2016. Although AOG stated in an internal email of 6 July 2015 that, once the MoA approved the Lease, \"we can start building location\", nothing indicates that AOG did so (Email of 6 July 2015 from Ron Crow (C-278)). On Mr. Lewis' own account, \"[d]rilling and completion of the works in Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka would have taken about a month\" (Lewis WS2, para. 23). One would have expected AOG to prepare itself while waiting for the MoA's approval of the Lease in order to be in a position to drill promptly after receiving that approval. Paradoxically, notwithstanding AOG's main focus on oil discoveries (Lewis WS1, para. 31) and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka being one of the two the priority wells (Opcom minutes, 11 September 2014, p. 3 (C-61)), and although it was in possession of the main permits for Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and faced little to no local opposition there, AOG shifted its attention to Smilno, a gas well for which no gas transportation infrastructure existed and for which it had not secured access rights.\n\n563.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Article III(2) of the Lease Agreement, AOG could obtain an extension of the Lease Agreement if it \"deliver[ed] a request to the Lessor [i.e. LSR] for the extension of the lease *no later than one month before the termination of the Contract*\".980 Accordingly, as the Claimant accepts981 and contemporaneously understood,982 AOG was to submit an extension request by 15 December 2015 at the latest.983 It is common ground that the MoA had to give its \"prior consent\" for an extension.\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.

On 23 June 2016, the new Minister of Agriculture, Ms. Mate\u010dn\u00e1, informed AOG that she could not approve the Lease Amendment, because the Lease had expired (Article III(1) of the Lease Agreement); AOG had failed to comply with the one-month time limit to seek an extension (Article III(2) of the Lease Agreement); and the proposed duration of the Lease Amendment did not comply with the contractual provisions of the Lease (Article III(2) of the Lease Agreement).989 Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1 concluded her letter by recommending that AOG apply to the MoE to obtain a compulsory access order under the Geology Act.990\n\nMinister Mate\u010dn\u00e1 wrote as follows: \"It follows from documentation pertaining to these proceedings that the validity of the above lease agreement (approved prior to its conclusion by this Ministry pursuant to Section 50(7) of Act No. 326/2005 Coll. on forests, as amended) has terminated as a result of the fulfilment and/or non-fulfilment of conditions set out in its Article III dealing with the lease term. Validity of the said lease agreement has terminated as a result of the expiry of the lease term pursuant to its Article III (1), as well as non-fulfilment of the conditions of its extension pursuant to Article III (2) of the lease agreement; namely, the time limit for applying for a renewal was not complied with, and the length of time for which a renewal was requested was not in conformance with the above contractual provision. Having regard to the above facts, I would like to inform you that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic will not grant its prior consent to the lease of a State-owned forest land in the form of Amendment 1 to the above lease agreement, as the negotiated contractual terms and conditions required for this have not been fulfilled. Also, I would like to submit that it is irrelevant that the said Amendment 1 has already been signed both by you and the State-owned enterprise LESY Slovenskej republiky, as CEOs of a State-owned enterprises may sign similar documents only after having obtained the prior consent to such lease from the Ministry; otherwise such an act is invalid and the document is not legally binding\" (Response from the Ministry of Agriculture regarding the Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka well and the lease approval, 23 June 2016 (C-19)).\n\nResponse from the Ministry of Agriculture regarding the Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka well and the lease approval, 23 June 2016, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-19).\n\n567.\n\nOut of the three reasons underlying Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1's decision, the debate between the Parties focused on the first two, in particular on whether the MoA was bound to ratify the Lease Amendment because LSR had already approved it, as the Claimant contends, or whether the MoA could no longer give its prior consent because the lease had expired and could not be resurrected, as Slovakia submits.\n\n568.\n\nWhatever the merits of the Parties' positions in this debate, the fact is that the Claimant missed the 15 December 2015 time limit to apply for the lease extension. AOG knew that the lease extension was subject to two levels of approval within one month, of which two weeks were effectively neutralized due to the holiday season. It should therefore have anticipated this situation.991 Contrary to the Claimant's assertion, the delay was not a mere \"technicality\". AOG was well aware that the Lease Amendment would only be valid once it had been approved by the MoA.992\n\nThe explanation which AOG gave to Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1 that its intention had been to obtain a lease extending \"for the term of AOG's use of the site\", but that it had been \"instructed\" \"at the end of 2015\" \"to obtain a new agreement instead\" (Letter of 27 May 2016 to Ministry of Agriculture (C-132)), is perplexing and belied by contemporaneous evidence (Email of 28 April 2015 from Ron Crow, p. 1 (C-272)).\n\nLetter of 27 May 2016 to Ministry of Agriculture (C-132) (\"AOG's new lease agreement with the State Forestry for this site is not valid until approved by the Ministry of Agriculture\"); Email of 6 July 2015 from Ron Crow, p. 2 (C-278) (\"Once this is signed we can start building location\").\n\n569.\n\nIn addition, the Lease Amendment provided for a duration \"until 01 August 2016\",993 when Article III(2) of the Lease required an extension for \"at least [\u2026] one year\".994 The Claimant did not explain this discrepancy.995 It may be due to the fact that the Medzilaborce Exploration License was due to expire in August 2016996 and that the JV Partners had not yet decided on AOG's suggestion to relinquish part of the license areas \"in order to reduce the 2016 licence fee\".997 Be this as it may, the fact remains that, here again, AOG did not fulfil the conditions for the Lease extension, and Discovery cannot reasonably argue that AOG should not be held to its binding contractual conditions.\n\nAddendum No. 1 extending the Lease Agreement, 14 January 2016, Article I.A (C-116).\n\nLease Agreement between AOG and State Forestry, 4 May 2015, Article III(2) (C-73).\n\nReply, paras. 126-129.\n\nLetter of 14 January 2016 from State Forestry (C-296).\n\nOpcom Minutes, 3 December 2015, item 14 (C-100).\n\n570.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to consider that the MoA's decision was excessively formalistic or flawed as a matter of Slovak law, that would not in and of itself rise to the level of a breach of an international obligation. It is common place that, without more, a breach of domestic law does not as such amount to a breach of international law.998 At most, this was a temporary setback that did not doom AOG's exploration plans altogether, especially since AOG had received a five-year extension of the Medzilaborce Exploration License two weeks before Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1's decision999 and Mr. Lewis was \"excited\" about the \"many legitimate prospects\" he had identified.1000 Moreover, Mr. Fraser testified that LSR had been collaborative and willing to share information about \"all of its land\" to enable AOG to identify other possible wells, giving AOG \"excellent access to a large number of future well locations\".1001\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.

First, the Claimant argues that the MoA refused to approve the lease extension because of Mr. [REDACTED]'s personal prejudice or bias against AOG. Second, the Claimant complains that the MoA took six months to notify its refusal and that AOG could have used that time to initiate Article 29 proceedings.\n\n572.\n\nAs to the first point, the claim is unsubstantiated. Nothing in the record evidences with sufficient certainty that Mr. [REDACTED], the newly appointed Head of the Service Office of the MoA, was biased against AOG. As proof, the Claimant relies exclusively on its internal communications or hearsay information from AOG's PR advisers and a lobbying firm called Dynamic Relations 2000 without any corroborating evidence to support its assertions.1002 For instance, there is no contemporaneous evidence showing that Mr. [REDACTED] based his \"pre-election campaign on opposing AOG's project\".1003 The conversations of AOG's PR adviser, Mr. [REDACTED], were with two people at the MoA who did not know Mr. [REDACTED] personally.1004 As for the alleged conversation on 15 June 2016 between a member of parliament, Mr. [REDACTED], and Mr. [REDACTED] , during which the latter is said to have asserted that he would \"definitely\" not sign the lease extension because of \"his political career\",1005 nothing in the record shows that Mr. [REDACTED] influenced Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1's decision or that Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1 herself was biased against AOG.\n\nEmail of 9 May 2016 from Mr. [REDACTED] (C-109); Email of 9 May 2016 from Alexander Fraser (C-307); Email of 13 May 2016 from[REDACTED] to AOG (C-130); Email of 13 May 2016 from [REDACTED] to AOG Team (C-131); Email of 26 May 2016 from Alexander Fraser (C-310); Report from Mr. [REDACTED], 14 June 2016, p. 3 of the pdf document (R-122); Email of 15 June 2016 from Snowball (C-314).

This is also the place to deny the request for adverse inferences in connection with the non-production of communications between LSR and the MoA in relation to AOG's request for a new lease on 18 July 2016, since LSR never submitted that lease proposal to the MoA,1007 such that responsive documents are unlikely to exist. Even if documents existed, one does not see how they would show that the MoA's refusal of the license extension was arbitrary or discriminatory.\n\nIn an email to AOG's lobbying firm, Mr. Fraser suggested that the Minister approve the extension instead of Mr. [REDACTED]: \"Alternatively, can the Minister sign instead of Mr. [REDACTED] ?\". See Email of 13 May 2016 from Mr. Fraser to [REDACTED], p. 1 of the pdf document (C-130).\n\nLetter of 29 December 2016 from State Forestry to MoE, pp. 11-12 (C-156); Minutes of Oral Hearing, 7 February 2017, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-365).\n\n574.\n\nTurning to the second additional point, it is true that the act of refusal took over five months to be taken. However, the Claimant was aware that the MoA's decision could take between several days and six months, which was the time taken for the original Lease.1008 Moreover, the Claimant itself mentions that the elections in the spring of 2016 resulted in the decision-making processes in Slovakia being \"bogged down\" pending the nomination of new officials.1009 While regrettable, the time taken for the extension was in no way unreasonable.\n\nEmail from Ron Crow, 28 April 2015, pp. 1-2 (C-72 and C-272); Fraser WS1, para. 30.\n\nFor instance, in an internal email dated 9 February 2016, Mr. [REDACTED] told Messrs. Lewis and Fraser that the MoE had asked \"for patience\" considering the election season and that the situation would likely \"be more normalised\" after the election.

See Fraser WS1, para. 20, 42-43 and 79; Reply, para. 125.\n\n575.\n\nFor these reasons, even if it were to accept that the Claimant could expect to drill at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, *quod non*, the Tribunal would dismiss the claim in relation to Measure # 8.\n\nThe MoE's refusal to grant a compulsory access order (Measure # 9)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the MoE frustrated its expectation to drill at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, because it denied a compulsory access order under Article 29 of the Geology Act on \"pretextual\" grounds.1010 It contends that, although MoE officials, including from Mr. [REDACTED] , initially stated that the MoE would grant the request, the latter actually denied the application due to instructions from the \"higher levels\" of the Ministry.1011 The Claimant adds that, even though Minister S\u00f3lymos quashed that denial decision, it \"was then back to square one\".1012 During the Hearing, it put to Minister S\u00f3lymos that he should have granted the access order, rather than remanding the case to the lower level in the Ministry.1013\n\nMemorial, paras. 143-154, 232 and 234; Reply, paras. 133-140 and 304; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 52, 88, 109-115.\n\nMemorial, para. 152; Reply, para. 138 referring to Email of 9 March 2017 from Viktor Beran (C-370); AOG's report to Partners, 10 March 2017, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-169) (\"On 9 March we were advised by the Ministry of Environment that our application for a compulsory access order under s. 29 of the Geology Act would be rejected.

Article 29(9) of the Geology Act specifies that the MoE must reach a decision within six months, subject to a six-month extension if the initial period is \"insufficient for objective reasons\".\n\n579.\n\nThe main facts are undisputed. On 30 August 2016, AOG requested an order under to Article 29 of the Geology Act to access an area of 8,076 m\u00b2 at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka (the \"Article 29 Application\").1015 Prior to that, on 18 July 2016, AOG had proposed to LSR to conclude a new lease for the Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka site,1016 but had received no response.1017\n\nAOG's Article 29 Application, 30 August 2016 (C-143). AOG's lawyer, Mr. Viktor Beran, informed AOG on 12 July 2016 about a recommendation issued by the MoE on the information an Article 29 application would have to contain and advised that \"there is no entitlement to a positive decision of the Ministry, so a decision in Alpines' favour is by no means assured\".

AOG's lawyer who attended the hearing, Mr. Viktor Beran, informed his client that \"[m]ost of the time\" was spent on the question whether the MoA was a participant in the proceedings. He added that the MoE sought \"to persuade\" AOG to submit a request for a new lease to LSR, but that this was \"denied resolutely\" because AOG no longer trusted LSR or the MoA to process such a request \"in due course\" (Email of 8 February 2017 from Viktor Beran, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-366).\n\nMinutes of Oral Hearing, 7 February 2017, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-365).\n\n583.\n\nThe following day, the MoE concluded that the MoA lacked standing and excluded it from the proceedings.1026 On 6 March 2017, the MoE's Department of State Geological Administration rejected the Article 29 Application on the ground that the MoE could not infringe upon the MoA's competence in matters of State-owned forest land. Specifically, it held that the MoA did not consent to the Lease Amendment and that itself it could not \"replace\" such consent.1027\n\nSee Decision by the Ministry of Environment regarding the compulsory access order, 6 March 2017, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-25).\n\nThe MoE provided the following reasoning: \"If the validity of the lease agreement pursuant to the Section 50 subsect. 7 of the Forest Act requires the consent of the Ministry of Agriculture, as a competence defined by a rule of public law, the Ministry is of the opinion that such consent cannot be replaced by the procedure pursuant to the Section 29 of the Geological Act, as the aim of the legislation while applying the statutory rule through of [sic] an issue act of application of law, is to get into ownership and usage relationships, such as exclusively private law relationships. The Ministry therefore concluded that the mentioned legal competence of the Ministry of Agriculture could not be considered a private law institute, but a public competence which the Ministry could not transfer to itself through a decision issued in the given matter. In the given matter, it is possible to substitute the manifestation of will of the party to the proceedings \u2013 LESY Slovenskej republiky, \u0161.p., as an administrator of the state-owned real estate concerned, but not the consent of the Ministry of Agriculture, as a governmental agency whose public position in the given matter is constituted by a rule of public law. The consent of the Ministry of Agriculture has, by its nature, the character of a precedent condition connected by a rule of public law with the validity or even perfection of a legal act by which forest property owned by the state is left temporarily, by lease or by other contract, to a certain subject of legal relations. Due to the fact that by decision in the given matter the Ministry would accede to the competences of another governmental agency whose competence is regulated by a special legal regulation, the Ministry had to decide to reject the submitted petition\". Decision by the Ministry of Environment regarding the compulsory access order, 6 March 2017, p. 5 of the pdf document (C-25).\n\n584.\n\nAOG appealed that decision on 24 March 2017,1028 and, on 13 June 2017, Minister S\u00f3lymos annulled it, based on a proposal made by a special commission of the MoE. He remanded the matter to the Department of State Geological Administration \"for a new discussion and decision\".1029 In essence, Minister S\u00f3lymos held that the MoE had insufficiently ascertained whether AOG and LSR could conclude a new lease.1030 Moreover, he disagreed that the MoE would \"intervene in the exercise of public competence\" of the MoA if a compulsory access order were granted, since the case at hand concerned a \"private law relationship\" between LSR and AOG.1031 In other words, the first instance decision was annulled because, contrary to the Department of State Geological Administration's misguided understanding, the MoE would not arrogate to itself the MoA's public competence to approve a lease on State-owned forest land. In reality, granting AOG's request would not have resulted in a lease approved by the MoE instead of the MoA, but in an access order for which no approval from the MoA was necessary.\n\nSee Decision of the MoE, 13 June 2017, p. 5 (C-174).\n\nDecision of the MoE, 13 June 2017, p. 1 (C-174).\n\nDecision of the MoE, 13 June 2017, p. 8 (C-174).\n\nDecision of the MoE, 13 June 2017, p. 9 (C-174).\n\n585.\n\nBased on these facts, the Claimant's arguments that the first instance decision was caused by a higher level instruction and that Minister S\u00f3lymos should not have remanded the case do not withstand scrutiny. The first argument is rebutted by the fact that Minister S\u00f3lymos annulled the first instance decision. It is thus no surprise that the Claimant does not come close to substantiating its assertion of instruction. It relies on internal communications and hearsay about conversations between AOG's lawyer, Mr. Viktor Beran and Mr. [REDACTED], a junior official in the Department.1032 This being so, it did not present Mr. Beran to testify about his conversations with Mr. [REDACTED], while the Respondent offered the testimony of Minister S\u00f3lymos. The latter was adamant that he gave no instruction to reject the Article 29 Application1033 and was not aware of anyone else having done so.1034 On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Minister S\u00f3lymos' testimony, which is reinforced by his annulment of the first instance decision.1035\n\nAOG in particular relies on an email sent by Mr. Beran on 9 March 2017 in which he says that Mr. [REDACTED] told him that \"they were finalizing the wording in favour of AOG, when they received instruction from the high levels of the Ministry, to decide negatively\". Mr. Beran further stated that his view was that \"they are just scared to pass any decision that might rise negative public reaction\". Email of 9 March 2017 from Viktor Beran (C-370). See also AOG Report, 10 March 2017, p. 2 (C-169).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 149:13-18, 150:16-18 and 151:12-152:1 (S\u00f3lymos).\n\nS\u00f3lymos WS2, paras. 12-13; Tr. (Day 3), 160:13-18 and 162:16-21 (S\u00f3lymos).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. S\u00f3lymos did not remember receiving two withheld documents entitled \"Draft of the information for the Minister\" prepared by Mr. [REDACTED] on 17 October 2016 and 13 February 2017s, identified as document nos. 7\\_0079 and 7\\_0081 in the Respondent's privilege log, and which contain \"an assessment of potential implications\", respectively of \"denying\" or \"positive and negative decisions\" in relation to the Article 29 Application. The Respondent stated at the Hearing that a \"draft was prepared, but [that] it was not delivered to the Minister\", following which Minister S\u00f3lymos stated with respect to the first document: \"I do not remember at all ever receiving such a document. I don't remember. So I likely have not received it\"; and with respect to the second document: \"But I don't remember that information at all. I don't even remember ever receiving it. [\u2026] I've never seen anything like that\". Tr. (Day 3), 125:8-127:23 and 147:7-149:4 (S\u00f3lymos); Tr. (Day 6), 91:14-17 (Anway); Respondent's Privilege Log, 14 July 2023, p. 4.\n\n586.\n\nBut even if another official in the MoE had given an instruction, the Claimant has not identified who that official may be. Other than Minister S\u00f3lymos, the Claimant mentions two other officials as possibilities: Ms. [REDACTED], the director general of the Geology Directorate, and Ms. [REDACTED], the director of the Department of State Geological Administration. The first had no involvement with AOG, but for attending the 15 December 2016 meeting together with Minister S\u00f3lymos,1036 where AOG's internal exchanges show that AOG felt that the officials in attendance \"were very aware of and sympathetic about our challenges\".1037\n\nEmail of 9 December 2016 from Ms.[REDACTED] to the AOG attendees ahead of the meeting at the Ministry of Environment (C-158).\n\nEmail of 15 December 2016 from Alexander Fraser (C-350); Email of 15 December 2015 from A.

Rather, the opposite seems true. Internal AOG emails depict Ms. [REDACTED] as supportive and understanding of AOG's \"troubles\".1040 Actually, the Claimant confirmed at the Hearing that officials at the MoE and \"specifically Ms. [REDACTED] \" were \"supportive of AOG\".1041\n\nMinutes of Oral Hearing, 7 February 2017, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-365); Decision by the Ministry of Environment regarding the compulsory access order, 6 March 2017, p. 5 of the pdf document (C-25); Tr. (Day 3), 114:7-8 (S\u00f3lymos).\n\nAlthough Mr. [REDACTED] may have \"kept assuring\" Mr. Beran that there was \"no reason\" to reject the Article 29 Application (Email of 17 October 2016 from Viktor Beran (C-337); Email of 9 March 2017 from Viktor Beran (C-370)), it may simply be that Ms.[REDACTED] disagreed with his views and that she had a different legal assessment than the one he might have had.\n\nSee, for instance, Email of 9 February 2016 from [REDACTED] to AOG Team (C-124).\n\nTr. (Day 6), 21:9-13 (Tushingham).\n\n588.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant did not establish that the MoE's decision was caused by an instruction from above. In this context, the Tribunal is disinclined to draw an adverse inference from the Respondent's non-production of documents relating to the first instance decision-making process. The Respondent stated that no responsive documents exist about any instruction from \"above\", which appears plausible considering the facts just reviewed.\n\n589.\n\nIn its second argument, the Claimant complains about Minister S\u00f3lymos remanding the Article 29 Application. It raised this argument for the first time at the Hearing, which limited the Respondent's opportunity to address it.1042 Be this as it may, the argument is in any event ill-founded. Remanding was one of the options open to Minister S\u00f3lymos under Article 59 (2) and (3) of the Administrative Procedure Code:1043\n\n\"(2) If there are grounds for it, the appellate body may alter or quash the decision; otherwise, the appeal shall be dismissed, and the decision shall be upheld.\n\n(3) The appellate body shall quash the decision and return the matter to the administrative authority that issued it for new consideration and a decision, if deemed more appropriate particularly for reasons of expediency or economy; the administrative authority shall be bound by the legal opinion of the appellate body\".1044\n\nTr.

Although the Claimant did not file AOG's appeal brief, the decision refers to the request for relief as follows:\n\n\"[T]o annul the contested decision of the Ministry pursuant to the Section 61 subsect.2 of the Administrative Procedure Code and to return the case for a new hearing and decision, or to amend the contested decision\".1045\n\nDecision of the MoE, 13 June 2017, p. 6 (C-174).\n\n591.\n\nFinally, further fact-finding was necessary \"to establish unequivocally and without any doubt\" that AOG and LSR could not agree on a new lease.1046 Hence, remanding the case to the lower instance made perfect sense.1047\n\nDecision of the MoE, 13 June 2017, pp. 8-9 (C-174).\n\nThe appeal decision having clarified that the relationship between LSR and AOG was a matter of private law, that it was LSR, as administrator, that exercised the owner's rights over State-owned forests, and that only LSR had standing as a party in the Article 29 proceedings, it made sense to re-assess the feasibility of a lease agreement under these specifications.\n\n592.\n\nTo conclude, even assuming the Claimant could expect to drill at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, *quod non*, the Tribunal would dismiss the claim in connection with Measure # 9.\n\nThe MoE's suspension of the Article 29 proceedings (Measure # 10)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nIt is the Claimant's submission that the MoE's decision, made on 27 June 2017 following remand, suspending the Article 29 proceedings pending the resolution of a \"preliminary issue\" breached its expectation to drill at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka.1048 It argues that the MoE's request for documents demonstrating the outcome of negotiations between AOG and LSR was \"inconsistent, arbitrary, inexplicable and pretextual\" because the MoE had already asked for such documents in September 2016 and knew that no agreement could be reached with LSR on a new lease.1049 Moreover, it was \"tolerably clear\" that no lease could be secured, since the MoA had refused to approve the Lease Amendment in June 2016 and LSR had refused to process the new lease proposal in July 2016.1050\n\nReply, paras. 133(3) and 141; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 52, 88, 120 and 158.\n\nReply, para. 141(2)\n\nReply, para. 141(7).\n\n594.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent's contention that AOG ceased participating in the procedure.1051 For the Claimant, AOG \"continued to engage with the MoE in its attempts to obtain a compulsory access order\", but the MoE imposed \"unjustified and arbitrary procedural roadblocks to delay AOG's application\".1052 Therefore, the Claimant concludes that the MoE did not act in good faith nor process AOG's application fairly.1053\n\nReply, para. 141.\n\nReply, para. 141.\n\nReply, para. 141, referring to Fraser WS1, para. 88.\n\n595.\n\nThe Respondent answers that the MoE was justified in suspending the Article 29 proceedings to ascertain that no lease agreement could be concluded and in requesting proof that no lease would be forthcoming.1054 It stresses that, instead of providing the requested information, AOG stopped participating in the process and subsequently abandoned the Medzilaborce Exploration License.1055 Accordingly, it was AOG's own conduct that led to its inability to access Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka.1056\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 164-166; Rejoinder, paras. 142-145 and 361-365; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 125-127 and 178.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 164-165.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 166.\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that under Slovak law a compulsory access order is a measure of last resort, since it imposes restrictions on the use of private property against the will of the owner. Accordingly, before granting such an order, it was legitimate for the MoE to ensure that AOG and LSR could not agree on a lease (or that the MoA would not give its prior consent).1057\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the MoE has the duty under Article 32(1) of the Code of Administrative Procedure to ascertain all relevant facts prior to reaching a decision. The provision reads in relevant part as follows: \"The administrative body is obliged to ascertain exactly and completely the true state of the matter and, for that purpose, obtain the necessary documents for a decision\". Act No. 71/1967 Coll. on Administrative Procedure, as amended, Article 32(1) (R-170).\n\n597.\n\nWhen the MoE suspended the Article 29 proceedings in June 2017,1058 the MoE did not know with sufficient certainty whether AOG and LSR could agree on a new lease or whether the MoA would approve it or not. LSR had not processed AOG's request a year earlier because it was following the MoA's recommendation to resolve the access issue under the Article 29 procedure.1059 During the February 2017 hearing, the MoA only intervened on its standing and expressed no opinion on whether it would approve a new lease if it were to receive a request.1060\n\nDecision of the Ministry of Environment, 27 June 2017 (R-75).\n\nLetter of 29 December 2016 from State Forestry to MoE, pp. 11-12 (C-156); Minutes of Oral Hearing, 7 February 2017, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-365).\n\nMinutes of Oral Hearing, 7 February 2017, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-365); Email of 8 February 2017 from Viktor Beran, p. 1 of the pdf document (C-366) (\"Ministry of Agriculture did not put forward any statement, positive or negative, regarding the matter itself whatsoever\").\n\n598.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the Claimant's allegation that LSR refused to conclude a new lease, the record shows that AOG itself \"resolutely\" opposed the idea of seeking a new lease at the February 2017 hearing.1061 It was therefore reasonable for the MoE to clarify the position.\n\nEmail of 8 February 2017 from Viktor Beran, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-366) (\"Mr [REDACTED] tried to persuade us to submit new request to LESY SR with regard to the lease agreement, which *we denied resolutely* as we do not trust LESY SR or Ministry of Agriculture that they will process our request in due course\"; emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n599.\n\nFurthermore, all AOG had to do to lift the suspension was to submit a new lease proposal to LSR and, if the latter reacted negatively or not at all, it could then ask the MoE to resume the proceedings.1062 Instead, it remained inactive and eventually relinquished the Medzilaborce Exploration License.1063\n\nThe Claimant was contemporaneously aware of the \"MoE's guidance on its website for Article 29 application\" that AOG did not have to chase down LSR \"repeatedly\", and that it was sufficient to send \"a draft proposal to enter into a lease\" to LSR and for \"a period of 15 days\" to lapse \"without any response\".

Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses this limb of the Claimant's FET claim and now addresses the EIA procedures.\n\n**(c) EIA**\n-----------\n\n602.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the stability of the investment framework protected under the BIT was \"destroyed\" when the Slovak Republic required AOG to perform full EIAs for the Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba wells, and to carry out preliminary EIAs for any future exploration well.1064 It asserts that neither the EIA Directive nor the EIA Act applied to AOG's exploration works since the Slovak Republic had already given its \"development consent\" when granting the Exploration Licenses in 20061065 and granted permits to drill at the three sites.1066\n\nMemorial, paras. 158-197 and 235-238; Reply, paras. 149-193 and 305-314; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 52, 121-142 and 158.\n\nReply, para. 150-155.\n\nReply, para. 156-158.\n\n603.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the MoE and Minister S\u00f3lymos made clear representations \"to AOG directly\", on which it relied, to the effect that AOG \"was under no legal obligation to conduct an EIA prior to drilling its exploration wells\" notwithstanding the amendment to the EIA Act.1067 According to the Claimant, those representations \"generated a further legitimate expectation\" that AOG \"would not be required to conduct a preliminary EIA\".1068 Yet, the Slovak Republic frustrated those expectations which was \"the last nail in the coffin\" and \"precipitated the withdrawal of AOG's JV Partners and ultimately destroyed the value of Discovery's investment\".1069\n\nMemorial, para. 236; Reply, para. 158.\n\nMemorial, para. 236.\n\nMemorial, paras. 158 and 238.\n\n604.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Claimant could legitimately expect being exempted from EIA procedures for drills after 1 January 2017 and that, in any event, it did not frustrate any legitimate expectations that the Claimant may have had.1070 It emphasizes that \"Discovery can point to no assurances made to it, at the time it invested, that future environmental assessments would never be required in any circumstance\".1071 Nor can the Claimant rely on supposed later assurances.1072 The Respondent explains that it enacted the EIA Amendment in full accordance with the police powers doctrine, in response to infringement proceedings commenced by the European Commission in 2013 for its failure to properly transpose the EIA Directive.1073\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 180-210 and 330-344; Rejoinder, paras. 155-201 and 367-398; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 135-155 and 180-183.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 330.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 330.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 331-341.\n\n605.\n\nMoreover, says Slovakia, neither the MoE nor Minister S\u00f3lymos \"ever represented to AOG or Discovery that Slovak authorities would not order a full EIA on AOG when AOG agreed to undergo a Preliminary EIA voluntarily\" or that the EIA Amendment would not apply to future drills.1074 The Respondent underlines that AOG voluntarily submitted preliminary EIA applications, but then \"chose to abandon the process\", although it had prevailed in its appeal from the decision of the Humenn\u00e9 District Office ordering a full EIA for Rusk\u00e1 Poruba.1075\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 342-343.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 210.\n\n606.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the inclusion of a reference to the EIA Amendment in the MoE's decision to modify the exploration area of the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License is \"irrelevant\" and in any event \"consistent with its approach\" of restating conditions that \"apply *ex lege*\".1076\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 217 and 344.\n\n**(i) The Slovak Republic did not generate any legitimate expectations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine whether the Slovak Republic generated any legitimate expectation that AOG would not have to undergo EIA procedures for its exploration drills. As discussed above, in order to succeed on its claim the Claimant must demonstrate the existence of clear and specific representations on which it relied when it decided to invest. In addition to its overall expectation that the Slovak Republic would not hinder the Claimant's exploration in areas covered by the Exploration Licenses, the Claimant invokes the BIT's preamble that links FET to a stable regulatory framework and various statements by the MoE and Minister S\u00f3lymos.1077\n\nMemorial, paras. 235-238; Reply, para. 307.\n\n608.\n\nAs regards the licenses and their renewals, they do not contain any specific representations that Discovery or AOG would not have to perform EIAs for exploratory drillings or that the legislative framework would not evolve in that regard. The Claimant identifies neither a stabilization clause nor a specific commitment of regulatory stability, and it rightly does not contend that the Exploration Licenses contained an \"implied stabilization clause\".1078 The same is true of the preamble of the BIT, which cannot be read as containing a stabilization clause or a guarantee of regulatory stability.1079\n\nTr. (Day 6), 12:23-13:1 (Tushingham) (\"Of course we don't go that far, because there was no such implied stabilization clause in the licences that were granted\").\n\nThe preamble reads in relevant part as follows: \"The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the United States of America [\u2026], Agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources\". Slovak-US BIT, preamble (C-1).\n\n609.\n\nThere is a large consensus in investment arbitration that, absent a stabilization clause or a specific commitment of regulatory stability, an investor cannot legitimately expect that the State will not change its legislative and regulatory framework over time, provided the changes are reasonable, proportionate, non-discriminatory and conform with due process.1080 As noted in *LSG v. Romania*, \"[l]egislation and regulation are by nature dynamic and States enjoy a sovereign right to amend their laws and regulations and to adopt new ones in furtherance of the public interest\"1081 or in the words of *Infinito v. Costa Rica*:\n\n\"Unless they expressly undertake not to do so, States are free to modify the legal regime applicable at the time of the investment to the extent they do so within the limits prescribed by FET, *i.e.*, the evolution must not be unreasonable, discriminatory, disproportionate, or adopted contrary to due process\".1082\n\n*Saluka Investments v. Czech Republic*, para. 304 (CL-11); *AES v. Hungary*, para. 9.3.34 (RL-62); *Ioan Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, para. 666 (CL-36); *Electrabel v.

Costa Rica*, para. 519 (CL-15).\n\n610.\n\nIn the present case, Slovakia not only had the power to amend its regulatory framework, it was also under an obligation to transpose the EIA Directive into its municipal legal regime.1083 As the *Electrabel v. Hungary* tribunal held, EU member States cannot in principle be held liable for acting in compliance with a legally binding decision of an EU institution.1084\n\nThis directive and its amendment were published on 28 January 2012 and 25 April 2014, respectively.

Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 6.72 (RL-74).\n\n611.\n\nSignificantly, on 22 March 2013, i.e. before Discovery's investment decision, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against the Slovak Republic because it had incorrectly transposed the EIA Directive into the EIA Act and, in particular because Annex 8 of the EIA Act, referred to \"exploitation drills\" instead of \"deep drills\", meaning \"that 'exploration drills' ha[d] been excluded in the practice\".1085 On 8 July 2016, the Slovak Republic informed the European Commission that it would amend the EIA Act by deleting the word \"exploitation\", such that all deep drills, including exploration drills, would be captured by the relevant provision.1086 Consistent with that representation, the Slovak Parliament amended the EIA Act on 25 November 2016, which amendment entered into force on 1 January 2017. Since then, exploratory drills deeper than 600 meters required a preliminary EIA. The following table depicts the amended portion of Annex 8 of the EIA Act (the right-hand column concerns preliminary EIAs and the one to its left mandatory EIAs):1087\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 16. | Drills (excluding drills for soil stability investigation related to exploitation activities) in particular: |  | from 600 m |\n|  | - drills for utilizing geothermal energy and geothermal waters | from 500 m | up to 500 m |\n|  | - drills for storing radioactive waste | no limit |  |\n|  | - drills for water sources |  | from 300 m |\n\nSee [REDACTED]. In February 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union confirmed that \"exploratory drillings are a form of deep drilling\" falling within the scope of Annex II, item 2(d) of the EIA Directive (Judgment of 11 February 2015, *Marktgemeinde Stra\u00dfwalchen and Others v. Bundesminister f\u00fcr Wirtschaft, Familie und Jugend*, Case C-531/13, paras. 30-31 (RL-139)).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nNeither version filed in the record by the Parties, whether in Slovak or in English, correctly aligns the elements contained in the two columns on the right, and counsel on both sides agreed that the table should read as depicted above. EIA Act (2017), Annex 8(1)(16), p. 13 of the pdf document (C-225); Act No. 24/2006 Coll. on Environment Impact Assessment, as amended (applicable as of 1 January 2017), Annex 8(1)(16), p. 13 of the pdf document (R-200); Tr. (Day 6), 137:19-139:13 (Pekar and Tushingham).\n\n612.\n\nPut differently, by the time Discovery decided to invest in the Slovak Republic in March 2014, it was \u2013 or should have been \u2013 aware that EU law required member States to impose a preliminary EIA for \"deep drills\", and that infringement proceedings were pending against the Slovak Republic in this respect. The Claimant therefore could not legitimately expect that the Slovak Republic would not amend the EIA Act and thereby continue to be non-compliant with the EIA Directive.1088 Any reasonable exercise in due diligence would have put the Claimant on notice of the coming change in Slovak law.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that, pursuant to the complaint procedure in Article 19 of the EIA Act, anyone from the public is entitled to file a reasoned request that the authorities determine whether an activity that is not listed in Annex 8 must undergo a preliminary EIA. Consequently, AOG could not exclude the possibility prior to 2017 of having to perform a preliminary EIA (and eventually a full EIA) as a result of a complaint procedure under Article 19 of the EIA Act. EIA Act, Article 19 (R-45).\n\n613.\n\nIt follows that the EIA Amendment applied to AOG's activities from 1 January 2017 onwards and that AOG would have to perform preliminary EIAs for new drillings below 600 meters.1089 This was irrespective of whether the Exploration Licenses had been issued at an earlier date and the Slovak Republic had approved the Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba wells in 2015.1090\n\nAs Minister S\u00f3lymos confirmed. Tr. (Day 3), 186:18-187:14 (S\u00f3lymos). See also S\u00f3lymos WS1, para. 13 (\"The Amendment thus does not apply to exploration activity, it applies to specific exploration drills. Those that were executed before 1 January 2017 are not subject to the Amendment, but it applies to all new exploration drills after 1 January 2017\").\n\nMemorial, para. 176; Reply, paras. 150-151.\n\n614.\n\nAs to the first point, the Claimant understood at the time that a decision on a preliminary EIA \"can only be carried out with respect to a specific exploration drill and its impact on the environment, but not in relation to exploration drills in general, nor to their general impacts within a certain area, without the specific exploration drill being precisely specified\".1091 As to the second point, although the Slovak Republic had approved drilling at Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba in 2015, the Hearing confirmed that no drilling had begun before 1 January 2017.1092 Specifically, it is undisputed that AOG never drilled at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba. As regards Smilno, the Claimant and its witnesses consistently spoke of three failed drilling attempts. In fact, in June 2016 AOG drove a surface conductor 21 meters into the ground, but activists prevented it from setting \"the conductor pipe in the hole\".1093 The Claimant's technical expert, Mr. Moy, stated that drilling only begins once the surface conductor is in the ground since its purpose is to prevent caving around the drill bit.1094 Be this as it may, AOG agreed in April 2017 to perform preliminary EIAs for all its drilling locations as a result of its engagement with local activists and environmental organizations.1095\n\nEmail of 9 March 2017 from V. Beran to [REDACTED] , p. 3 (R-179).\n\nTr. (Day 3), 186:18-187:14 (S\u00f3lymos). See also S\u00f3lymos WS1, para. 13 (\"The Amendment thus does not apply to exploration activity, it applies to specific exploration drills. Those that were executed before 1 January 2017 are not subject to the Amendment, but it applies to all new exploration drills after 1 January 2017\").\n\nLewis WS1, para. 66. Immediately before AOG's second drilling attempt, it told its JV Partners on 15 June 2016 that the conductor casing would be installed between 17 and 20 June, that it would circulate \"the drilling contract with bid analysis by June 20th\" and that the plan was \"to mobilize the[] rig on July 4th with an anticipated spud date of July 10th\" (AOG's internal report: weekly status report, 15 June 2016, p. 3 of the pdf document (C-135)). After protestors had prevented AOG from proceeding with its plans, Mr. Lewis reported on 20 June 2016 to the JV Partners that AOG \"did NOT get conductor pipe set\" and that the decision was taken \"NOT run and cement conductor casing in hole\" (Email of 28 June 2016 from Michael Lewis, pp. 1 and 5 of the pdf document (C-327)). During a meeting of the operating committee on 8 November 2016, AOG told its JV Partners that the \"well will now be drilled with LWD [i.e., logging while drilling] instead of MWD [i.e., measurement while drilling]\" and the partners agreed to negotiating a drilling contract with the company G-Drilling SA, thus confirming that the actual drilling had not yet commenced (Opcom Minutes, 8 November 2016, p. 2 (C-342); Resolution of Operating Committee, 8 November 2016 (C-343)). Similarly, in its letter of 21 December 2016 to Minister S\u00f3lymos, AOG stated that it did not agree to voluntarily carry out a preliminary EIA for the Smilno and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka wells because \"drillholes should have been drilled more than 12 months ago\", further adding that \"if the drilling in the Smilno site well does not commence by the end of January 2017\", AOG would consider leaving Slovakia (Letter of 21 December 2016 to the Ministry of Environment, p. 2 (C-162)).\n\nTr.

Mr. Fraser explained that, \"[b]y early 2017\", \"[w]e were coming to the conclusion that it was effectively impossible to proceed without establishing some sort of dialogue with the activists opposed to our operations, in order to hear their concerns (even though we considered them misplaced) and attempt to find some common ground\". He added that, after initially demanded that no drilling occur, the activists were of the view that \"[t]he most important element in promoting trust would be to comply voluntarily with the new preliminary EIA process for all wells\". In the end, and \"after some hesitation\", AOG \"agreed to undergo the preliminary EIA\". Fraser WS1, paras. 92 and 94-95. See also Memorial, paras. 180-182 and 237(1).\n\n615.\n\nFinally, the Claimant cannot rely on the public statements of Minister S\u00f3lymos or the MoE between November 2016 and February 2017 as a basis of any legitimate expectation, since they postdate Discovery's investment decision.1096 In any event, those statements do not say that AOG was \"under no legal obligation to conduct an EIA\". Nor do they evince that Minister S\u00f3lymos uttered \"repeated requests\" to AOG leaving it \"with no other option\" but to agree to voluntary EIAs.1097 Rather, they were made in the broader context of Minister S\u00f3lymos' attempts to contain worsening relations between AOG and local activists after AOG's third drilling attempt at Smilno in November 20161098 and the \"compromise\" proposed at the 15 December 2016 meeting that AOG voluntarily agree to conduct preliminary EIAs for all its drill sites,1099 including those where drilling \u2013 according to his understanding \u2013 had already begun.1100 In the end, none of the statements invoked by the Claimant can reasonably be regarded as exempting AOG from performing preliminary EIAs for exploratory wells deeper than 600 meters.\n\nMemorial, paras. 174-180, referring to Ministry of Environment Press Release, \"L.

Notably, Mr. Fraser qualified Minister S\u00f3lymos' proposal as a \"wish\" (Fraser WS1, para. 91).\n\nBy then, local activists were becoming more vocal and organized, and AOG's activities started raising attention at the national level (Ropa Na V\u00fdchode Article, November 2016 (C-341); Denn\u00edk N, \"She fights against the oil company: I am blocking them with my own body, there is no other way left\", 22 November 2016, p. 4 of the pdf document (R-144)). At the same time, the MoE increasingly came in the crosshairs between its support for AOG's activities and having to address complaints from local residents and activists. For instance, the former Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Ms. Iveta Radi\u010dov\u00e1, criticized Minister S\u00f3lymos for having extended AOG's exploration licenses and called for his resignation (Minister S\u00f3lymos Article, Denn\u00edk N, 3 December 2016 (C-348)).

For completeness, the Tribunal nonetheless addresses below the measures about which the Claimant complains.\n\n**(ii) Even if the Slovak Republic had created any legitimate expectations, it did not frustrate them**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the decisions of the district offices ordering AOG to perform full EIAs for the Smilno, Rusk\u00e1 Poruba and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka wells breached its expectations and precipitated the destruction of its investment in the Slovak Republic (Measures ## 11-13). It further claims that imposing preliminary EIAs for future wells in the new Svidn\u00edk Exploration License area breached its expectation to drill there (Measure # 14).1101\n\nMemorial, para. 238.\n\n618.\n\nThe Respondent objects that the precautionary principle must guide the application of the EIA procedures such that, in case of doubt, a full EIA must be carried out.1102 It stresses that the district offices considered \"numerous complex criteria\" contained in Annex 10 of the EIA Act to determine whether AOG's proposed drills were \"likely\" to have \"significant effects on the environment\".1103\n\nRejoinder, paras. 440-442.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 443-444.\n\nThe EIA decisions (Measures ## 11-13)\n-------------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nAs noted above, following negotiations with local activists in February and March 2017,1104 AOG volunteered to perform preliminary EIAs for its three sites.1105 It hired the environmental consultancy firm Chempro, a.s., to prepare the related applications, which it filed on 6 June 2017 for Smilno, 4 July 2017 for Rusk\u00e1 Poruba and 7 August 2017 for Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka.1106\n\nIn particular, on 24 March 2017, Mr. Fraser stated: \"At least in relation to Ruska Poruba and Kriva Olka, they have agreed that if we conduct the mini-EIA and the results of the EIA are positive, they will not prevent us drilling there. We therefore think it is time to go ahead and start the EIA process in relation to three locations if possible \u2013 Ruska Poruba, Kriva Olka and Smilno \u2013 and maintain the dialogue with the activists.

At the time, Mr. Fraser provided the following explanation to the MoE for not appealing the Bardejov decision:\n\n\"Preliminary EIA decisions in relation to Smilno and Ruska Poruba: We find the lack of reasoning or justification in these decisions, and the unprofessional manner in which they have been prepared [\u2026] to be extremely discouraging. It is for this reason that we concluded there was no point in appealing the decisions, since the appeal is to a similar authority, and the message to Alpine from these decisions seemed to be pretty clear. If we appeal and the process is handled in the same way, we just create one more unwelcome precedent for future applications. Nevertheless, we are willing to appeal against the Ruska Poruba decision as you suggested, to see if this results in a fairer process\".1110\n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment appeal against the Humenn\u00e9 District Office decision, 6 October 2017 (C-181).\n\nDistrict Authority Pre\u0161ov: Environment Impact Assessment Decision on the appeal Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, 11 January 2018 (C-184).\n\nEmail of 5 October 2017 from Alexander Fraser, p. 1 (C-383).\n\n622.\n\nDiscovery considers that the district offices should not have processed the EIA applications, since AOG underwent the EIA procedure on a voluntary basis.1111 It also finds the district offices' decisions arbitrary, unfair and lacking a \"rational foundation of fact and/or expert opinion\",1112 and, for the Bardejov and Humenn\u00e9 decisions, lacking any finding that the drilling activities would have significant effects on the environment.1113 As for the Medzilaborce decision, says the Claimant, although the district office did conclude that AOG's activities were likely to have a significant impact on the environment, it did so on pretextual grounds without an objective basis.1114\n\nReply, paras. 179 and 335(1).\n\nReply, paras. 166-175 and 311(2).\n\nReply, para. 168(1).\n\nReply, para. 168(2).\n\n623.\n\nIn the Tribunal's assessment, when AOG filed its EIA Act applications it subjected itself to the preliminary EIA procedure. Once those applications were filed, no matter that they were filed \"voluntarily\", the district offices were bound to process them in accordance with applicable law, that is, pursuant to Article 29 of the EIA Act.\n\n624.\n\nArticle 29 of the EIA Act spells out the requirements and process for a preliminary EIA.\n\nArticle 29(3) of the EIA Act provides that the assessment shall apply the criteria set out in Annex 10 of the EIA Act and consider comments provided by various stakeholders.1115 Article 29(13) of the EIA Act specifies that the decision must be reasoned by reference to the Annex 10 criteria and the comments received:\n\n\"The decision given in the screening procedure shall state, in its reasoning, the grounds on which it is based, an evaluation of criteria referred to in paragraph 3 and an assessment of opinions received under paragraph 9 or Section 23(4)\".1116\n\nThe district offices may subsequently request the applicant to provide additional information \"to clarify the comments and requirements resulting from the opinions\" provided by the authorities and the public.

The district office then provided its reasoning for ordering a full EIA:\n\n\"Bardejov District Office, Department of the Environment, as the competent state administration body [\u2026], assessed the designed construction operation in terms of the significance of the expected impacts on the environment and public health, the state of use of the land and the sustainability of the natural environment, the nature and extent of the designed construction operation, compliance with the land-planning documentation and the level of processing of the designed construction operation. In doing so, it took into account the opinions of the participants in the assessment procedure pursuant to Section 23 subsection 4 of the Act, including the public, and made the ruling as set out in the operative part of this Ruling.\n\nFrom the opinions received on the project proposal and from the measures proposed in the designed construction operation, some specific requirements in relation to the designed construction operation have emerged, which will need to be taken into account in the assessment procedure in the assessment report.\n\n**Other requirements and details will be specified in the scope of the assessment of the designed construction operation, which will be determined by the Bardejov District Office, Department of the Environment in cooperation with the departmental authority, the permitting authority and after discussion with the contracting authority**\".1121\n\nDecision of the Bardejov District Office (Smilno), 2 August 2017 (C-377).\n\nFor instance, the Pre\u0161ov Self-governing Region Authority requested \"a longer investigation and assessment of the designed construction operation\"; the Mikul\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 municipality requested a \"detailed\" assessment \"of the risk of endagenring [sic] the drinking water supply\"; and the Ni\u017en\u00e1 Polianka municipality requested an assessment of the \"designed construction operation/motion\".

AOG did so on 18 December 2017.1123 In a 128-page decision, the district office offered the following reasons for ordering a full EIA:\n\n*\"The competent authority* adequately applied the criteria for the assessment procedure pursuant to \u00a7 29 para. 3 *of the Act on Impact Assessment* listed in Annex no. 10, taking into account also the opinions under \u00a7 23 par. 4 *of the Impact Assessment Act.* In view of the environmental sensitivity of the area concerned, the *competent authority* has decided to further assess, in particular:\n\n*\u2022* The fact that the site of the activity proposed reaches over into the Protected Birds Area of Laborecka [...] part of the continuous European network of protected areas NATURA 2000. [...] Among the activities that are likely to have a significant negative impact on the objects of protection in the locality are the proposed terrain adjustments and changes in outflow conditions.

Hungary*, para. 9.3.40 (RL-62).\n\n630.\n\nBearing in mind these important *caveats*, the Tribunal reviews whether the decisions of the district offices breached FET on the basis of the Claimant's assumed expectation to drill exploration wells. The purpose of the preliminary EIA procedure was to determine whether a full EIA was necessary for AOG's exploration at Smilno, Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka and Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, a determination that would depend on the likelihood or possibility of significant effects on the environment,1128 taking into account the specified criteria, the opinions expressed by stakeholders, and the need for a reasoned decision.\n\nDirective 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, 13 December 2011, Article 1(1) (R-83).\n\n631.\n\nAlthough the Bardejov and Humenn\u00e9 district offices mentioned having assessed the proposed drillings \"in terms of the significance of the expected impacts on the environment and public health\", they only referred to the stakeholder opinions. There is no reference to an evaluation of the relevant criteria. It follows that the Bardejov and Humenn\u00e9 district offices gave insufficient reasons for purposes of the EIA Act. This finding is confirmed by the appellate judgment that repealed the decision of the Humenn\u00e9 District Office for lack of reasons:1129\n\n\"In the reasoning part of a decision, the administrative authority shall state the facts backing the decision, what consideration were taken into account when evidence was assessed, what administrative discretion was applied to the use of legal regulations on which the decision was based, and how the proposals, motions and objections of parties to the proceedings, and their statements concerning the underlying facts were dealt with\".1130\n\nDistrict Authority Presov: Environment Impact Assessment Decision on the appeal Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, 11 January 2018 (C-184).\n\nDistrict Authority Presov: Environment Impact Assessment Decision on the appeal Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, 11 January 2018, p. 9 of the pdf document (C-184).\n\n632.\n\nThat judgement added that a \"reasonable assessment\" of the criteria was \"crucial\" to determine the environmental impact of the proposed activity and had to be \"part of the reasoning part of any decision\" showing which impacts were \"so important\" as to warrant a full EIA.1131\n\nDistrict Authority Presov: Environment Impact Assessment Decision on the appeal Rusk\u00e1 Poruba, 11 January 2018, p. 10 of the pdf document (C-184).\n\n633.\n\nUnlike the Humenn\u00e9 decision, the one issued by the Medzilaborce district office conforms to the requirements of the EIA Act. Having sought additional information from AOG and provided it with an opportunity to comment on the stakeholder opinions, that district office referred to the criteria of Annex 10 and held that significant environmental effects could not be excluded because the drill site was located within a protected area and close to water resources.\n\n634.\n\nIt follows that Discovery's claim in respect of the Medzilaborce district office fails because the decision is sufficiently reasoned for the purposes of the EIA Act. As for the Humenn\u00e9 decision, the claim fails as the decision was annulled on appeal.\n\n635.\n\nBy contrast, the reasoning of the Bardejov decision was formally deficient. That being said, the Tribunal does not view that shortcoming as rising to the level of a treaty breach. The district office was confronted with requests for a full EIA from numerous stakeholders and erred on the side of caution. More importantly, there is no indication that it would have reached a different conclusion if it had expressly referred to the Annex 10 criteria.1132 Nor is there any suggestion that the decision was \"pre-determined\" or based on a \"pretextual justification\".1133\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this context that, on 30 November 2017, the Bardejov District Office sent to AOG a \"scope of assessment\" for the full EIA pursuant to Article 30 of the EIA Act, which reveals the main concerns the district office had in relation to potentially adverse environmental impacts. Therein, AOG was requested to assess (i) the impact of chemicals used in the drilling muds, including a description of the chemicals used, (ii) the impact of produced waste, including drilling waste, (iii) the impact of potential accidents, and (iv) the risks and impacts on water resources, including local drinking water. AOG was further requested to (v) elaborate on the \"retaining drainage area around the drilling site\" and provide \"a list of pollutants and volumes of pollutants and propose measures for elimination of pollution of surface and ground water and propose a control system for timely detection of pollutant leaks\", and (vi) provide a list of \"all the sources of air pollution within the area and functional unit\". Decision of the District Office Bardejov, 30 November 2017, sections 2.2.1 to 2.2.6 (R-193).\n\nReply, paras. 180-184.\n\n636.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal denies the Claimant's request for adverse inferences from the Respondent's failure to produce preliminary drafts or documents recording internal discussions of the district offices.\n\n637.\n\nIn any event, AOG had the right to appeal the Bardejov decision, but chose not to do so. It gave no convincing reason for this choice. Nor did it offer a convincing explanation for not pursuing its operations at Rusk\u00e1 Poruba.\n\n638.\n\nThe Tribunal's point is not that the Claimant had an obligation to exhaust local remedies and then failed to do so, which is not required under the ICSID Convention. Rather, it is that the Claimant did not establish that the decision at issue resulted from gross insufficiencies in the legal system which crossed the threshold necessary to give rise to an FET breach. Though the reasoning of the Bardejov decision did not conform to the statutory requirements, the Tribunal does not see in that failure any prejudice or bias against AOG or any subversion of the Slovak legal system or the rule of law generally such as to harm AOG. To wit, AOG successfully appealed the decision of the Humenn\u00e9 District Office to the Pre\u0161ov regional office, the same appeal body that would have reviewed the Bardejov decision had AOG elected to challenge that decision.\n\n639.\n\nFor these reasons, even if it were to accept that the Claimant could expect to drill exploration wells, the Tribunal would dismiss the claims in relation to Measures ## 11-13.\n\nThe order to perform preliminary EIAs for all future wells (Measure # 14)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n640.\n\nIt is the Claimant's further submission that imposing preliminary EIAs for all future exploration wells in the 2018 renewal of the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License breached its expectations.1134 It argues that such imposition contradicted the \"clear and repeated specific statements\" of the MoE and Minister S\u00f3lymos that the EIA Amendment would not apply to AOG's exploration wells.1135 Moreover, says Discovery, that requirement delayed the permitting process and \"precipitated\" the withdrawal of Romgaz, destroying the value of the investment.1136 The Respondent disputes this submission.\n\nMemorial, paras. 192-195; Reply, paras. 193 and 314.\n\nMemorial, para. 193; Reply, para. 314.\n\nMemorial, para. 193; Reply, para. 193.\n\n641.\n\nThe record shows that on 30 April 2018, AOG applied to reduce the area of the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License.1137 On 8 June 2018, the MoE granted the application by issuing a new license for a smaller area. The new license provided that AOG would perform a preliminary EIA pursuant to Article 29 of the amended EIA Act for exploration drills deeper than 600 meters.1138 That provision simply reflected the statutory obligation for deep exploration drilling found in the amended EIA Act, which had come into force on 1 January 2017 and applied to all future drills.\n\nSee Decision Modifying an Exploration Area, Record No.: 31581/2018, Dossier No.: 6109/2018-5.3, 8 June 2018, condition no. 2, p. 4 of the pdf document (C-15).\n\nDecision Modifying an Exploration Area, Record No.: 31581/2018, Dossier No.: 6109/2018-5.3, 8 June 2018, p. 5 of the pdf document (C-15).\n\n642.\n\nTherefore, even if the Tribunal were to accept that the Claimant could expect to conduct its exploration program, *quod non*, the Claimant cannot successfully complain that the specification in the renewed license breached any such expectation and the Tribunal consequently would also dismiss the claim in relation to Measure # 14.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n643.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent did not generate any expectations in connection with the EIA procedures and more generally with respect to its drilling plans. Even if it had generated any such expectations, the Respondent did not frustrate them.\n\n**iii. Inconsistent treatment**\n-------------------------------\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that the Slovak Republic breached the FET standard through inconsistent conduct. Specifically, it alleges that:1139\n\n\u2022 as regards Smilno,\n\no there were inconsistencies between, on the one hand, the mayor's statements about the Access Road and official maps showing that the road was public and, on the other hand, the conduct of the police and the Ministry of Interior that refused to accept that the Access Road was a PSPR (Measures ## 1, 6 and 7);1140\n\no the police was internally inconsistent in relation to the road signage scheme (Measure # 6);1141\n\n\u2022 on Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka,\n\no the MoA acted inconsistently by first approving the Lease and then refusing to extend it (Measure # 8);\n\no the MoE was inconsistent when refusing to grant the compulsory access order, first by reversing course because of an instruction \"from above\" and by suspending the resumed Article 29 proceedings (Measures ## 9 and 10);1142\n\n\u2022 about the EIA proceedings,\n\no the positions adopted by the district offices in ordering a full EIA were inconsistent with earlier statements that AOG's exploration had no significant adverse impact on the environment (Measures ## 11-13);1143\n\no the MoE's decision to impose a preliminary EIA for future exploration wells was also inconsistent with these statements (Measure # 14).1144\n\nMemorial, paras. 129(3), 141(1), 184, 194, 213(2), 217-218, 230-231, 233-234; Reply, paras. 315-324; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 162.\n\nReply, paras. 59-61 and 316(1)(a)-(c) and (2); Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 162.\n\nReply, paras. 101-102 and 316(1)(d); Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 162.\n\nReply, paras. 135-138 and 317; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 162.\n\nReply, paras. 172-175 and 318(1); Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 162.\n\nReply, paras. 309 and 318(2), Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 162.\n\n645.\n\nThe Respondent challenges this claim. It is of the view that:1145\n\n\u2022 as regards Smilno,\n\no no governmental authority ever stated that the Access Road was a PSPR;1146\n\no the same applies to the official maps that do not identify that field track as a PSPR;1147\n\no the Claimant misinterprets AOG's meeting with Mr. [REDACTED] on 15 July 2016 about the road signage scheme;1148\n\no there is no inconsistency between the positions adopted by the MoI and the MoT, since the latter was only opining on an abstract question;1149\n\n\u2022 with respect to Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka,\n\no the MoA refused to approve the Lease Amendment because AOG failed to comply with the terms for an extension;1150\n\no the MoE suspended the Article 29 proceedings because AOG failed to prove that no new lease was possible and ended the proceedings because AOG relinquished its exploration license;1151\n\n\u2022 as to the EIA procedures,\n\no there is no inconsistency between Minister S\u00f3lymos' statements or the MoE press releases and the decision by the district offices to order full EIAs;1152\n\no the imposition of the obligation to perform preliminary EIA for all future exploration wells simply reflected a statutory obligation.1153\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 184-188.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 185.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 185.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 185.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 186.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 187.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 187.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 188.\n\nRespondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 188.\n\n646.\n\nAs discussed above, the FET standard requires consistency in State conduct dealing with foreign investments in the sense that one branch of the State cannot affirm what another branch of the State denies.1154 When evaluating consistency an important factor is whether a State organ makes statements which fall within its sphere of competence.\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, para. 158 (CL-27). See also *Crystallex International v. Venezuela*, para. 579 (CL-26).\n\n647.\n\nFor substantially the same reasons discussed in the previous sections, the Tribunal fails to see any inconsistency in Slovakia's conduct. Starting with Smilno, the Tribunal's analysis has shown that Slovak authorities, including the police, the mayor, the district office, the MoI and Slovak courts, consistently rejected the PSPR argument. As regards the road signage scheme more specifically, the Director of the Bardejov police force, Mr. [REDACTED],\n\nmerely suggested during the informal meeting of 15 July 2016 that AOG attempt to get road signs erected. He did not assure that such scheme would be approved, perhaps for the very reason that that he had no authority to give any such assurances.1155 Further, the Claimant has not alleged, let alone demonstrated by convincing evidence, that anyone within the District Traffic Inspectorate of the Bardejov police force made any inconsistent statements.1156\n\nSee Email of 16 July 2016 from Matej S\u0177kora (C-331).\n\nThe fact that Mr. [REDACTED] allegedly told AOG on 26 October 2016, i.e. after the road signage scheme had been rejected, that the Access Road was a \"public road\", but \"also a field track\", is not inconsistent with the directorate's determination that it was not a PSPR. See Email of 26 October 2016 from A. Fraser to [REDACTED] (R-159).\n\n648.\n\nIn relation to Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, the Tribunal also refers to the analysis above showing that neither the MoA nor the MoE acted inconsistently. There is no inconsistency in the MoA approving the original Lease and not approving the Lease Amendment because AOG's request for extension was late and did not conform to the terms of the Lease (see paragraphs 559 to 575 above). As for the MoE, the existence of an instruction from the higher levels of the Ministry is not established, it being specified that the record does not convincingly show that Mr. [REDACTED] gave assurances about the outcome of the Article 29 proceedings, nor that he had the authority to give such representations in the first place (see paragraphs 576 to 592 above). Furthermore, there is no inconsistency in the context of the MoE's suspension of the Article 29 proceedings (see paragraphs 593 to 600 above).\n\n649.\n\nFinally, there is no inconsistency in respect of the EIA process. The Claimant's reliance on various statements of the district offices predating the entry into force of the EIA\n\nAmendment is inapposite, since no preliminary EIA was required at the time. Those statements were made in a different context and based on regulations other than those under consideration in a preliminary EIA procedure. This is in particular so because the latter concerns a specific activity at a specific site requiring an evaluation of specific environmental risks under the EIA Act.1157 In the same vein, the MoE's statement of 15 February 2017 that its inspection at Smilno had not revealed any \"suspicion\" of groundwater pollution and Minister S\u00f3lymos' statements in January 2017 assuring the local population that AOG's activities would not adversely impact the environment cannot be viewed as inconsistent with the decisions ordering full EIAs.1158 Finally, there is no inconsistency either between statements of Slovak officials, in particular those of Minister S\u00f3lymos, and the imposition of a preliminary EIA for future exploratory wells below 600 meters. Minister S\u00f3lymos consistently said that the EIA Amendment would apply to all such exploratory wells from 1 January 2017.1159 The Claimant pointed to no representation that AOG would be exempted from the application of the amended EIA Act.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor instance, the statement of the Pre\u0161ov District Office on 16 January 2015 that \"there is no assumption of its significant impact\" on a protected bird area in the Natura 2000 network was made under the Nature Protection Act and, as the Respondent rightly says, concerned a much narrower question than what was being assessed under the EIA Act (Expert Opinion of 16 January 2015 of the District Office in Pre\u0161ov (C-265)). Similarly, the statement of the Medzilaborce District Office on 23 January 2015 that drilling at Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka would \"not have a significant impact\" on the habitats of wild fauna and flora concerned a narrower scope than the one under the EIA Act (Statement of 23 January 2015 of the District Office in Medzilaborce (C-266)).\n\nMoE Statement \u2013 The inspection of the geological survey did not show any serious irregularities, 15 February 2017 (C-168); Korzar Article \u2013 Minister Comments on the Borehole Near Smilno, 27 January 2017 (C-164).\n\nMinister S\u00f3lymos was reported saying that, under the EIA Amendment, \"new exploratory wells are subject to an environmental impact assessment process\", that \"[a]nybody, who would today intend to apply for an exploration area and do any test drilling, will be required to carry out a screening/fact-finding procedure\", and that, in contrast to \"old wells\", \"[n]ew exploratory wells are already subject to environmental impact assessment\". Ministry of Environment Press Release, 17 January 2017 (C-163); Korzar Article \u2013 Minister Comments on the Borehole Near Smilno, 27 January 2017, p. 2 of the pdf document (C-164); Ministry of Environment Press Release, 15 February 2017 (C-168).\n\n650.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Slovak Republic did not act inconsistently and, hence, there is no breach of the FET standard on this count.\n\n**iv. Arbitrary and non-transparent treatment**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nIt is the Claimant's assertion that the measures discussed above were arbitrary and adopted in a non-transparent way. Specifically, it puts forward that:1160\n\n\u2022 in relation to Smilno,\n\no the police's refusal to accept that the Access Road was publicly accessible was arbitrary and abusive;1161\n\no the same is true of the conduct of Dr. Slosar\u010dikov\u00e1 during AOG's second drilling attempt in June 2016;1162\n\no the same is equally true of the police's refusal to approve the road signage scheme in October 2016;1163\n\n\u2022 in connection with Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka,\n\no the MoA acted arbitrarily and in a non-transparent manner when refusing to approve the Lease Amendment;\n\no the MoE did so by refusing to grant a compulsory access order and by suspending the resumed Article 29 proceedings;1164\n\n\u2022 in respect of the EIA process,\n\no the decisions of the district offices ordering full EIAs \"involved an arbitrary application of the EIA Act and/or an abuse of power\";\n\no the same applies to the MoE's imposition of the obligation to perform preliminary EIAs for future wells.1165\n\nMemorial, paras. 213(4), 244-245 and 252-257; Reply, paras. 325-336; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 163\n\nReply, para. 329.\n\nReply, para. 330.\n\nReply, para. 331.\n\nReply, paras. 332-334.\n\nReply, paras. 335-336.\n\n652.\n\nThe Respondent challenges these contentions and argues that:1166\n\n\u2022 regarding Smilno,\n\no the police could not remove vehicles or disperse protestors situated on the Access Road, since that field track was on private land;1167\n\no the State prosecutor had no authority to intervene in the absence of any criminal conduct;1168\n\no the police could not approve the road signage scheme since the Access Road was not a PSPR.1169\n\n\u2022 about Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka,\n\no the MoA's refusal to approve the Lease extension was \"completely justifiable\" since the Lease had expired;1170\n\no there was no instruction from \"officials higher up\" in the MoE;1171\n\no the resumed Article 29 proceedings had to be suspended to ensure that AOG and LSR could not agree on a new lease.1172\n\n\u2022 as regards the EIA process,\n\no the preliminary EIA decisions complied with the precautionary principle under EU law, the Claimant chose not to appeal two decisions, and although it successfully appealed one decision \"it stopped [pursuing] the remanded proceedings\";1173\n\no imposing a preliminary EIA on post-2017 drills, even if wrong, \"cannot possibly rise to the levels required to constitute arbitrariness under the FET standard\".1174\n\nRejoinder, paras. 427-473; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 189-195.\n\nRejoinder, para. 430.\n\nRejoinder, para. 431.\n\nRejoinder, para. 432.\n\nRejoinder, para. 433.\n\nRejoinder, para. 435.\n\nRejoinder, para. 436.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 437-473.\n\nRejoinder, para. 473.\n\n653.\n\nA violation of domestic law does not breach the FET standard unless it is abusive or arbitrary. As stated in *Musznianka:*\n\n\"Non-compliance with domestic laws by State authorities may form the basis of a successful FET claim, if (i) there is proof of arbitrary conduct in the application of the laws in question; or (ii) there is some form of abuse of power\".1175\n\n*Muszynianka sp\u00f3\u0142ka v. Slovak Republic*, para. 467 (RL-65); *Crystallex International v. Venezuela*, para. 552 (CL-26).\n\n654.\n\nFor the reasons already reviewed in detail above, the Tribunal considers that the conduct of the Slovak Republic does not qualify as arbitrary or abusive.1176 No element in the record suggests that the disputed measures were adopted in pursuance of ulterior motives such as to harass AOG or to prevent it from conducting its activities. To the contrary, the overall impression that emerges from the record is that the Slovak authorities were largely supportive of AOG's operations, sought to defuse tensions with local activists and corrected on appeal mistakes that first-instance decision-makers may have made.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor Smilno, see paragraphs 511 to 520 andXXXX 528 to 550, it being recalled that the Claimant accepted that all of its claims regarding events at Smilno in 2015 and 2016 fail if the Tribunal concluded, as it did, that Interim Injunction was properly issued (Tr. (Day 6), 80:8-13 (Tushingham)). For Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka, see paragraphs 559 to 600, and for the EIA decisions, see paragraphs 619 to 642.\n\n655.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot but dismiss this claim.\n\n**v. Denial of justice**\n------------------------\n\n656.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Slovak judiciary violated the FET standard by arbitrarily prohibiting AOG from using the Access Road.1177 It contends that the decision of the Bardejov District Court granting the Interim Injunction and the one of the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court upholding that injunction were arbitrary and biased against AOG.1178\n\nMemorial, paras. 219-223; Reply, paras. 337-348; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 164-165.\n\nMemorial, para. 229; Reply, para. 343.\n\n657.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant argues, first, that the conditions for granting the Interim Injunction were not fulfilled since Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 did not establish \"significant, serious and even irreparable harm\", a requirement settled in \"long-standing decisions of the Slovak Supreme Court\".1179 Second, the courts' failure to decide whether the Access Road was publicly accessible was arbitrary since that was a \"fundamental question\" and the courts \"trespassed upon the competence of the competent administrative body\".1180 Third, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's conduct \"disentitled her\" from obtaining the Interim Injunction.1181 Fourth, the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies for a denial of justice finding should not apply because any appeal would have been futile due to the \"unwarranted delays\" in maintaining the Interim Injunction in force after June 2016.1182\n\nReply, para. 345.\n\nReply, para. 346.\n\nReply, para. 347.\n\nReply, para. 348.\n\n658.\n\nThe Respondent denies having committed a denial of justice.1183 The threshold for a denial of justice, it argues, is \"particularly high\", only flagrant systemic failures of the judiciary being subject to sanction.1184 It argues that the Claimant failed to demonstrate that the impugned decisions rested on an \"exceptionally outrageous or monstrously grave\" misapplication of Slovak law, or were \"biased, arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic\".1185 First, the statutory conditions for the Interim Injunction were fulfilled.1186 Second, neither court was obliged to deal *ex officio* with the status of the Access Road, especially considering that AOG had not pleaded that the road was publicly accessible but rather that it was a co-owner of that road.1187 Third, there is no support for the assertion that Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's conduct disentitled her from obtaining the interim relief.1188 Fourth, the Claimant provides no support for its assertion that seeking to exhaust local remedies would have been futile,1189 not to speak of the fact that no delays occurred during the first instance and appellate proceedings.1190\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 356-373; Rejoinder, paras. 474-491; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 196-200.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 356; Rejoinder, paras. 474-480.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 368 and 373; Rejoinder, para. 491.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 370; Rejoinder, para. 482.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 371; Rejoinder, paras. 483-487.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 372; Rejoinder, para. 488.\n\nRejoinder, para. 489.\n\nRejoinder, para. 490.\n\n659.\n\nThe Tribunal has already stated above (paragraphs 420 and 421) that, in addition to a procedural denial of justice, the State's judiciary can breach FET by reaching manifestly arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic decisions. An error in the application or interpretation of domestic law without more is not a treaty breach. What is needed is an error that \"no merely competent judge could have committed\", showing that no \"minimally adequate system of justice\" was provided.1191 Accordingly, as noted above, the Tribunal can only step in if there is evidence before it of some \"severe impropriety\".1192 In addition, it must be noted that denial of justice sanctions the failure of a system as a whole, which explains the reason for the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies.1193 Exhaustion allows the judicial system to correct possible mistakes.\n\n*Iberdrola Energ\u00eda S.A. v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5, Award, 17 August 2012, para. 432 (RL-79).\n\n*Jan de Nul v. Egypt*, para. 206 (CL-29).\n\nSee, for instance, *ECE v.

Slovak Republic*, para. 225 (RL-75).\n\n660.\n\nThe Claimant's denial of justice claim contains four prongs. The Tribunal already rejected the first three prongs in its analysis above (paragraphs 511 to 520). The fourth prong, which is addressed below, relates to alleged undue delays in the court proceedings.\n\n661.\n\nOn 20 June 2016, AOG acknowledged Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's claim that the purchase agreement of 17 December 2015 was \"null and void\"1194 and, on 11 July 2016, it filed a motion to cancel the Interim Injunction. Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 commented on that motion on 16 September 2016.1195 On 5 October 2016, the Bardejov District Court issued a judgment recognizing Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's claim1196 and, on 11 October 2016, it asked AOG to comment within 15 days whether it insisted on its motion to cancel the Interim Injunction. However, AOG only filed its comments on 2 December 2016, which the court received on 12 December 2016.1197 In the meantime, although she had prevailed, Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 filed an appeal on 23 November 2016 against the 5 October 2016 judgment.1198 It is clear that her intent was to keep the Interim Injunction in force during the appeal.1199\n\nLetter of 20 June 2016 from AOG to the District Court Bardejov (LF-23); Letter of 20 June 2016 from Mr. [REDACTED] to the District Court Bardejov (LF-22); Judgment of the District Court Bardejov, File No. 1C/29/2016-268, 5 October 2016, para. 14 (LF-16).\n\nSee Repeated Request of AOG to District Court Bardejov, 2 December 2016 (LF-24).\n\nJudgment of the District Court Bardejov, File No. 1C/29/2016-268, 5 October 2016, para. 14 (LF-16).\n\nRepeated Request of AOG to District Court Bardejov, 2 December 2016 (LF-24).\n\nAppeal of 23 November 2016 filed by Mrs. Varjanov\u00e1 (C-155). The 5 October 2016 judgment had been served on Ms. Varjanov\u00e1 on 8 November 2016 (see Submission Report of District Court Bardejov, 12 January 2017, p. 1 of the pdf document (LF-20)).\n\nVarjanov\u00e1 WS1, para. 38.\n\n662.\n\nEven though her appeal was obstructive and ultimately failed,1200 the fact remains that the courts had to follow certain procedural steps under the Code of Civil Procedure to address that appeal. On 24 November 2016, the Bardejov District Court invited AOG and the other respondent, Mr. [REDACTED] , who received the notice on 2 and 5 December 2016 respectively, to comment on the appeal within ten days, which AOG did on 12 December 2016.1201 As Dr. Foga\u0161 explained,1202 as Mr. [REDACTED] had not filed any comments within the time-limit of 15 December 2016, the court waited to see if comments were still forthcoming. Apparently as a result and due to the holiday season, the file was not forwarded to the appellate court until 12 January 2017.1203 That court then dismissed the appeal on 27 February 2017,1204 i.e. one and a half months after receiving the file. The Bardejov District Court received that decision on 4 April 2017 and, according to the Claimant, it was communicated to the litigants on 2 May 2017.1205 That decision then entered into force on 19 May 2017, when it was \"served on the last party to the proceedings\", it being specified that the courts have \"no control over\" the moment such decision becomes final, since they must wait for proof of receipt.1206\n\n\u0160tev\u010dek ER1, para. 40; Foga\u0161 ER1, para. 84.\n\nRepeated Request of AOG to District Court Bardejov, 2 December 2016 (LF-24).\n\nFoga\u0161 ER1, para. 88; Foga\u0161 ER2, para. 48.\n\nSubmission Report of District Court Bardejov, 12 January 2017 (LF-20).\n\nResolution of the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court, 27 February 2017 (C-170).\n\nThe Resolution of the Pre\u0161ov Regional Court is stamped as being received by the Bardejov District Court on 4 April 2017.

Other delays are attributable to the parties. That two-month delay can in no way justify a finding of denial of justice in the circumstances of this case.1207\n\nIt is noted that the Slovak Supreme Court held that issuing a decision on appeal within one year was timely (Resolution of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic, File No. I. US 399/2019-11, 26 September 2019 (LF-21)).\n\n**c. Conclusion on FET**\n------------------------\n\n664.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not breach its FET obligations. The failure of AOG's drilling project was largely a consequence of its own actions and inactions. In summary:\n\n\u2022 At Smilno, there is no evidence that AOG performed a meaningful exercise in due diligence on the status of the Access Road, and the evidence makes clear that it sought to use that field track without the owners' consent. Once it realized that its understanding about the legal status of the field track was incorrect and that its actions were stirring up local resistance, instead of engaging with the land owners and activists, it resorted to self-help and further antagonized its opponents by disregarding the Interim Injunction issued by the local court, upgrading and repeatedly using the field track.\n\n\u2022 As for Kriv\u00e1 Ol'ka, the origin of the troubles seem to lie in the failure of AOG to request the Lease extension on time, although it had secured all the permits. It then sought a compulsory access order and successfully appealed the first instance decision that had denied the order, but then decided not to pursue those proceedings, which was a surprising failure.\n\n\u2022 Similarly, in respect of the EIAs, AOG decided to relinquish the Snina Exploration License although it had successfully appealed against the decision of the Humenn\u00e9 District Office that ordered it to conduct a full EIA and chose not to appeal the EIA decisions concerning Smilno and Kriv\u00e1 O\u013eka.\n\n665.\n\nIt is true that some of the Slovak authorities made certain decisions which give rise to questions. For instance, the MoA may have been excessively formalistic in not approving the Lease extension. The first instance decision of the MoE refusing a compulsory access order was arguable, but was ultimately quashed. In the same vein, although the reasons given by the district offices to order full EIAs were not in conformity with the statutory requirements, they were neither arbitrary nor biased. In addition, remedies were available against those decisions and, when AOG made use of those remedies, they were effective. In the end, these questionable decisions caused no more than temporary setbacks, which did not prevent AOG from conducting its exploration program.\n\n**4. Arbitrary and discriminatory treatment**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**i. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n666.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's conduct was arbitrary and discriminatory and therefore in breach of Article II(1) and II(2)(b) of the BIT.1208 Regarding arbitrary treatment, the Claimant reiterates the arguments addressed above. Regarding discrimination, the Claimant contends that \"without any reasonable or objective justification\" the Slovak Republic treated NAFTA more favorably than AOG when (i) the MoE granted NAFTA a compulsory access order,1209 (ii) the MoA approved a four-year lease in favor of NAFTA,1210 and (iii) the MoE only imposed on AOG the obligation to perform preliminary EIAs for all future deep drills in a decision reducing the license area, whereas that obligation was imposed on other license holders in licenses renewals.1211\n\nMemorial, paras. 155-157, 194 and 239-257; Reply, paras. 349-369; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slides 163 and 166.\n\nMemorial, paras. 249-250; Reply, paras. 359-361.\n\nMemorial, paras. 251-253; Reply, para. 362-366.\n\nMemorial, para. 257; Reply, paras. 367-369.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n667.\n\nThe Respondent disputes this claim and argues that NAFTA is not an appropriate comparator because, as AOG, it is a Slovakian entity, controlled by a foreign national, such that \"there can be no element of nationality-based discrimination\".1212 Second, NAFTA was not treated more favorably by the MoE or the MoA.1213 It took the MoE three years to process NAFTA's request for a compulsory access order and NAFTA complied with the MoE's requests for additional documents.1214 Further, the MoE imposed the obligation to perform preliminary EIAs in \"numerous cases\" after 1 January 2017.1215 As for the MoA, NAFTA and AOG were not in like circumstances since AOG had failed to seek a timely Lease extension.1216\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 385-386; Rejoinder, paras. 496-497.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 387-395; Rejoinder, paras. 498-505; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 202.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 387-391; Rejoinder, paras. 498-502; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 202.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 396-400; Rejoinder, paras. 394 and 506-507; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 202.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 392-395; Rejoinder, paras. 503-505; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slide 202.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n668.\n\nThe Claimant's arguments about arbitrary treatment are in effect identical to the ones that the Tribunal has already dismissed in the context of the FET analysis above at paragraphs 651 to 655. Hence, for substantially the same reasons as above, the Tribunal dismisses the claim for arbitrary treatment.\n\n669.\n\nThe following analysis is thus limited to the discrimination claim.\n\n**i. Applicable legal framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n670.\n\nArticle II(1) of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a nondiscriminatory basis, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of entry into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Annex. Moreover, each Party agrees to notify the other of any future exception with respect to the sectors or matters listed in the Annex, and to limit such exceptions to a minimum. Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, except as stated otherwise in the Annex, be not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies of any third country\".1217\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article II(1) (C-1).\n\n671.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For the purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary and discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party\".1218\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article II(2)(b) (C-1).\n\n672.\n\nDiscrimination exists where an investor suffers \"different treatment in similar circumstances without reasonable justification\".1219 It follows, as noted in *Pawlowski v. Czech Republic*, that the Claimant must (i) identify a suitable comparator that is in like situation, (ii) prove that it suffered less favorable treatment than the comparator, and (iii) establish that there was no reasonable justification for the difference in treatment.1220\n\n*Saluka Investments v. Czech Republic*, para. 313 (CL-11); *Lemire v. Ukraine*, para. 261 (CL-31); *Crystallex International v. Venezuela*, para. 616 (CL-26).\n\n*Pawlowski v. Czech Republic*, para. 534 (CL-44).\n\n**ii. Discussion**\n------------------\n\n673.\n\nThe Tribunal will leave open the question whether Article II(1) and (2)(b) only contemplates nationality-based discrimination and whether NAFTA, a Slovak entity controlled by foreign interests, can be an appropriate comparator. Even if this question were resolved in favor of Discovery, the latter would fail to establish an unjustified difference in treatment.\n\n674.\n\nStarting with the compulsory access order, the record shows that it took the MoE almost two years to process NAFTA's application. When the owner of the forest property appealed the decision granting the compulsory access order, the Minister of Environment quashed the decision and the MoE granted a new compulsory access order in a subsequent procedure.1221 By contrast, it took the MoE around seven months to process AOG's application and, although it first refused to grant the order, Minister S\u00f3lymos quashed that refusal about three months later. More importantly, the Claimant does not contest that NAFTA diligently submitted the documentation requested by the MoE,1222 whereas AOG refused to provide the MoE with evidence that it had failed to secure a new lease from LSR, and it ultimately abandoned the process.1223\n\nNAFTA a.s. section 29 applications dated 2010 (C-32); Decision of the Minister of Environment, 17 May 2013 (R-99).\n\nDecision of the Minister of Environment, 17 May 2013, pp. 2-3 (R-99).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 388 and 390.\n\n675.\n\nTurning then to the MoA's refusal of the Lease extension, the Claimant contends that the process for NAFTA's lease was \"materially different\" because (i) that lease was approved within three months as opposed to six months for AOG's Lease, (ii) the Forestry Property Commission met to consider NAFTA's lease unlike for AOG's Lease extension, and (iii) the decision approving NAFTA's lease was communicated by the Head of the Service Office whereas the one refusing AOG's extension request was communicated by Minister Mate\u010dn\u00e1.1224 Although literally addressing communication, that latter complaint rather seems to go to the identity of the decision-maker.\n\nReply, para. 365.\n\n676.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that the approval of a lease is different from the extension of an existing lease. In this respect, the Claimant did not establish that the Forestry Property Commission was required to meet to consider lease extensions, nor did it rebut the Respondent's assertion that the commission had met to discuss AOG's initial lease. Further, the three month difference in processing the initial leases cannot without more be considered as a sign of discrimination, particularly when AOG knew that the lease approval could take up to six months.1225 Moreover, the Claimant's allegations about the identity of the person who made or communicated the decision do not suggest, let alone prove, discriminatory treatment, not to speak of the fact that one decision was about an initial lease and the other about an extension.\n\nFraser WS1, para. 30; Email of 28 April 2015 from Ron Crow to AOG Team (C-72).\n\n677.\n\nFinally, the MoE's imposition of preliminary EIAs for all deep drillings in the 2018 decision amending the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License was a mere restatement of a statutory obligation. The MoE had included similar requirements in other exploration licenses issued after 1 January 2017, including in a license extension granted to NAFTA.1226 The Claimant's point that these instances concern license extensions as opposed to amendments is a \"distinction without a difference\",1227 and can certainly not as such amount to discrimination.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDecision of MoE on extension of NAFTA a.s. exploration area licence, 19 March 2018 (R-91); Decision of MoE on extension of Ochtin\u00e1 exploration area license, 17 July 2018 (R-100); Decision of MoE on determination of the exploration area to NAFTA a.s., 17 September 2018 (R-180); Decision of MoE on determination of the exploration are to CE Metals s.r.o., 27 January 2017 (R-181).\n\nRejoinder, para. 394.\n\n678.\n\nOn this basis and for reasons set forth at paragraphs 651 to 655, the Tribunal dismisses the claim for arbitrary and discriminatory treatment.\n\n**5. Effective means**\n----------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**i. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n679.\n\nDiscovery claims that the Respondent violated Article II(6) of the BIT by failing to provide effective means,1228 in particular in connection with the \"unwarranted and unreasonable delay\" in dealing with Mrs Varjanov\u00e1's appeal, with the Article 29 Application and with AOG's related appeal.1229 Contrary to the Respondent's argument, the Claimant considers that Article II(6) is sufficiently broad to cover \"authorizations relating\" to investments, which encompass administrative decisions.1230\n\nMemorial, paras. 111-116, 144-154 and 258-262; Reply, paras. 370-372; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 167.\n\nMemorial, para. 262.\n\nReply, para. 371.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n680.\n\nThe Respondent disputes having breached Article II(6) of the BIT.1231 It argues that the effective means standard \"is not absolute\" and \"does not apply in non-adjudicatory administrative decision-making\".1232 Even if that standard applied to the Article 29 proceedings, Slovakia contends that delays were \"caused primarily by AOG's failure to submit\" documents.1233 Similarly, in connection with alleged judicial delays, the courts \"followed the traditional procedural steps\" and \"acted lawfully and without any undue delay\".1234\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 401-408; Rejoinder, paras. 508-514; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 203-204.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 402-403; Rejoinder, paras. 508-512, referring to *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014 (hereinafter \"*Apotex v. USA*\"), para. 9.70 (RL-87).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 408; Rejoinder, para. 513.\n\nRejoinder, para. 514.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**i. Applicable legal framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n681.\n\nArticle II(6) of the BIT reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investments and authorizations relating thereto and investment agreements\".1235\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article II(6) (C-1).\n\n682.\n\nThe wording just quoted is clear; it covers \"authorizations relating\" to investments. In addition to means to enforce rights in court, this effective means provision extends to non-adjudicatory administrative decision-making. In that sense, it differs from the effective means provision of the Jamaica-USA BIT at issue in *Apotex*, on which the Respondent relies.1236\n\n*Apotex v. USA*, para. 9.70 (RL-87).\n\n**ii. Discussion**\n------------------\n\n683.\n\nThe Claimant complains about delays in processing (i) Ms. Varjanov\u00e1's appeal against the 5 October 2016 decision of the Bardejov District Court and (ii) the Article 29 Application.1237 On the first complaint, the Tribunal refers to its analysis in the context of the denial of justice claim at paragraphs 660 to 663 above.\n\nMemorial, paras. 111-116, 144-154 and 262(2); Reply, paras. 133-141 and 372.\n\n684.\n\nAs regards the Article 29 Application, the complaint goes to delays at the first instance and appellate levels.1238 In respect of the first, the Claimant appears to rely on Mr. [REDACTED]'s statement that Article 29 proceedings \"typically\" take two to four months.1239 This timeframe ignores that AOG's original application was incomplete and had to be supplemented.1240 It also disregards that AOG's application was not \"typical\", it involved a lease agreement with an entity administering public lands, which required MoA approval. These specificities inevitably required more time. The MoE had to address whether the MoA was a party to the Article 29 proceedings, and nothing suggests that the MoE or the MoA was inactive or dilatory.1241 By comparison, NAFTA's first instance Article 29 proceedings took nearly two years.1242\n\nMemorial, paras. 144-154 and 262(2); Reply, paras. 133-141 and 372.\n\nReply, para. 135(2), referring to Email of 17 October 2016 from Viktor Beran (C-337).\n\nMinistry of Environment response to AOG Application under s.29 of the Geology Act, 20 September 2016 (C-144).\n\nSection 29 \u2013 various communications between the Ministry of Environment, State Forestry and Ministry of Agriculture, 25 November 2016 (C-156).\n\nNAFTA submitted its Article 29 application on 14 May 2010 and the MoE granted that application on 13 April 2012. NAFTA a.s. section 29 applications dated 2010 (C-32); Decision of the Minister of Environment, 17 May 2013, pp. 1-2 of the pdf document (R-99).\n\n685.\n\nAs to the appeal, AOG filed its appeal on 24 March 2017 and the appellate decision was rendered on 13 June 2017.1243 It is difficult to see where the delay lies. To the extent the Claimant's complaint includes the suspension of the Article 29 proceedings, the Tribunal found above that any delays were of the Claimant's own making.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDecision by the Ministry of Environment regarding the compulsory access order, 6 March 2017 (C-25); Decision of Minister of Environment, 13 June 2017 (C-174). To compare NAFTA's appeal took somewhat longer, as it was filed on 4 May 2012 and the Minister of Environment issued his decision on 21 August 2012. NAFTA a.s. section 29 applications dated 2010 (C-32); Decision of the Minister of Environment, 17 May 2013, pp. 1-2 of the pdf document (R-99).\n\n686.\n\nIn summary, for these reasons and those set out at paragraphs 679 to 682, the Tribunal dismisses the claim that the Respondent breached Article II(6) of the BIT.\n\n**6. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**a. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**i. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n687.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Slovakia breached Article III(1) of the BIT by indirectly expropriating its shareholding in AOG and destroying its investments in the Slovak Republic.1244 For the Claimant, the \"totality of the measures which Slovakia imposed throughout the project between 2015-2018\" amount to a creeping indirect expropriation, the \"cumulative effect\" of which was to substantially deprive the Claimant of the investment's \"value, use or enjoyment\", and to inflict \"a loss of the economic value or economic viability\".1245 Discovery submits that this indirect expropriation was \"unlawful\" because Slovakia did not act for a public purpose, in accordance with due process, in a non-discriminatory manner, and did not provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation.1246\n\nMemorial, paras. 263-269; Reply, paras. 373-381; Claimant's Opening Presentation, Slide 168.\n\nReply, para. 377(1)-(2).\n\nReply, para. 377(3).\n\n688.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the assertion that it voluntarily relinquished the Exploration Licenses and insists that it was forced to do so in 2018 to mitigate its losses resulting from the Respondent's breaches.1247 The argument that AOG had no right to use the Access Road is a \"straw man argument\", since the road was publicly accessible and the police prevented AOG from using it.1248 Moreover, the MoA and the MoE deprived AOG of the economic benefits accruing under the Exploration Licenses.1249 Finally, the decisions ordering a full EIA and the imposition of a preliminary EIA for future wells, although the EIA Amendment did not apply to AOG's activities authorized before its enactment, deprived AOG of the value, use or enjoyment of the Exploration Licenses.1250\n\nReply, para. 376.\n\nReply, para. 379.\n\nReply, para. 380.\n\nReply, para. 381.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n689.\n\nThe Respondent challenges this claim.1251 It stresses that Discovery \"retains its shareholding in AOG\" and that \"it retained all its Exploration Area Licenses until it voluntarily relinquished them\".1252 It adds that it is not established that any assets were taken or that the investment was \"rendered worthless and unviable\".1253\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 409-424; Rejoinder, paras. 515-527; Respondent's Opening Presentation, Slides 205-206.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 417-418; Rejoinder, paras. 517 and 525.\n\nRejoinder, para. 521.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**i. Applicable legal framework**\n---------------------------------\n\n690.\n\nArticle III(1) of the BIT reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization ('expropriation') except for a public purpose; in accordance with due process of law; in a nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2)\".1254\n\nUS-Slovakia BIT, Article III(1) (C-1).\n\n**ii. Discussion**\n------------------\n\n691.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that Discovery still owns the shares in AOG and that AOG relinquished the Medzilaborce and Snina Exploration Licenses in April 2018 and did not seek an extension of the Svidn\u00edk Exploration License, which expired in July 2021.1255\n\nAOG notice of withdrawal from Medzilaborce, 13 April 2018 (C-193); AOG notice of withdrawal from Snina, 13 April 2018 (C-194). See Lewis WS1, para. 93.\n\n692.\n\nThe measures which the Claimant impugns here are the same measures of which it complained in the context of its FET, arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, and effective means claims. All of these measures have been extensively examined above and none has been held to rise to the level of a treaty breach. For reasons of judicial economy, the Tribunal refers to its discussion above. A measure that does not breach FET or a similar standard cannot conceivably constitute an expropriation. The same is true of the cumulative effect of a series of measures. If none represents a breach individually, their addition will not turn them into a breach. Or, differently put, adding zeros will still give zero.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n693.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal dismisses the expropriation claims.\n\n**VII. TRANSPARENCY**\n---------------------\n\n694.\n\nIn conformity with the Parties' consent to publish the Award and the transparency regime set out in PO2, the Award shall be made available to the public. Pursuant to paragraph 23 of PO2, the Parties shall therefore notify the Tribunal within 30 days from the date of dispatch of the Award if they seek protection of confidential information. Pursuant to paragraphs 17 and 18 of PO2, the other Party may then raise reasoned objections to transparency within 30 days and the Parties shall thereafter seek to resolve those objections within 15 days. If necessary, the Tribunal will then rule on any outstanding objections.\n\n695.\n\nIt follows that, as is foreseen in paragraph 22 of PO2, the Tribunal will remain in office until all transparency objections have been resolved.\n\n696.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to paragraph 27(v) of PO2, the documents referred to in Section III of PO2 will, upon completion of the case, continue to be made available to the public on the ICSID website.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**A. Parties' positions**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n697.\n\nThe Claimant seeks recovery of all of its costs incurred in connection with this arbitration based on the principle that costs follow the event. It also claims interest on costs awarded at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date of the Award to payment.1256 Its costs were mostly funded by 24LF Capital LLC (\"24LF\")1257 and the remaining part was either paid directly by Discovery \"or will become payable by Discovery directly in the event of success\".1258\n\nMemorial, paras. 333-334 and 335(4)-(5); Reply, para. 474(8)-(9); Claimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024; Claimant's Reply on the Respondent's Submission on Costs, 24 May 2024.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, para. 4.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, note 2.\n\n698.\n\nIn addition to other costs and expenses, the Claimant claims GBP 1,688,465.55 for Signature's fees and other costs, including a GBP 330,903 success fee,1259 GBP 251,600 for Mr. Tushingham's fees and GBP 42,975 for Mr. Hain's fees.1260 It further claims the ATE insurance premium of USD 209,850 including a premium tax, plus a deferred and contingent premium of USD 544,450.1261 Finally, Discovery claims a return on 24LF's investment being the greater of (i) three times the amount of GBP 2,841,402.96 invested by 24LF, namely GBP 8,524,208.88 or (ii) 30% of all amounts awarded up to USD 50 million, plus 20% of all amounts awarded between USD 50 and 100 million, plus 10% of all amounts awarded over USD 100 million.1262\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, para. 8-14.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, paras. 15-18.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, paras. 31-51, as updated in Claimant's Updated Costs Schedule, 10 January 2025, p. 2.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, paras. 52-57, as updated in Claimant's Updated Costs Schedule, 10 January 2025, p. 2.\n\n699.\n\nThe Claimant argues that these costs and expenses are reasonable, that it acted in good faith throughout the proceedings and that its conduct did not increase the Respondent's costs.1263 It rejects the Respondent's contention that it should not be considered as prevailing unless it succeeds on a majority of the 14 disputed measures or does not succeed on causation or in establishing damages.1264 It also disagrees that the Respondent should be awarded a substantial portion of its costs even if it were to prevail.1265\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, para. 6; Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs, 24 May 2024, paras. 8-13.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, 24 May 2024, para. 4.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, 24 May 2024, para. 5.\n\n700.\n\nOn this basis, using the lower figure of GBP 8,524,208.88 for 24LF's return on investment, the Claimant seeks the following relief:\n\n\"(1) ORDER Slovakia to compensate Discovery for the costs incurred in connection with the arbitration in the amounts of:\n\n(a) GBP [11,204,931.75], plus\n\n(b) EUR 174,725.87, plus\n\n(c) USD [997,515.76]\".1266\n\nEmphasis omitted.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n701.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to award it the totality of its costs, including legal fees, expert fees, arbitral expenses for ICSID and the Tribunal, and other costs, as well as interest on any awarded amount at a reasonable commercial rate from the date of the Award until payment.1267 It claims legal fees and costs for EUR 3,228,596.54 (not including advance payments to ICSID).1268\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 623(b)-(c); Rejoinder, para. 737(b)-(c); Respondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, pp. 1 and 4.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, p. 3 and Annex A, as updated in the Respondent's Updated Statement of Costs, 9 January 2025.\n\n702.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, pursuant to a representation agreement, its counsel Squire Patton Boggs cannot invoice more than EUR 55,000 for legal fees per month, meaning that if Squire Patton Boggs incurs a larger amount in a given month, the excess amount is carried over into the following month (unless there is an unused amount from previous months).1269 This mechanism is intended to apply until the end of the month following the issuance of the Award.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, p. 3.\n\n703.\n\nAs of 17 May 2024, of the EUR 2,182,638 for counsel fees, the excess amount represents EUR 697,638, which the Slovak Republic is settling in monthly instalments of EUR 55,000.1270\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, p. 4.\n\n704.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its costs are reasonable considering the complexity of the case, that Discovery's claims were \"exaggerated, spurious, and presented a one-sided story\",1271 and that the Claimant should not be considered as the prevailing Party unless it succeeds in a majority of the 14 disputed measures, as well as on causation and damages.1272 Even if the Slovak Republic were to succumb in this arbitration, it should still be awarded a substantial portion of its costs because Discovery increased time and costs during the arbitration.1273\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, pp. 1 and 4.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, p. 3.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, 17 May 2024, p. 3.\n\n705.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent objects to the Claimant's request for reimbursement of the deferred and contingent premiums under the ATE insurance,1274 the upfront premium of USD 200,000,1275 and the claim for 24LF's return on investment.1276\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, 27 May 2024, pp. 2-3.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, 27 May 2024, pp. 2-3.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, 27 May 2024, pp. 2 and 3.\n\n**B. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n706.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides the Tribunal with the power to set the Parties' costs and determine their allocation:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\".\n\n707.\n\nOne distinguishes broadly three approaches in the practice of ICSID tribunals on cost allocation. Some tribunals follow the principle \"costs follow the event\", which implies that the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings, including those of the prevailing party. Other tribunals leave costs lie where they fall, i.e. the parties share the arbitration costs equally and each party bears its own costs. Still others mix the two first approaches, taking various circumstances into account, including the success of the claims, legitimacy of litigating them, genuineness of the issues raised, conduct of the Parties in the arbitration and other parameters.\n\n708.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal deems it fair and appropriate to follow the third approach just outlined, but to weigh it heavily on the question of success. The Respondent clearly prevailed. While the Claimant succeeded on jurisdiction, the Slovak Republic won on all the substantive claims. It is true that some of the latter's conduct was questionable; however, the Tribunal held that it did not rise to the level of a treaty breach. The Tribunal was also struck by the Claimant's lack of serious due diligence and its various mistaken legal assumptions. As to the Parties' conduct in the arbitration, both proceeded in a professional and cooperative manner. Weighing all these different elements, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it is fair that, in addition to its own costs, the Claimant bear 100% of the ICSID costs and 75% of the Respondent's costs and expenses.\n\n709.\n\nThe Respondent's legal fees and costs amount to EUR 3,228,596.54, including counsel fees of EUR 2,182,638. According to the Respondent's latest cost submissions, pursuant to its representation agreement with counsel, the Slovak Republic will only cover the amount of EUR 2,035,000.00 if the Award is issued in January 2025. It follows that the Slovak Republic incurred total costs in the amount of EUR 3,080,958.54. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent EUR 2,310,718.90 to cover 75% of its legal and other costs.\n\n710.\n\nSubject to additional costs related to the redaction process of the Award, the costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount so far to:1277\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' Fees and Expenses | (in USD) |\n|  | Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler | 233,116.12 |\n|  | Stephen Drymer | 148,546.33 |\n|  | Philippe Sands KC | 77,750.00 |\n| Tribunal Assistant's Fees and Expenses | 120,755.51 |\n| ICSID's Administrative Fees | 188,000 |\n| Direct Expenses1278 | 146,328.66 |\n| **Total** | **914,496.62** |\n\nThe arbitration costs have been met by the Parties' advance payments of USD 480,000 each. In the Tribunal's view, the costs of the arbitration comprise the costs incurred after the commencement of the case as per ICSID's financial statement and therefore exclude the fee for lodging the request for arbitration.\n\nDirect expenses include meeting-related expenses, venue, catering and audiovisual services, interpretation, court reporting and translation, Secretary travel expenses and attendance fee as per ICSID's Financial Statement.\n\n711.\n\nAfter the finalization of the redaction process, the ICSID Secretariat will send to the Parties the final account statement containing the total amount of arbitration costs and reimburse any remainder to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n712.\n\nBoth Parties request interest on costs at a reasonable commercial rate from the date of the final award until the date of payment. The Claimant proposes USD LIBOR plus 4%, compounded annually, whereas the Respondent suggests simple interest equivalent to the yield on Slovak government 10-year bonds. Since both Parties seek interest on costs, the Tribunal awards such interest. As to the rate, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to award the Respondent simple interest equivalent to the yield of 2-year Slovak government bonds from the date of the Award until payment.\n\n**IX. OPERATIVE PART**\n----------------------\n\n713.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) DECLARES that it has jurisdiction over the dispute;\n\n(ii) DECLARES that the Respondent has not breached the US-Slovakia BIT;\n\n(iii) DISMISSES the claims on the merits;\n\n(iv) ORDERS the Claimant to pay to the Respondent one half of the total arbitration costs as reflected in ICSID's final account statement;\n\n(v) ORDERS the Claimant to pay to the Respondent EUR 2,310,718.90 for its legal fees and other costs incurred in connection with this arbitration;\n\n(vi) ORDERS the Claimant to pay simple interest on the sums awarded in (iv) and (v) above, at the rate equivalent to the yield of 2-year Slovak government bonds, from the date of the Award until payment;\n\n(vii) ORDERS either Party to notify the Tribunal within 30 days from the date of dispatch of the Award if it seeks protection for confidential information, after which the other Party may raise reasoned objections within 30 days; the Parties shall then seek to resolve any objections within 15 days; and\n\n(viii) DISMISSES all other claims and requests.\n\nDate: 15 January 2025"}]}
