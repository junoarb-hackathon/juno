INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this matter is Balkan Energy Limited (Ghana) (\"BEC\" or \"Claimant\"), a limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of Ghana, with its registered office in Accra, Ghana. BEC\u2019s sole shareholder is Balkan Energy Limited, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom (\"Balkan UK\"), which in turn is wholly owned by Balkan Energy LLC, a company incorporated in Texas, United States (\"Balkan US\"). The Claimant is represented by Mr. Gerard J. Meijer, NautaDutilh N.V., P.O. Box 1110, 3000 BC Rotterdam, and Weena 750, 3014 DA Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Mr. Kojo Bentsi-Enchill and Mr. Ace Anan Ankomah, Bentsi-Enchill, Letsa & Ankomah, 4 Barnes Close, Education Loop (off Barnes Road), PO Box GP1632, Accra, Ghana.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Ghana (hereinafter \"Respondent\" or \"Ghana\"), represented by The Honourable Mrs. Betty Mould-Iddrisu, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Attorney-General\u2019s Department, Post Office Box MB 60, Accra, Ghana; Mr. Joseph Tato, Mr. Jonathan D. Siegfried, and Mr. Jeffrey J. Amato, Dewey and LeBoeuf LLP, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019-5389 USA; Mr. Fui S. Tsikata and Ms. Marian Ekua Hayfron-Benjamin, Reindorf Chambers, Legal Practitioners, 20 Jones Nelson Road, Adabraka, Accra, Ghana; and Ms. Jacomijn J. van Haersolte-van Hof, HaersolteHof B.V., Tobias Asserlaan 5, 2517 KC The Hague, The Netherlands.\n\n**B. Background of the dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe present dispute concerns a Power Purchase Agreement (\"PPA\") entered into by the Parties on 27 July 2007, with an effective date of 31 October 2007.1 Faced with a severe power shortage, in 2007, Ghana entered into negotiations with Balkan US for the refurbishment and commissioning of the one hundred and twenty-five megawatt (125MW) dual fired (diesel and gas) Osagyefo Power Barge (\"Barge\") and associated facilities (\"Power Station\") in Effasu in Ghana\u2019s western region, which was then unused.2 Under the PPA, BEC was to commission the Barge within 90 working days of the effective date of the PPA; convert it into a combined cycle power plant by the addition of certain facilities; upgrade the capacity of the Barge; and invest in infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the Barge.3 For its part, Ghana was to ensure that all electricity necessary for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Barge was provided; facilitate the acquisition of government approvals, visas, and equipment; construct and install the transmission line required for connection to the national grid; and take and pay for all electricity thereafter generated by the Power Station.4\n\nPower Purchase Agreement Between the Government of Ghana, Acting by and through its Minister for Energy and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited on Osagyefo Power Barge and Associated Facilities Effasu Project July 2007 (\"PPA\"), (In the Matter of an Arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited v. The Republic of Ghana, acting as the Government of Ghana and, more in particular, through its Ministry of Energy, Notice of Arbitration, 23 December 2009 (\"Notice of Arbitration\"), Exhibit C-1).\n\nPPA, Preamble; Notice of Arbitration, paras. 24-25; Respondent\u2019s Brief Regarding Procedural Order No. 1, 14 September 2010 (\"Respondent\u2019s Brief\u2019), at 3.\n\nPPA, Preamble, at 1; PPA, paras. 2.1-2.4; PPA, First Schedule.\n\nPPA paras. 2.5-2.10, 3.3.\n\n4.\n\nEach Party alleges that the other has failed to perform its obligations under the PPA. For its part, BEC contends that Ghana has failed to provide adequate site electricity;5 failed to provide a connection to the national grid through a proper transmission line;6 and failed to comply with its obligation to facilitate the importation of equipment and the acquisition of all necessary permits, approvals, and visas.7 BEC further contends that, under Article 11.9 of the PPA, it is owed tolling fees since 28 October 2008, the date on which it alleges that the Power Station would have been completed but for Ghana\u2019s failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection facilities.8 The tolling fees are meant not only to cover the cost of electricity but also remunerate BEC for its investments. BEC states that it has since 25 November 2008 sent to Ghana invoices totalling over USD 50,000,000 in respect of tolling fees.9\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 45-48.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 49-57.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 58-60.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 61-69.\n\nPPA, paras. 65, 79.3; Notice of Arbitration, Exhibits 23 (invoice of 25 November 2008), 24 (twelve monthly invoices, from 25 November 2008).\n\n5.\n\nFor its part, Ghana contends that it has fulfilled its obligations and claims that the Power Station has never been operational because of breaches of the agreement by BEC.10 By letter dated 28 August 2009, Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Energy stated that Ghana had provided BEC with grid connectivity via the transmission line and interconnection facilities, and asserted that the fact that the Power Station was not operational was due to BEC\u2019s own inability to complete the facilities.11 Ghana also claims that the upgrading of certain necessary equipment was not undertaken by BEC. Moreover, Ghana asserts that recent efforts by it to inspect the Barge and to test whether it is operational \"have been repeatedly rebuffed and refused by [BEC]\".12 Relying on statements made by BEC in a lawsuit filed in a United States District Court against a subcontractor on the Barge, Ghana asserts that BEC\u2019s claim that the Barge is operational is fraudulent.13 Ghana also disputes the BEC invoices referred to above.14\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent\u2019s Brief, at 4-5.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 4-5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 4-5.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 25.\n\n6.\n\nAfter unsuccessful attempts to resolve their differences, the Parties explored the alternative of dispute resolution through arbitration. By letter dated 28 August 2009, Ghana stated that the dispute regarding the invoices \"must be resolved by arbitration before any payments can be made to BEC\" by Ghana.15 By letter dated 1 September 2009, Ghana stated that, in light of the Parties\u2019 differences, \"we have come to the conclusion that there is a dispute between the parties which cannot be settled through direct discussions... \". Ghana therefore \"invoke[d] clause 22.2 of the PPA\" and \"recommend[ed] that the issue be referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration for resolution\".16\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 3\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 4. Ghana invoked the PPA a third time in two nearly identical facsimile letters, dated 8 and 10 February 2010. Ghana\u2019s Attorney General and Minister of Justice referred to BEC\u2019s letter of 2 February 2010, and stated that \"[i]t is evident that we differ with regard to our respective interpretations of article 11.7 of the Power Purchase Agreement;\" and \"[t]he government of Ghana has more than complied with the terms of that provision. Thus, \"[w]e have no intention of facilitating your client\u2019s execution of its expressed determination to draw down on letters of credit when it has not delivered on its commitments and is not entitled to draw down under the terms and conditions of the Power Purchase Agreement\". Claimant\u2019s Answers to Questions Submitted to the Parties by the Arbitral Tribunal, 14 September 2010 (\"Claimant\u2019s Answers\"), Exhibits C-37, C-38.\n\n7.\n\nHowever, this course of action was ultimately not pursued by the Respondent. Rather it was the Claimant that on 23 December 2009 filed a Notice of Arbitration. In the arbitration BEC sought a declaration that Ghana had breached the PPA; an order that Ghana pay tolling fees of not less than USD 50,000,000 as well as damages for breaches of the PPA; and an order that Ghana fulfil its obligations under the PPA within six months from the date of the award.17\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 79.\n\n8.\n\nOn 25 June 2010, after the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal and four days before the First Procedural Meeting between the Parties was scheduled to take place on 29 June 2010, Ghana applied for and was granted an interlocutory injunction against the arbitral proceedings by the High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) in Accra, Ghana (\"Ghana High Court\"). The injunction (\"Ghana High Court Order\") restrained BEC from, *inter alia,* taking any further steps in the arbitration proceedings pending final determination of the suit before the Ghana High Court. Ghana alleged, in its suit before the High Court, that the PPA and the arbitration clause, which is part of the PPA, are void for lack of prior Parliamentary approval.18 On 6 September 2010, the Ghana High Court issued a ruling (\"Ghana High Court Ruling\") confirming the Order and dismissing the Claimant\u2019s application for a stay of proceedings.19 The facts concerning actions before Ghanaian courts will be examined further below.\n\nOrder for Interlocutory Injunction, 25 June 2010, High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) (\"Ghana High Court Order\") (Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-27).\n\nRuling, 6 September 2010, High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) (\"Ghana High Court Ruling\") (Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-41).\n\n9.\n\nThe issue at present before the Tribunal relates only to its jurisdiction in this case. The Respondent contends that both the PPA and the arbitration clause are void because the PPA did not receive Parliamentary approval as required by the Constitution of Ghana. The Claimant maintains that both questions are properly before this Tribunal. These jurisdictional questions will be examined and decided in this Interim Award.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n10.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the PPA and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the \"UNCITRAL Rules\"), BEC commenced arbitration against Ghana.20 In accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, BEC proposed that the dispute be decided by three arbitrators.21 BEC noted that the PPA stipulated that the place of arbitration would be The Hague, and that the arbitration would take place under the auspices of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\"); that the arbitration would be governed by and conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules; and that the PPA would be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Ghana. Noting that the PPA did not expressly state the language in which the arbitral proceedings were to be conducted, BEC requested, in accordance with Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Rules, that the language of the arbitration be English, following the language of the PPA and all communications between the Parties.22\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 1, 14; PPA, para. 22.2.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 21-23.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 20.\n\n11.\n\nGhana responded by facsimile dated 7 January 2010. On behalf of Ghana\u2019s Minister of Justice and Attorney-General, Mrs. Betty Mould-Iddrisu, Ghana\u2019s Solicitor-General, Mrs. Amma A. Gaisie, informed BEC that Ghana agreed to the number of arbitrators being three, with each Party nominating one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators together appointing the third. Ghana also agreed that, pursuant to Article 22.2 of the PPA, the arbitration would take place at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, and would be governed by and conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules. Finally, Ghana agreed that the language of the arbitration would be English, and notified BEC that it would be represented in the arbitration by the Minister of justice, the Honourable Mrs. Betty Mould Iddrisu.23\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-35.\n\n12.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebel as the first arbitrator.24 By letter dated 17 February 2010, Ghana stated that it had no record of receiving a Notification of Appointment from BEC; that it would deem BEC\u2019s letter of 16 February 2010 to be such Notification; and that it would appoint an arbitrator by 16 March 2010.25 By letter dated 23 February 2010, BEC agreed that it would not seek any action from the appointing authority until 16 March 2010.26 On 12 March 2010, the Respondent appointed Judge Thomas A. Mensah as the second arbitrator.27\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-36.\n\nLetter from the Respondent of 17 February 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\nLetter from the Claimant of 23 February 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-39.\n\n13.\n\nOn 1 April 2010, the Co-arbitrators notified the Parties that they had chosen Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a as the President of the Tribunal.28\n\nTerms of Appointment, 2 July 2010 (\"Terms of Appointment\"), para. 3.3.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 28 April 2010, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties\u2019 agreement that the First Procedural Meeting would take place on 29 June 2010 in Paris, France.29\n\nLetter from the Tribunal of 28 April 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal was informed in June 2010 that, on 22 February 2010, BEC had applied to the District Court of Amsterdam for leave to attach certain assets of the Government of Ghana in the Netherlands. On 24 February 2010, the District Court had granted leave to attach assets up to USD 66,330,000, pending the determination of the arbitration. However, no attachments were successfully placed, because the Government of Ghana had no assets in the relevant bank accounts.30 As will be explained below, the Claimant later gave an undertaking before the Ghana High Court that it would seek no further conservatory attachments of the Respondent\u2019s assets in any jurisdiction pending the final determination of the arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 208-220; Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-44.\n\n16.\n\nOn 25 June 2010 the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, on that same day, the Ghana High Court had issued an interlocutory injunction restraining BEC from proceeding with the arbitration; taking further steps to attach assets of the Government of Ghana; or instituting or pursuing any other arbitration proceedings or seeking any other relief in any jurisdiction outside Ghana in relation to the dispute.31 Both Parties submitted their views on the effect of the Ghana High Court Order on the present proceedings. The Tribunal, having considered both Parties\u2019 views, decided to postpone the First Procedural Meeting \"until both the relevant facts and the Parties\u2019 positions have been more fully clarified\".32\n\nLetter from the Respondent of 25 June 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\nLetter from the Tribunal of 26 June 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n17.\n\nOn 2 July 2010, the Tribunal adopted the Terms of Appointment, which reflected points of agreement communicated by the Parties in a joint letter of 8 June 2010 and telephone communications of 11 June 2010. The Terms of Appointment confirmed the UNCITRAL Rules as the governing rules and the laws of the Republic of Ghana as the governing law, and designated English as the language of arbitration and The Hague, the Netherlands, as the place of arbitration. The Parties also agreed that, notwithstanding this latter designation, the Tribunal will conduct hearings or meetings in London, England, unless the Tribunal, after having consulted with the Parties, finds it appropriate that a specific hearing or meeting be held in another location. The Parties also agreed that the Tribunal may conduct hearings or meetings by telephone. Finally, the Terms of Appointment recorded the terms of Tribunal remuneration and PCA Registry support.33\n\nTerms of Appointment.\n\n18.\n\nOn 2 July 2010, the Tribunal also adopted Procedural Order No. 1, communicating the Tribunal\u2019s decision to address questions regarding the validity of the arbitration clause contained in Article 22.2 of the PPA as a preliminary matter. The Tribunal requested the Parties to submit simultaneously, by 2 August 2010, written briefs addressing the following questions: (a) whether the Tribunal is competent to rule on the validity of the PPA and of the arbitration clause contained in Article 22 thereof; (b) whether the PPA is valid; (c) whether the Parties are bound by an agreement to arbitrate in respect of the proceedings initiated by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009; and (d) whether the Injunction issued by the Court of Justice (Commercial Division) in Accra on 25 June 2010, or any other court order of a similar nature that may be issued in the future, affects the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Both Parties were invited to submit reply briefs to address the arguments of the opposing Party within 20 days from receipt of the briefs referred to above.34\n\nProcedural Order No. 1 of 2 July 2010 (\"Procedural Order No. 1\").\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 13 July 2010, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that, pursuant to the Ghana High Court Order, the Respondent considered that the Parties would be unable to make any submissions to the Tribunal regarding Procedural Order No. 1 or Draft Procedural Order No. 2, at least until after the hearing scheduled for 20 July 2010 in Ghana or such time as the Ghana High Court issued a further ruling. The Respondent observed that for either Party to make submissions to the Tribunal would subject the offending Party to contempt.35\n\nLetter from Reindorf Chambers of 13 July 2010 (Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-43).\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 23 July 2010, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that the hearing before the Ghana High Court did not proceed as planned, but had been rescheduled for 27 July 2010. The Claimant requested an extension of the deadline for submission of the written briefs set out in Procedural Order No. 1 until 14 August 2010.36\n\nLetter from the Claimant of 23 July 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the Tribunal amended Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1 to extend the due date for filing of briefs on the matters set out in that Section until 14 August 2010; notified the Parties that it intended to hold the oral hearing on the same matters on 15 October 2010 in London, England; and requested the Parties to keep the Tribunal informed about relevant developments in connection with any hearings before or decisions adopted by the Ghana High Court.37\n\nLetter from the Tribunal of 27 July 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n22.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, taking into account the Parties\u2019 comments, the Tribunal also adopted Procedural Order No. 2, providing additional direction on procedural matters such as quorum and decisions; forms of decisions, notifications and motions; evidence; document production; and records of hearings.38\n\nProcedural Order No. 2 of 27 July 2010 (\"Procedural Order No. 2\").\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 July 2010, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that, as a result of recent filings by both Parties, the Ghana High Court adjourned the hearing of Ghana\u2019s motion to stay the arbitration and BEC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration to 11 and 12 August 2010.39 In view of this adjournment, on 17 August 2010, the Tribunal extended the due date for the filing of briefs to 14 September 2010, and the due date for reply briefs to 4 October 2010.40\n\nLetter from the Respondent of 30 July 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\nLetter from the Tribunal of 17 August 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n24.\n\nOn 7 September 2010, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that, on the previous day, the Ghana High Court had dismissed BEC\u2019s motion to stay the court proceedings in Ghana and to compel arbitration, but had granted Ghana\u2019s request to confirm the interlocutory injunction, pending the determination of the court proceedings in Ghana.41\n\nLetter from the Respondent of 7 September 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n25.\n\nOn 8 September 2010, the Tribunal confirmed the due date of 14 September 2010 for filing of the briefs on the matters set out in Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1, and the due date for reply briefs of 4 October 2010. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to address in their briefs the implications of the Ghana High Court Ruling of 6 September. Finally, the Tribunal confirmed the date of 15 October 2010 for the oral hearing on the matters set out in Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1, to be held in London, England.42\n\nLetter from the Tribunal of 8 September 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n26.\n\nOn 14 September 2010, both Parties submitted to the Tribunal briefs on the matters set out in Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n27.\n\nOn 4 October 2010, both Parties submitted to the Tribunal reply briefs regarding the matters addressed in the briefs of 14 September 2010.\n\n28.\n\nThe hearing was held on 15 October 2010 in London, England. Counsel for both Parties addressed the Tribunal on their respective views regarding the matters set out in Section 1 of Procedural Order No. 1. The Tribunal also put questions to the Parties at the hearing which were further explained in writing on 21 October 2010. The Parties submitted their respective answers to these questions on 5 November 2010.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal held deliberations in person and by correspondence following the hearing and has come to the conclusions set forth in this Interim Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n**III. STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n---------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe following section sets out what appear to be the undisputed facts regarding the arbitration proceedings and the proceedings in the Ghanaian courts. This statement of facts does not in any way indicate the position of the Tribunal with regard to the merits of the dispute, as has been noted above.\n\n**A. Conclusion of the Power Purchase Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn 2007, the Republic of Ghana faced a severe power shortage.43 As a step toward addressing this crisis, the Government of Ghana engaged in negotiations with Balkan US in order to conclude an agreement for Balkan to refurbish and recommission the 125-megawatt Osagyefo Barge in Effasu in the Western Region of Ghana.44\n\nPPA, Preamble.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 24-26; Respondent\u2019s Brief, at 3. The Parties appear to dispute the status and condition of the Barge at the time of their negotiations. The Claimant states, \"At the time of the conclusion of the PPA, the Osagyefo Power Barge had already been in Ghana since 2002 without ever having been used. This means the Power Station had never run and was in a state of neglect\". Notice of Arbitration, para. 24. By contrast, the Respondent states that the Barge, \"over time from non-use, was in need of repair\". Respondent\u2019s Brief, at 3.\n\n32.\n\nIn furtherance of these negotiations, Balkan US sent an Expression of Interest, dated 10 May 2007, promising a complete technical proposal for the commissioning of the Barge.45 Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Energy responded by inviting Balkan US to see the Barge to assist with the preparation of the proposal.46 A Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\"), dated 16 May 2007, was signed by Ghana\u2019s Minister of Energy, the Honourable Joseph K. Adda, and by Mr. Phillip Elders, Senior Vice President for Balkan US. The MOU called for a Power Purchase Agreement to stipulate the final terms and conditions of the agreement between the two Parties.47 The PPA was subsequently negotiated by the Parties with the participation of government and corporate officials.48\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 5.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 6.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-29.\n\n33.\n\nArticle 12 of the Ghana Energy Commission Act of 1997 (Act 541) requires that, for a company to hold a license for bulk energy supply in Ghana, it must be incorporated in Ghana.49 To meet this requirement, BEC was, with the agreement of Ghana, registered under the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) of Ghana as a locally incorporated company on 16 July 2007. The ownership structure of BEC has been explained in paragraph 1 above.50\n\nGhana Energy Commission Act of 1997 (Act 541), Art. 12 (Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-30).\n\nCertificate of Incorporation, Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited (Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-31).\n\n34.\n\nThe PPA was signed by representatives of both Parties on 27 July 2007.51\n\nPPA.\n\n35.\n\nIn Article 29.2 of the PPA, Ghana warranted that:\n\n[The Government of Ghana] has the full power, authority, and legal right to carry on its business as now conducted. The [Government of Ghana] has taken all actions necessary or reasonably requested by BEC to authorize it to execute, deliver, perform and observe the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other documents. The [Respondent] has the full legal right, power and authority for and on behalf of the Government of Ghana to pledge the full faith and credit of the Republic of Ghana under the terms of the Agreement.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe [Government of Ghana] has duly executed and delivered this Agreement on or before the Agreement date.... This Agreement has been executed and delivered and constitutes, and will constitute, a direct, general, and unconditional legal obligation of the [Government of Ghana] which is legal, valid, and binding upon the [Government of Ghana] and enforceable against the [Government of Ghana] in accordance with its respective terms, and for which the full faith and credit of the Republic of Ghana is pledged.52\n\nPPA, para. 29.2(a), (d).\n\n36.\n\nAdditionally, Article 7.2 of the PPA conditioned the effectiveness of the PPA on issuance, within 14 days of its execution, of a letter from the Government of Ghana that all required approvals from the relevant authorities in Ghana had been obtained, as well as a legal opinion of the Attorney-General of Ghana as to the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of the agreement.53 Specifically, the legal opinion was to address Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana, which requires Parliamentary approval for any \"international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party\".54\n\nPPA, para. 7.2.\n\nConstitution of Ghana, Art. 181(5) (Respondent\u2019s Compendium of Authorities, Exhibit 26).\n\n37.\n\nOn 26 October 2007, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Ghana, the Honourable Joe Ghartey, issued two legal opinions. The first opinion stated:\n\nAfter examining the attached documents we are satisfied that...\n\n... the power producer, Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited (BEC) is a locally incorporated company and as a result the PPA does not come under the ambit of Article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution which stipulates that an international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party should be submitted to Parliament for approval. In the Supreme Court case of Attorney General versus Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd. (2005-2006)... the Supreme Court held that international business or economic transaction means international business or international economic transaction. This clearly excludes the project hereof which involves a local company in a local transaction with the Government.\n\nIn light of the above a Parliamentary approval would not be required for the effectiveness of the Agreement[].55\n\nThe second legal opinion stated:\n\nI have examined executed copies of the [PPA and project Site Lease (\"Project Agreements\")] and such other documents as I have considered necessary or desirable to examine in order that 1 may give this opinion....\n\nI am of the opinion that:\n\n(i) [The Government of Ghana] has the power to enter into the Project Agreements and to exercise its rights and perform its obligations there under, and execution of the Project Agreements on behalf of [the Government of Ghana] by the person(s) who executed the Project Agreements was duly authorised;\n\n(ii) all acts, conditions and things required by the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana to be done, fulfilled and performed in order (a) to enable [the Government of Ghana] lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights under and perform the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in the Project Agreements, (b) to ensure that the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in the Project Agreements are valid and enforceable by appropriate proceedings and (c) to make the Project Agreements admissible in evidence in the Republic of Ghana, have been done, fulfilled and performed in compliance with the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana;\n\n(iii) The obligations of [the Government of Ghana] under the Project Agreements are legal and valid obligations binding on [the Government of Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreements;\n\n(iv) [The Government of Ghana] is not entitled under the terms of the Project Agreements to claim any immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process in the Republic of Ghana and such waiver is legal and binding on [the Government of Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreements; and\n\n(v) The sanctity of contract is recognised under the laws of Ghana and consequently the validity of the Project Agreements and the binding nature of the obligations of the parties there under are constitutionally safeguarded.56\n\nOperationalising the Osagyefo Barge, Legal Opinion by the Attorney-General, 26 October 2007 (Notice of Arbitration, Exhibit 8).\n\nLegal Opinion, Power Purchase Agreement Between the Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited, 26 October 2007 (Notice of Arbitration, Exhibit 8).\n\n38.\n\nOn 30 October 2007, the Minister for Energy of Ghana, Mr. Adda, noted in a communication to Mr. Elders that, as per the conditions precedent in Article 7 of the PPA, Ghana had: issued a legal opinion as to the validity, enforceability and binding effect of the PPA; issued to BEC a standby letter of credit, as required by Article 11.7; and provided BEC with construction power at the Effasu site. Mr. Adda also acknowledged that BEC had submitted to Ghana: copies of BEC\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, Certificate to Commence Business, and Regulations of BEC; copies of resolutions adopted by BEC\u2019s Board of Directors authorizing the execution, delivery and performance by BEC of the PPA; and copies of a resolution adopted by BEC shareholders authorizing the execution, delivery and performance by BEC of the PPA, certified by the BEC Secretary. In the communication, Mr. Adda declared 31 October 2007 to be the PPA Effective Date.57\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-32.\n\n39.\n\nUnder the PPA, the Parties agreed that, whereas Ghana had an urgent need for additional electricity generation to meet its power supply deficiencies, BEC, bearing all costs, estimated at USD 40 million, would lease the Power Station from Ghana, and would commission it within 90 working days of the effective date of the PPA; that BEC, bearing all costs, estimated at USD 100 million, would convert the Power Station into a combined cycle power plant by the addition of a heat recovery steam generator with an incremental capacity of approximately 60MW, a steam turbine, and electric generator and associated facilities within nine months of the effective date of the PPA; that BEC, at an estimated cost of USD 250 to 300 million, would privately invest and bring two more combined cycle barge mounted systems, with capacity of approximately 185 megawatts each, to the site within thirty-six months of agreement on a tolling fee for the systems; that BEC would, subject to satisfactory conclusion of supply agreements with other source providers and at an estimated cost of USD 100 million, invest in infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the Power Station within three years of the effective date of the PPA; and that BEC would provide all fuel to the Project at cost.58\n\nPPA, Preamble; paras 2.1-2.4; First Schedule.\n\n40.\n\nUnder the PPA, the Parties also agreed that Ghana would ensure that all necessary electricity was provided, at BEC\u2019s cost, and made available at the site as reasonably required by BEC; that Ghana would promptly facilitate the acquisition of governmental approvals for the duty-free importation and transportation of equipment to the site, for operating permits, licenses and approvals for the project, and for visas and work permits for foreign personnel and for full compliance with all local and other regulations; that Ghana thereby guaranteed that BEC would have the exclusive right to generate electricity from the site subject to meeting the agreed timetable; that Ghana would facilitate the acquisition of all governmental approvals required for the leasing, equipping and operation of the Power Station, including relevant environmental permits from the Environmental Protection Agency; that Ghana would construct, install and connect the transmission line and relay protection equipment necessary to connect the Power Station to the national grid, except that BEC would be responsible, at its own cost, for provision of adequate transmission cables to the point of interconnection with Ghana\u2019s national electricity grid; that Ghana would take and pay for all electricity generated by the Power Station during the term of the Agreement.59\n\nPPA, paras. 2.5-2.9, 3.3.\n\n41.\n\nUnder the PPA, the Parties also agreed that they would mutually collaborate with each other in order to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance by each Party of its obligations, and that Ghana would provide full and timely cooperation in connection with BEC\u2019s efforts to finance the Power Station on a non-recourse, project finance basis, including, without limitation, responding to all requests for information on and certification of Ghana\u2019s authority and the status of the PPA.60\n\nPPA, para. 2.10.\n\n42.\n\nThe PPA further provides that, should BEC be unable to commence testing of the Power Station as a result of Ghana\u2019s failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection facilities for the Power Station, Ghana would be obligated to commence paying tolling fees to BEC on the thirtieth day after BEC certified to Ghana that the Power Station was complete or would have been complete except for Ghana\u2019s non-performance.61\n\nPPA, para. 11.9.\n\n43.\n\nFinally, Article 22.2 of the PPA provides, in relevant part:\n\nIf any disputes arise out of or in relation to this Agreement and if such matter cannot be settled through direct discussion of the Parties, the matter shall be referred to binding arbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Peace Palace, Carnegieplein 2, 2517 KJ in The Hague, The Netherlands.... Applications may be made to such court for judicial recognition of the award and/or an enforcement as the case may be. Arbitration shall be governed by and conducted in accordance with UNCITRAL rules.\n\nB. Initiation of proceedings in Ghana\n-------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nAs noted above, by Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009, BEC initiated arbitral proceedings against Ghana on the basis of Article 22.2 of the PPA.62 The Tribunal was duly constituted on 1 April 2010.63\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 14-15.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-36, C-39; Terms of Appointment, para. 3.3.\n\n45.\n\nOn 25 June 2010, upon motion *ex parte* for interlocutory injunction by the Attorney-General of Ghana, the Ghana High Court issued an injunction, restraining BEC from proceeding with arbitration pending the determination of the enforceability, under Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana, of the arbitration clause and the PPA. BEC was additionally restrained from taking further steps in relation to the 26 February 2010 decision of the District Court of Amsterdam attaching the Government of Ghana\u2019s assets in the Netherlands pending final determination of the suit before the Ghanaian courts. Finally, BEC was restrained from instituting or pursuing any other arbitration proceedings or seeking any other relief in any jurisdiction outside the jurisdiction of Ghana in respect of the PPA, pending the final determination of the suit before the Ghanaian courts.64\n\nGhana High Court Order.\n\n46.\n\nOn 5 July 2010, on further application by the Government of Ghana, the Ghana High Court renewed the order and set 20 July 2010 for argument on the Government\u2019s motion.65\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, Exhibit 8; *see also* Letter from Reindorf Chambers of 13 July 2010.\n\n47.\n\nOn 14 July 2010, the Claimant filed a motion on notice in the Ghana High Court for an order to stay proceedings and to compel arbitration.66\n\nMotion on Notice for Stay of Proceedings, 14 July 2010, High Court of Justice (Commercial Division), not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n48.\n\nOn 15 July 2010, BEC gave a specific undertaking before the Ghana High Court that it would not seek any further conservatory attachments of any of Ghana\u2019s assets in any country, pending the final determination of the arbitration.67\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 219.\n\n49.\n\nOn 20 July 2010, the hearing before the Ghana High Court did not proceed as planned, and was rescheduled for 27 July 2010.68 However, as a result of further filings by both Parties, the Ghana High Court adjourned the hearing on Ghana\u2019s motion to stay the arbitration, and BEC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration, to 11 and 12 August 2010.69\n\nLetter from the Claimant of 23 July 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings,\n\nLetter from the Respondent of 30 July 2010, not included as Exhibit to pleadings.\n\n50.\n\nOn 6 September 2010, the Ghana High Court dismissed BEC\u2019s motion to stay the court proceedings in Ghana and to compel arbitration, and it granted Ghana\u2019s request for an interlocutory injunction pending the determination of the court proceedings in Ghana. The injunction restrains BEC from proceeding with or taking any further steps whatsoever in the arbitration proceedings instituted by it on 23 December 2009 against Ghana, save to notify the Tribunal of this restraint, pending the final determination of the suit in Ghana; restrains BEC from taking any further steps in relation to or in connection with a decision made by the District Court of Amsterdam in the Netherlands on 26 February 2010 attaching assets of Ghana in the Netherlands, pending final determination of the suit in Ghana; and that BEC, its privies and agents are restrained from instituting or pursuing any other arbitration proceedings or seeking any other relief in any jurisdiction outside Ghana in respect of the PPA, pending the final determination of the suit in Ghana.\n\n51.\n\nIn its Ruling, the Court relied on Ghanaian case law, arguments of the Deputy Attorney-General, and affidavits from officials of the Attorney-General\u2019s Office and the Ministry of Energy. The Court first found that Ghana had established that the application was neither frivolous nor vexatious because serious constitutional and legal issues had been raised.70 These constitutional and legal issues were: whether the PPA and arbitration clause were \"international business or economic transactionjs]\" and thus void for failure to obtain prior Parliamentary approval, and whether the 2005 decision of the Ghana Supreme Court in *Attorney General v. Faroe Atlantic* had determined the constitutional issue, or whether, instead, the corporate veil should be lifted on BEC.\n\nGhana High Court Ruling, at 9-11.\n\n52.\n\nFurthermore, analyzing the \"balance of conveniences,\" the Court found that Ghana had made a strong case that it would suffer greater harm, as compared to mere delay in the arbitral proceedings, if the application was not granted, including expenses incurred in defending other proceedings while the matter was pending in Ghana.71 In the Court\u2019s view, however, the dispositive issue was not so much which Party would suffer the greater harm, but whether or not the harm caused could be easily repaired. In that regard, it found that, whereas the seizure and disposition of Ghana\u2019s assets would not be easily repaired, BEC could be compensated by Ghana where necessary.72 In determining the balance of convenience, the Court also considered whether the Arbitral Tribunal possesses competence to decide the constitutional question at issue in the Ghanaian proceedings, and whether the Tribunal would be bound by any stay of execution it issued, which is provided for in Ghana\u2019s Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2010 (Act 798) (\"GADRA\"). Finally, the Court noted the fact that the UNCITRAL Rules permit the Tribunal to rule on objections at the close of the proceedings.73\n\nGhana High Court Ruling, at 11-12.\n\nGhana High Court Ruling, at 12.\n\nGhana High Court Ruling, at 14.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter dated 9 September 2010 addressed to the Claimant, Ghana\u2019s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice Mrs. Mould-Iddrisu stated Ghana\u2019s position that, in view of the decision, \"the proper steps to take in relation to the arbitration proceedings is to ask the Tribunal to suspend its proceedings pending the determination of the Ghana High Court action. Should Balkan take any steps with a view to continuing the proceedings, it will be in contempt of court and we will not hesitate to take appropriate and immediate action. To put the matter beyond doubt, we would be happy to take steps jointly with you to advise the Tribunal to suspend any further proceedings including the hearing that it has scheduled for 15lh October 2010\".74\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-28.\n\n54.\n\nAt the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the hearing took place on 15 October as envisaged, and both Parties were duly in attendance to argue their respective views on the jurisdictional issues raised. The Tribunal notes that, after the hearing, the procedure for referral of the constitutional issue to the Supreme Court was nevertheless set in motion by the Respondent\u2019s application to this effect to the Ghana High Court, and notice was served on counsel for BEC on 4 November 2010.75 The procedure for pre-trial conference was also set in motion on 5 November 2010.76\n\nRespondent\u2019s Answers to the Questions Posed by the Tribunal, 5 November 2010 (\"Respondent\u2019s Third Submission\"), at 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 4.\n\n55.\n\nOn the basis of the Parties\u2019 submissions both in writing and orally the Tribunal is now in a position to decide the jurisdictional matter disputed.\n\n**IV. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAs noted earlier, the present Interim Award relates exclusively to certain matter\u2019s that require a preliminary determination on the part of the Tribunal\u2014notably, the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in these proceedings. The Interim Award does not address the Parties\u2019 substantive claims and defences. Accordingly, the Tribunal will only restate in the following section the Parties\u2019 requests for relief to the extent that they pertain to matters covered by the present Interim Award.77\n\nAs indicated in its Notice of Arbitration, the substance of the Claim concerns BEC\u2019s purported entitlement to tolling fees \"provisionally estimated at an amount of no less than US$ 50 million\" as well as a yet-unspecified amount of compensation. The Claimant noted, further, that it intended \"to provide full particulars of the amounts claimed by way of payment of Tolling Fees and of damages, as well as a detailed statement of the declarations and orders that it shall seek from the Arbitral Tribunal to that end\" and reserved \"the right to amend or supplement its claims in its Statement of Claim,\" Notice of Arbitration, paras. 77 and 80.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent initially requested that the Tribunal \"decline to rule on a non-arbitrable matter \u2014namely, whether the Constitution of Ghana, as properly interpreted, renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable\u2014and, in any event, suspend these proceedings pending a final determination by the Ghana court on the constitutional issue before it\".78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 17.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant, in its initial brief, concluded that \"this Arbitral Tribunal is the competent and correct decision-maker on the question of its jurisdiction\" and that \"this Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to proceed with this arbitration\". In addition, the Claimant requested that the Arbitral Tribunal \"issue both a procedural order on the confidentiality of these proceedings, as well as an anti-suit injunction ordering [the Respondent] to withdraw its requests currently before the Ghanaian High Court of Justice and to refrain from initiating any further court proceedings in Ghana or anywhere else\".79\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 262, 264.\n\n59.\n\nIn its Reply Brief, the Respondent stated that the Tribunal \"should decline from ruling on a nonarbitrable matter, or suspend these proceedings pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Ghana on the applicability of Article 181(5) of the Constitution to the PPA and arbitration clause therein\". The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal \"deny the request for interim relief sought by Balkan\".80\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief Regarding Procedural Order No. 1, 4 October 2010 (\"Respondent\u2019s Reply Brief\u2019), at 32.\n\n60.\n\nIn addition to confirming its position regarding the Tribunal\u2019s competence, the Claimant restated in its Reply Submission the request that the Tribunal \"issue both a procedural order on the confidentiality of these proceedings, as well as an anti-suit injunction ordering [the Respondent] to withdraw its requests currently before the Ghanaian High Court of Justice and to refrain from initiating any further court proceedings in Ghana or anywhere else\".\n\n**V. JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES TO BE DECIDED BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 1, which was adopted in consideration of the Parties\u2019 initial views regarding the implications of the Ghana High Court Order of 25 June 2010, the Tribunal had identified the following points, which it believes to be central to the question of its jurisdiction:\n\na. The competency of the Tribunal to rule on the validity of the PPA and the arbitration clause contained in Article 22 thereof;\n\nb. The validity of the PPA, and whether the Parties are bound by an agreement to arbitrate in respect of the proceedings initiated by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009;\n\nc. Whether the Ghana High Court Order of 25 June 2010, or any other court order of a similar nature that may be issued in the future, affects the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and the implications of the 6 September 2010 Ghana High Court Ruling in relation to Ghana\u2019s application for an interlocutory injunction and BEC\u2019s motion on notice for a stay of proceedings.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine the Parties\u2019 arguments and come to its findings on each of these points. In so doing the Tribunal wishes to state at the outset that it has the highest respect for the courts of Ghana and its legal system as a whole. It does not regard the issues disputed as entailing a legal competition between its competence as an arbitration tribunal and the jurisdiction of the national courts of Ghana. Rather, it believes that its decision should be taken solely on the basis of the legal rules and principles that ought to apply, in the light of the Parties\u2019 commitments, including those specified in Article 22 of the PPA, and of the Tribunal\u2019s aim to seek the most reasonable alternative in the pursuit of justice.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal notes with appreciation that the Ghana High Court Order does not question the competence of this Tribunal, under the UNCITRAL Rules, to give its ruling on objections at the appropriate point of the proceedings, be it the jurisdictional or the merits phase, nor does it purport to subject the Tribunal to the orders (e.g., stay of execution) of the Ghana High Court. In the same spirit of courtesy and respect the Tribunal will not grant the request of the Claimant that the Tribunal issue an anti-suit injunction ordering Ghana to withdraw its domestic suit or to refrain from any further court proceedings in Ghana or elsewhere. As indicated below, the Tribunal will be pleased to take fully into account the views of the courts in Ghana, to the extent that such views become available in the course of its proceedings. For that purpose, the Tribunal will endeavour as much as possible to arrange for an ample procedural calendar so as to take account of this possibility.\n\n**A. The competency of the Tribunal to rule on the validity of the PPA and the arbitration clause contained in Article 22 thereof.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n----------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that determination of the validity of either the PPA or the arbitration clause involves determinations on questions of interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution, and is, therefore, non-arbitrable. The Respondent further maintains that, even if the Tribunal nonetheless were to find that it is competent to rule on the validity of either or both agreements, the proper and practical course would be for the Tribunal to exercise restraint and to await a definitive determination of the issues of Ghanaian Constitutional law by the Ghana Supreme Court, which is seized of those issues.\n\n65.\n\nIn respect of the Tribunal\u2019s competence to rule on the validity of the PPA, the Respondent submits that the PPA, by its terms, is expressly governed by Ghanaian law.81 The Respondent asserts that there is a threshold question of Ghanaian constitutional law as to whether the PPA is valid in the absence of Parliamentary approval. In this regard, the Respondent refers to Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, which provides that the Ghanaian Parliament must approve any \"international business or economic transaction\" to which the Government of Ghana is a party.82 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Ghana Supreme Court has not yet clearly spoken as to whether Article 181(5) applies to transactions that are between the Government of Ghana and a local entity, but which have international elements. The Respondent refers to the Ghana High Court Ruling, which found that \"serious constitutional questions\" exist as to whether the PPA is an international business or economic transaction, within the meaning of Article 181 (5).83\n\nTranscript of the Hearing Held in London on 15 October 2010 (\"Hearing Transcript\"), 6:12-23; 25:16-17; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1 (question 1).\n\nHearing Transcript, 5:5-8:4; 21:10-21; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1 (question 1). Article 121 of the Ghanaian Constitution provides, in full:\n\n(1) Parliament may, by a resolution supported by the votes of a majority of all the members of Parliament, authorise the Government to enter into an agreement for the granting of a loan out of any public fund or public account.\n\n(2) An agreement entered into under clause (1) of this article shall be laid before Parliament and shall not come into operation unless it is approved by a resolution of Parliament.\n\n(3) No loan shall be raised by the Government on behalf of itself or any other public institution or authority otherwise than by or under the authority of an Act of Parliament.\n\n(4) An act of Parliament enacted in accordance with clause (3) of this article shall provide\n\n(a) that the terms and conditions of a loan shall be laid before Parliament and shall not come into operation unless they have been approved by a resolution of Parliament; and\n\n(b) that any moneys received in respect of that loan shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund and form part of that Fund or into some other public fund of Ghana either existing or created for the purposes of the loan.\n\n(5) This article shall, with the necessary modifications by Parliament, apply to an international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party as it applies to a loan.\n\nHearing Transcript, 5:10-17; 7:11-8:4.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that Ghanaian law is clear that the Ghana Supreme Court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Ghanaian Constitution, and that questions relating to the interpretation of the Constitution of Ghana are non-arbitrable.84 In these regards, the Respondent refers to Article 130(1)(a) of the Ghanaian Constitution, which vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the Ghana Supreme Court over \"all matters relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Constitution,\"85 and to Article 1 of the GADRA, which, in the Respondent\u2019s view, expressly exempts from arbitration issues of \"enforcement and interpretation of the Constitution\".86 The Respondent argues that these two provisions, taken together, render non-arbitrable the question whether the PPA is void *ah initio* for failure of Parliamentary approval.87\n\nHearing Transcript, 8:5-18; 9:8-10:3.\n\nHearing Transcript, 8:13-18; 9:8-13; 25:17-19. Article 130(1) of the Ghanaian Constitution provides, in full:\n\n(1) Subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court in the enforcement of the Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms as provided in article 33 of this Constitution, the Supreme Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in -\n\n(a) all matters relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Constitution; and\n\n(b) all matters arising as to whether an enactment was made in excess of the powers conferred on Parliament or any other authority or person by law or under this Constitution.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 7-8. Article 1 GADRA provides, in relevant part: \"This Act applies to matters other than those that relate to... (c) the enforcement and interpretation of the Constitution;\".\n\nHearing Transcript, 88:4-19.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Ghanaian law governs the arbitration clause and thus also determines issues of objective arbitrability.88 According to the Respondent, Ghanaian law governs the arbitration clause because the Parties specifically subjected the PPA to the laws of Ghana, and the default position in international arbitration is that a choice of law provision in the main contract also applies to an arbitration clause contained therein. In the Respondent\u2019s view, there is at least a strong presumption in favour of extending the application of the law of the main contract to the arbitration clause.89 The Respondent later clarified that the invalidity of the arbitration clause is not due to the invalidity of the PPA, but is rather a consequence of the fact that the arbitration clause is also subject to the same requirements of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 11; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 7 (question 6).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 13-16; Hearing Transcript, 27:6-20; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1 (question 1), 6 (question 6).\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the conclusion that Ghanaian law governs the arbitration clause is all the more compelling in this dispute because neither the arbitration agreement nor the PPA itself specified the seat for the arbitration. Rather, the seat of the arbitration (in the Netherlands) and the place of hearing were only agreed to by the Parties\u2019 counsel in May 2010, and were not part of the PPA. It is the Respondent\u2019s position that at no point during the May 2010 discussions did counsel for either Party suggest or agree that the law of the arbitral seat would replace Ghanaian law with regard to the substantive validity of either the arbitration clause or of the PPA, or that the law of the arbitral seat would apply beyond the procedural laws of the arbitration.90\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 n. 11 (question 6).\n\n69.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent argues that, even if one accepts that no presumption exists in favour of applying the law governing the main agreement to the arbitration agreement, and the \u2018closest connection\u2019 test is applied instead, all factors in this case point to Ghanaian law. These factors include: Ghanaian law governs the main agreement; the place of performance is Ghana; both Parties to the arbitration agreement are subject to Ghana law; and the object of the agreement relates entirely to Ghana. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the only factor suggesting that Dutch law should govern the arbitration clause (and thus govern arbitrability) is the Parties\u2019 choice of the Netherlands as the seat of arbitration. However, in view of the strength of the other factors, and because the claims arise under the substantive laws and policies of Ghana, this latter choice is of lesser importance. Moreover, the Respondent suggests that, in view of the reality that any potential challenges to enforcement will arise in Ghana, it makes little sense, at this stage, to apply Dutch rather than Ghanaian law to the questions of arbitrability.91\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 16-17, 25-27; Hearing Transcript, 27:21-28:2; 94:10-96:19; 98:6-99:10; 102:25-103:8; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 (question 6).\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent disputes what it views as the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, New York, 10 June 1958, (\"New York Convention\") prescribes the application of the *lex fori* to questions of arbitrability, and particularly that the *lex fori* should govern questions of substantive arbitrability in the first place.92 However, Respondent suggest that, even if the Tribunal decides that it is appropriate to apply Dutch law, Articles 1020 and 1073 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (\"DCCP\") provide a conflict of laws approach that leads to the application of Ghanaian law, as the law to which the dispute is most closely connected.93 Moreover, even failing the application of Ghanaian law pursuant to Articles 1020 and 1073 DCCP, the Respondent argues that the Ghanaian Constitution may be considered non-arbitrable under Dutch legal provisions that provide exceptions in respect of matters of public policy and for matters for which exclusive jurisdiction is vested in a specific court.94\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 25-26; Hearing Transcript, 22:22-24:5. In the Respondent\u2019s view, Article V(2) of the New York Convention is addressed to the courts, and applies during the enforcement stage; it does not prescribe the law to be used in the arbitration proceedings.\n\nHearing Transcript, 24:6-25:5; 96:20-99:17; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 (question 6). Article 1020(3) DCCP provides: \"The arbitration agreement shall not serve to determine legal consequences of which the parties cannot freely dispose\".\n\nHearing Transcript, 26:6-15; 99:11-101:18.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent takes the position that if Ghanaian law governs arbitrability, the validity of the arbitration clause is non-arbitrable. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the instant dispute only if the arbitration clause is valid and binding.95 However, serious questions exist as to whether the arbitration agreement itself is an international business or economic transaction, within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, and thus invalid for lack of Parliamentary approval. Thus, for the Tribunal to consider the validity of the arbitration agreement with a view to determining its jurisdiction would require it to engage in interpretation of a provision of the Ghanaian constitution, a function which Ghanaian law does not permit an arbitral tribunal to perform. The Respondent refers to the Ghana High Court Ruling to this effect; to Article 130(1) of the Ghanaian Constitution; and to Article 1 of the GADRA.96 The Respondent further refers to the international law doctrine of \"nonarbitrability,\" which it argues permits States, through their national laws, to exempt matters of fundamental public policy from the purview of arbitration. The Respondent contends that a decision by the Tribunal that it has competence to answer a question relating to the constitutional law of Ghana would directly violate the New York Convention and other conventions.97 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the conclusion that the Tribunal is not competent is particularly appropriate given the fundamentally public nature of the task of constitutional interpretation. Moreover, the Respondent asserts that a pronouncement by this Tribunal that it is competent to decide the dispute between the Parties would have the \"untenable\" consequence that the review of the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution could ultimately fall to foreign courts (for example, in enforcement proceedings outside Ghana).98\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1 (question 1).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 6-8; Respondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 11; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1 (question 1).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 6-8; Respondent\u2019s Reply Brief at 23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 9.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s contentions that no \"genuine\" issue of constitutional interpretation exists with respect to Article 181(5); that the Respondent has raised the jurisdictional objection in the Ghanaian courts merely as a pretext to evade an obligation to arbitrate; and that the constitutional questions are unambiguous and clear. The Respondent refers to its submissions in the proceedings before the Ghana High Court, in which it sought a declaration that the PPA is unenforceable because it does not satisfy the requirements specified by Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution.99 The Respondent also refers to the Ghana High Court\u2019s conclusion, after extensive briefing and argument, that the application presented serious issues of constitutional interpretation.100 The Respondent suggests that the arguments now made by the Claimant to this Tribunal are the same that it previously made to, and that were rejected by, the Ghana High Court.101\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 5-6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 6-8, 22-23; Hearing Transcript, 19:1-9; 15-21; 87:9-88:3; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 n.5 (question 2).\n\nHearing Transcript, 19:21-20:21; 86:22-24; 86:25-87:8.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the Claimant\u2019s contention that any genuine issue of constitutional interpretation that exists is not currently pending before the Ghana Supreme Court. It argues that the Claimant itself created delay in the referral to the Supreme Court by failing to file its defence until 13 October 2010.102 It disputes the Claimant\u2019s estimate for the completion of the Ghanaian proceedings, including the claim that there will be a mandatory 30-day mediation at the outset.103 A delay of six to nine months has been the Respondent\u2019s best estimate as to the resolution of the issue by the Ghana Supreme Court. As has been noted above proceedings for a referral to the Ghana Supreme Court and procedures for a pre-trial conference were in fact set in motion in early November 2010.104 The Respondent maintains that the question of the constitutionality of the PPA and the arbitration clause could be avoided neither by the Respondent, nor by the Ghanaian courts.105 It further notes that the Ghana High Court has ordered the Respondent to file an undertaking to fully compensate the Claimant for any damages caused by the delay in the proceedings before the Tribunal, should the Claimant prevail in the proceedings in Ghana.106\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 6-7; Hearing Transcript, 19:1-20; 85:11-86:1 ; 93:2-16; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 n.6 (question 3), Exhibit A, at 8, para. 15.\n\nHearing Transcript, 86:2-11; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 3).\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent refers to its own application of 3 November 2010 to the Ghana High Court, pursuant to Article 130(2) of the Ghanaian Constitution, for immediate referral of the constitutional questions to the Supreme Court. Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 2-3 (question 3), Exhibit A.\n\nHearing Transcript, 14:2-18; 30:6-12.\n\nHearing Transcript, 15:22-16:9; 93:17-21.\n\n74.\n\nWith regard to the doctrines of competence-competence and separability, the Respondent maintains that although Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, Article 1052 of the DCCP, and the GADRA each provide that the Tribunal may rule on objections to its jurisdiction, none instructs that the Tribunal must do so. The Respondent further asserts that these doctrines are not absolute where the existence or validity of an agreement to arbitrate is questioned.107 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the instant case presents a unique scenario in which both the validity of the main agreement and the validity of the arbitration agreement are disputed.108\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 12-13; Hearing Transcript, 26:16-27:5; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 (question 6).\n\nHearing Transcript, 103:9-104:13.\n\n75.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent asserts that, although the separability principle provides that an arbitration clause is not invalid simply *because* the underlying contract is invalid, the law that renders the underlying contract invalid may also render the arbitration clause invalid. The Respondent stresses that the separability presumption does not necessarily mean that different bodies of law govern the arbitration clause and the underlying contract. In the Respondent\u2019s view, in the present case, both the PPA and the arbitration clause are subject to Ghanaian law, and are thus subject to the same challenge for failure to comply with Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution.109\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 5-6 (question 6).\n\n76.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent challenges the Claimant\u2019s view that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to consider and to resolve issues concerning its own jurisdiction derives from the arbitration Jaw that governs the arbitration agreement. In the Respondent\u2019s view, and as it has stated above, Ghanaian law is explicit that it is exclusively for the Ghana Supreme Court to determine whether the arbitration clause is invalid, because, in this case, this determination involves a matter of constitutional interpretation.110\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 6-7 (question 6).\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, even apart from the Ghana Supreme Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, as a matter of efficiency, fairness, and institutional competence, the challenge to the validity of the arbitration agreement in this case should be decided, in the first instance, by the Ghana Supreme Court. It recognizes that the approach adopted by legal systems differ on the issue of allocation of competence over jurisdictional objections, and is even prepared to accept that the \"better approach\" may well be that questions regarding the *scope* of the arbitration agreement should be decided in the first instance by the Arbitral Tribunal. However, it argued that, where there is a credible dispute as to the *existence, validity,* or *legality* of an arbitration agreement, the issues should be decided by the national courts, following full consideration.111 The Respondent asserts, moreover, that the Ghanaian courts were first seized of the jurisdictional question arising from Article 181(5) of the Constitution, even though the Notice of Arbitration was introduced earlier, and it argues that the Ghanaian courts should be accorded priority to resolve that question.112 The Respondent acknowledges, however, that the order of seizure is only a \"supplementary consideration\".113\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1-2 (question 2), 7-8 (question 6).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 1 (question 2).\n\nHearing Transcript, 91:14-92:22; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 n.3 (question 2).\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that, even if the Tribunal decides that it may rule on the validity of the arbitration clause, and further decides that the arbitration clause is valid, the Tribunal is still faced with the question whether the PPA is valid under the Ghanaian Constitution.114 The Respondent therefore suggests that the wise and proper course for the Tribunal to follow, as a matter of international comity, li *s pendens arbitralis,* practicality, and enforceability, would be to exercise its discretion to await a definitive interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution by the Ghana Supreme Court, as the body with greater expertise and the body that is already seized of the issue.115 In this regard, the Respondent adds that the question whether the Tribunal or the Ghanaian courts were seized first is not determinative under the applicable substantive law (although the Tribunal is of course free to consider that question in deciding how to exercise its discretion).116 The Tribunal should accordingly suspend its proceedings pending such interpretation.117\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 13; Hearing Transcript, 5:19-8:4; 18:3-11; 21:10-22:8; 26:7-12; 31:23-32:9.\n\nHearing Transcript, 10:4-15:21 ; 20:15-21; 22:9-14; 25:16-26:5; 30:13-25; 32:9-24; 92:18-93:1, 104:1419.\n\nHearing Transcript, 91 ; 14-92:22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 27.\n\n79.\n\nAs to enforceability, the Respondent asserts that, although the New York Convention may permit conflicting decisions on enforcement in different jurisdictions, it is nonetheless a fundamental principle of international arbitration that a tribunal should attempt to render an enforceable award.118 The Respondent suggests that any issue regarding the enforcement of a potential award would arise in Ghana. It further contends that because, under the New York Convention, the Ghanaian courts will look to their own laws to determine whether the interpretation of the Constitution was arbitrable, the Tribunal should, at this time, give deference to the Ghanaian courts regarding arbitrability, and should allow the Ghana Supreme Court an opportunity to rule on the applicability of Article 181 (5) to the arbitration clause.119\n\nHearing Transcript, 13:1-14:1; 14:19-15:14; *see also* Hearing Transcript, 88:20-89:18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 26-27.\n\n80.\n\nAs regards questions of estoppel, the Respondent argues that the Attorney-General\u2019s statement to the Claimant, on 1 September 2009, that she was recommending that the issues then in dispute be referred to arbitration, does not in any way affect the arbitrability of the present dispute. The Respondent suggests that the Attorney-General\u2019s statement was precipitated by the Claimant\u2019s threats to unilaterally draw down on a letter of credit. The Respondent asserts that, upon further review of the constitutional issues involved, both the Attorney-General and the Solicitor General concluded that the PPA and the arbitration clause are unenforceable under Article 1.81(5) of the Constitution, and notes that the Respondent therefore did not proceed to file for arbitration. The Respondent acknowledges that, under certain circumstances, a party may waive a jurisdictional argument by commencing and prosecuting an arbitration, or by participating without raising a jurisdictional defence, but the Respondent asserts that such circumstances are not present here.120\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 8 (question 7).\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal should reject the Claimant\u2019s request for the issue of an anti-suit injunction, first, because the proper forum for adjudication of the constitutional issue is the Ghana Supreme Court, and, second, because it is doubtful that an arbitral tribunal has competence to restrain the Ghana Supreme Court from interpreting the Constitution of Ghana.121 The Respondent also disputes the necessity for a confidentiality order, and argues that it is appropriate for both the Tribunal and the Ghanaian courts to have full knowledge of the positions taken by the Parties in each of the proceedings, and that no extraordinary circumstance meriting a confidentiality order exists.122\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 31; Hearing Transcript, 30:13-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 31-32; Hearing Transcript, 31:1-22.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, the Respondent states that it appears from the Notice of Arbitration that all of the Claimant\u2019s claims are premised on the existence of a valid and enforceable PPA which the Respondent is alleged to have breached. Therefore, the Respondent suggests that it cannot conceive of issues in dispute between the Parties that are unconnected to the constitutional questions and thus subject to arbitration.123\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 8-9 (question 8).\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n--------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimant, by contrast, maintains that the Tribunal is the competent and correct decisionmaker as to its own jurisdiction, as well as to the validity of the PPA and the validity of the arbitration clause.124\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 42; Claimant\u2019s Answers to Questions Submitted to the Parties by the Arbitral Tribunal at the Hearing of 15/10/10, 5 November 2010 (\"Claimant\u2019s Third Submission\"), at 5 (question 6).\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant invokes the principle of competence-competence, which it argues is a universally accepted principle of international commercial arbitration and a general principle of international law, and which includes the right of the arbitral tribunal to decide on objections raised to the validity of an arbitration agreement.125 According to the Claimant, arbitral tribunals virtually always find that they have power to consider and to decide the extent of their own jurisdiction.126\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 44, 50; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 5 (question 6).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 40.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the arbitration rules in all major jurisdictions, as well as those applicable in this dispute, recognize the competence-competence principle. In this regard, the Claimant refers to Article 1052(1) of the DCCP127 and to Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.128 In addition, the Claimant argues that the New York Convention, to which the Republic of Ghana and The Netherlands are signatories, effectively prescribes the recognition of competence-competence in international arbitrations.129 It is the Claimant\u2019s position that the Tribunal was first seized of all issues in dispute between the Parties, and that, under the doctrine of competence-competence and under the New York Convention regime, the Tribunal, having been seized first, thus has full authority to make findings in relation to the subsidiary issue\u2014the applicability of Article 181(5)\u2014that is before the Ghanaian courts.130 The Claimant argues that it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to brush aside the concept of competence-competence in order to allow the Ghanaian courts to first decide on Article 181 (5).131\n\nArticle 1052(1) of the DCCP provides: \"The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to decide on its own jurisdiction\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 5 (question 6). Article 21(1) UNCITRAL Rules provides: \"The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause or of the separate arbitration agreement\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 51.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 2).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 5 (question 6).\n\n86.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s argument that the validity of the arbitration agreement is objectively non-arbitrable erroneously shifts the arbitrability inquiry away from the merits of the dispute to the validity of the arbitration clause and to the question of the Tribunal\u2019s competence. The Claimant argues that, in this way, the Respondent denies the principle of competence-competence, under which arbitration tribunals, once arbitration proceedings have been initiated, always have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the arbitration agreement in the first instance. The argument would also render ineffective any arbitration agreement to which the Respondent is a party.132 The Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s contention that competence-competence applies with lesser force where the validity of the arbitration agreement is questioned.133\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission to Respondent\u2019s Brief Regarding Procedural Order No. 1, 4 October 2010 (\"Claimant\u2019s Reply Submission\"), para. 13-18; Hearing Transcript, 49:17-50:11; 51:19-52:11; 52:353:10; 62:10-22.\n\nHearing Transcript, 53:11-54:15.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, through the arbitration clause, the Parties did in fact agree that the applicability of Article 181(5) of Ghana\u2019s Constitution would be determined by an arbitral tribunal, and suggests that, in view of the Respondent\u2019s identity as a sovereign state, the Tribunal is the more appropriate forum to make such a determination in this dispute.134 The Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s earlier reliance on the PPA and invocations of the arbitration clause, before the Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration, are patently inconsistent with the Respondent\u2019s current positions that the PPA and the arbitration clause are invalid and that the dispute is non-arbitrable. The Claimant asserts that it indeed filed the Notice of Arbitration in reaction to the Respondent\u2019s earlier position.135\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 2).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 (question 7).\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimant further maintains that Dutch, rather than Ghanaian, law applies to questions of objective arbitrability. In this respect, the Claimant refers to Article 1073 of the DCCP, which provides that the Netherlands Arbitration Act (Articles 1020 to 1073 of the DCCP) applies to domestic and international arbitrations in the Netherlands, and to Article 1020 of the DCCP, which the Claimant argues provides substantive rules of objective arbitrability.136 Moreover, the Claimant argues that the conflict of laws rules (private international law), including the cumulative approach employed by the Respondent, should not be used to determine the law applicable to arbitrability, but, rather, only to determine the substantive contract law applicable to the arbitration agreement.137 In the Claimant\u2019s view, even if the formal validity of the arbitration clause is governed by Ghanaian substantive contract law, Ghanaian law does not govern issues of arbitrability. This is because, in addition to the clear language of Article 1073 of the DCCP, Tribunals usually determine the arbitrability of a dispute on the basis of the law of the place of arbitration, except in exceptional cases involving matters of public policy.138 The Claimant argues that that this approach accords with the New York Convention.139\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 39, 70; Claimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 21; Hearing Transcript, 45:13-20; 46:23-47:2,\n\nHearing Transcript, 120:3-13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 22-23, Hearing Transcript, 121:13-122:21; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 (question 1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, paras. 23-24, 27; Hearing Transcript, 48:18-49:16; 50:12-18. The Claimant asserts that, under the Convention, a State court outside the seat of arbitration may deny recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award if the subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under its laws. However, this decision has no extraterritorial effect, particularly in the country where the award was validly made. Thus, although enforcement of any award may be challenged in Ghana, the Claimant asserts that the Arbitral Tribunal may decide the claim before it, and that State courts worldwide may recognize and enforce any award issued. Claimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 34. Moreover, under the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Rules, a State court may also refuse to refer a dispute to arbitration; however, this decision in no way binds the arbitrators. Hearing Transcript, 50:19-51:9.\n\n89.\n\nIn contrast to the Respondent, the Claimant argues that Article 1020(3) of the DCCP contains a substantive rule of objective arbitrability, by providing that matters of Dutch public policy may not be decided by arbitration.140 The Claimant maintains that, under this provision, there is no reason to find that the interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution is non-arbitrable.141 First, in the Claimant\u2019s view, the public policy exceptions to arbitrability under Dutch law are exceedingly narrow.142 Second, the Claimant argues that, under Dutch law, the vesting of exclusive jurisdiction in a specific court, such as Article 130 of the Ghanaian Constitution appears to do, does not necessarily exclude arbitration.143 Finally, the Claimant submits that arbitral tribunals frequently apply constitutional provisions, and frequently decide claims that involve making decisions on issues of public policy. In this regard, the Claimant suggests that, among other constitutional rights and obligations, arbitral tribunals regularly apply Article 17 of the Dutch Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provide that parties may waive their fundamental right of access to the courts by agreement, when ruling on objections to their own jurisdiction.144\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 70; Claimant\u2019s Reply Submission, paras. 21, 31; Hearing Transcript, 45:2146:17.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, paras. 30-32.\n\nHearing Transcript, 45:21-46:17; 55:16-56:16; 124:1-23.\n\nHearing Transcript, 56:23-57:7; 122:22-123:16.\n\nHearing Transcript, 57:15-58:19; 124:1-125:24; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 (question 1).\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, if the Respondent\u2019s approach were adopted and constitutional questions were deemed non-arbitrable across the board, governments could effectively block all arbitral proceedings against them by alleging that interpretation of a constitutional question is required. In this regard, the Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s current argument is a mere scheme to bring the Parties\u2019 dispute under the control of Ghanaian State courts.145\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 33.\n\n91.\n\nEven assuming, for the sake of argument, that Ghanaian law governs objective arbitrability, the Claimant offers two arguments as to why the present dispute is arbitrable, under Ghanaian law. First, the Claimant asserts that Article 130 of the Ghanaian Constitution does not necessarily render the interpretation of the Ghanaian Constitution non-arbitrable. This is because, in the Claimant\u2019s view, the vesting of exclusive jurisdiction in a specific court does not normally imply that arbitration is excluded. Rather, a court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction is intended to exclude the jurisdiction of other courts, and not that of arbitral tribunals.146\n\nHearing Transcript, 56:23-57:7; 122:22-123:16.\n\n92.\n\nSecond, assuming that Ghanaian law were to govern objective arbitrability, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal may nonetheless decide whether the arbitration clause is an international business or economic transaction because this determination does not require \"interpretation and enforcement\" of the Ghanaian Constitution.147 In the Claimant\u2019s view, Ghanaian case law makes clear that a genuine matter of constitutional interpretation that would trigger the Supreme Court\u2019s exclusive original jurisdiction arises only where a question of constitutional law is ambiguous or unclear. A mere allegation that there is an issue of constitutional interpretation is insufficient.148 The Claimant refers to, *inter alia,* the Ghana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Agyekum v. Boadi,* which, in its view, held that where a question has been determined by the Supreme Court, reference from another court or tribunal for interpretation is not appropriate.149 The Claimant argues that, in this case, the Ghana Supreme Court has already ruled on the dispositive issue, in its decision in *Faroe Atlantic Co. Limited v. Attorney General.* In the Claimant\u2019s view, *Faroe Atlantic* defined an international business or economic transaction as one between the Government of Ghana and a foreign company, and held that the nationality of the company is determined by its place of incorporation.150 The Claimant argues that the Tribunal can easily apply this decision to the present case, and that\u2014in view of the undisputed fact that the Claimant is incorporated under the law of Ghana\u2014any future challenge to enforcement in Ghana would not succeed.151\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 144, 154.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 162-166; Hearing Transcript, 71:6-72:16; 74:21-75:21; 76:1-12.\n\nHearing Transcript, 76:19-77:6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 163-168; Hearing Transcript, 67:3-17; 69:2-15; 76:13-18; 77:8-16; 80:6-21, 116:15-118:15.\n\nHearing Transcript, 126:24-127:17.\n\n93.\n\nAs an additional matter, the Claimant raises allegations that the proceedings in Ghana have not been instituted and prosecuted in good faith, but rather in an attempt to frustrate the arbitral proceedings. According to the Claimant, a genuine interpretation or enforcement action must be commenced in the Supreme Court, and cannot be commenced in the High Court.152 The only other route to the Supreme Court is provided in Article 130(2), via referral by a court seized of proceedings in which an issue of interpretation or enforcement arises.153 However, a Party may not cause delay in arbitral proceedings by filing an interpretation or enforcement action in the High Court in the expectation of a reference to the Supreme Court.154 The Claimant asserts that if the proceeding initiated by the Respondent were to be considered an interpretation or enforcement action, the High Court would have been without jurisdiction to issue an injunction against the Claimant.155\n\nHealing Transcript, 75:22-24; 72:23-73:7; 77:17-23.\n\nHearing Transcript, 77:24-78:4; 78:5-12.\n\nHearing Transcript, 78:13-79:5; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 2).\n\nHearing Transcript, 73:21-74:14.\n\n94.\n\nIt was the Claimant\u2019s contention at the 15 October 2010 hearing that no interpretation or enforcement action relating to the PPA or to the arbitration agreement was then pending before the Ghana Supreme Court.156 It was also argued then that, before reference may even be made to the Ghana Supreme Court, the pleadings must close; the Parties must go through a 30-day mandatory mediation in the Commercial Court; the Commercial Court must set down the issues for trial to determine whether a reference needs to be made; and the latter decision may be appealed.157 The Claimant disputed the Respondent\u2019s contention that arbitration would commence if the Ghana Supreme Court found that Article 181(5) did not apply to the agreements. The Claimant asserted that the Respondent would instead attempt to avoid arbitration by reviving its claim for relief for fraudulent misrepresentation that it argued before the Ghana High Court as an alternative basis for relief, should it not prevail in the Ghana Supreme Court.158\n\nHearing Transcript, 66:11-23; 73:8-20; 74:17-20; 80:22-81:4; 109:2-110:8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 81:5-17; 111:6-113:15.\n\nHearing Transcript, 110:9-111:5.\n\n95.\n\nAs noted above, both referral and pre-trial conference procedures were started subsequent to the Tribunal\u2019s hearing on 15 October 2010, following the Respondent\u2019s application of 3 November 2010 to the Ghana High Court for reference to the Ghana Supreme Court. In particular, the Claimant now asserts that it was served, on 5 November 2010, with a notice that the mandatory 30-day mediation has been fixed to begin on 22 November 2010. The Claimant maintains that it does not expect a decision from the Ghana Supreme Court until the 2011-2012 legal year. This is because, even if the reference action is successful, it will follow an elaborate statutory process, involving a transfer of the entire record to the Supreme Court and further filings and oral testimony by the Parties. The Claimant contends, further, that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will not end the matter. Rather, the High Court must then resume its hearing in order to dispose of the case according to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The Claimant states that it does not anticipate the High Court proceedings will conclude within one year after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The time-frame could be further extended by several years should either or both Parties pursue appeals.159\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 2).\n\n96.\n\nWith regard to the question raised by the Tribunal at the 15 October 2010 hearing, i.e., whether the Parties can conceive of issues in dispute between them that are not related to the questions regarding the applicability of the Ghanaian Constitution, the Claimant respectfully invited the Arbitral Tribunal to consider, first, whether the Respondent has become unjustly enriched, or has gained unjust benefits, at the Claimant\u2019s expense. In this regard, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent, through its Attorney-General, represented to the Claimant that all acts and conditions required to make the PPA valid, legal, binding, and enforceable had been done. The Claimant further asserts that this representation induced the Claimant to enter into the PPA and to expend considerable sums on the Barge, which remains in the Respondent\u2019s legal ownership.160\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 (question 8).\n\n97.\n\nSecond, the Claimant invites the Tribunal to consider whether the Respondent, by raising the constitutional defence and by seeking to withdraw from the effects of the opinions and letters written by the prior Attorney-General and by the Minister for Energy, had independently committed the torts of negligent advice and of deceit. In regard to the tort of negligent advice, the Claimant argues that, by rendering the legal opinion addressed to the Claimant, Ghana\u2019s Attorney-General assumed, on behalf of the Respondent, a fiduciary duty toward the Claimant. The Claimant argues that, if the advice given by the Attorney-General was false, then since in this situation only the Respondent could have obtained the needed Parliamentary approval, it can establish the special relationship and reasonable reliance required to make out a claim for negligent advice. Further, with regard to the tort of deceit, the Claimant argues that, if the Attorney-General\u2019s opinion was false, the Claimant can establish the deliberate false representation, inducement, and detrimental reliance required to make out such a claim. In the Claimant\u2019s view, these tort claims are within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and are unconnected to the questions regarding the applicability of the Ghanaian Constitution.161\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 7 (question 8).\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s findings*\n-------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal must note first that, while the Parties agree that the PPA is governed by Ghanaian law, they disagree as to which law governs the arbitration agreement. Dutch law is favoured by the Claimant, while the Respondent maintains that Ghanaian law is the proper law. This issue has arisen in numerous international arbitrations and procedures conducted before national courts. The Tribunal will first set out its views as to the legal framework that governs this arbitration, which will also be determinative of its own jurisdiction or lack thereof.\n\n99.\n\nTwo bedrock principles of international arbitration bear on the issues before the Tribunal, namely, the principle of competence-competence, and the principle of separability of the arbitration clause from the contract of which it is part. As the Respondent has rightly pointed out, the first principle concerns the power of the arbitral tribunal to decide jurisdictional issues when the arbitration clause is challenged, while the second concerns the substantive validity of the arbitration clause.162\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 5-6 (question 6).\n\n100.\n\nIt is universally agreed that under the principle of competence-competence an international arbitral tribunal is entitled to determine its own jurisdiction. This principle was first developed as a rule of public international law governing arbitration between States. That rule is rooted in State practice going back to the 18th Century. In the *Award in the Case of The Betsey* it was declared that: \"the doubt respecting the authority of the commissioners to settle their own jurisdiction was absurd;... they must necessarily decide upon cases being within or without their competency\".163\n\nLord Chancellor Loughborough, 13 April 1797, *reported in* J. B. Moore, History and Digest of the International Arbitrations to which the United States Has Been a Party (1898), p. 327.\n\n101.\n\nThat the same rule applies to international arbitration has also been well established under the authority of the International Court of Justice. In the *Nottebohm Case* it was thus held that \"Paragraph 6 of Article 36 [of the Statute of the Court] merely adopted, in respect of the Court, a rule consistently accepted by general international law in the matter of international arbitration. Since the *Alabama* case, it has been generally recognized, following earlier precedents, that, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, an international tribunal has the right to decide as to its own jurisdiction and has the power to interpret for this purpose the instruments which govern that jurisdiction. This principle was expressly recognized in... the Hague Conventions.... The Rapporteur of the Convention of 1899 had emphasized the necessity of this principle, presented by him as being \u2018of the very essence of the arbitral function and one of the inherent requirements for the exercise of this function\u2019. This principle has been frequently applied and at times expressly stated\".164\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Preliminar)\u2019 Objection),* Judgment of 18 November 1953, I .C.J. Reports 1953, pp. 111, 119.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the Hague Conventions referred to by the International Court of Justice are the international treaties that established the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the institution which administers the instant case. As it has been noted, Article 22.2 of the PPA stipulates that \"[i]f any dispute arises out of or in relation to this Agreement and if such dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions of the Parties, the matter shall be referred to binding arbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration... The Hague, The Netherlands.... Applications may be made to such court for judicial recognition of the award and/or an order of enforcement as the case may be. Arbitration shall be governed by and conducted in accordance with UNCITRAL rules\".\n\n103.\n\nThe Parties have much relied in their pleadings on Born\u2019s writings on international commercial arbitration. Bom notes that \"[t]he competence-competence doctrine is almost universally accepted in international arbitration conventions, national legislation, judicial decisions, institutional rules and international arbitral awards. Authority in each of these sources recognizes with relative unanimity some version of a competence-competence doctrine. As a consequence, the basic proposition that an international arbitral tribunal presumptively possesses jurisdiction to consider and decide upon its own jurisdiction can be considered a universally recognized principle of international arbitration law. That is confirmed by the almost complete absence of any authority denying the competence-competence of arbitral tribunals to consider and decide jurisdictional challenges, subject to subsequent judicial review.165\n\nGary B. Bom, International Commercial Arbitration (2009), Vol. 1, pp. 855-856.\n\n104.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 explicit choice in Article 22.2 of the PPA\u2014that arbitration would be governed by the UNCITRAL Rules\u2014also leads this Tribunal to examine the applicable provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 21 provides: \"1. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause.... 2. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to determine the existence or the validity of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms a part. For the purposes of Article 21, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract and which provides for arbitration under these Rules shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail *ipso jure* the invalidity of the arbitration clause\".\n\n105.\n\nFurthermore, Article 22.2 of the PPA establishes a connection with the Netherlands and thus with Dutch law. Article 1052(1) of the DCCP has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal insofar as it reflects the competence-competence principle in unequivocal terms: \"The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to decide on its own jurisdiction\". The same principle is reflected in Ghanaian legislation as contained in the GADRA.166\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent observes in its Reply Brief, at 12, that the GADRA provides \"as a general rule, that the Tribunal has the power to rule on objections to its jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause\".\n\n106.\n\nThe second basic principle which sets the legal framework for this Tribunal\u2019s decision on the issue of jurisdiction is the principle of separability\u2014or severability or autonomy\u2014of the arbitration clause of a contract from the contract of which that clause forms part. This principle is encapsulated in the last two sentences of the foregoing paragraph 2 of Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n107.\n\nHow and to what extent separability is recognized in international arbitration and practice is again well explained by Bom: \"a recurrent and virtually universal theme in national arbitration legislation, judicial decisions and arbitral awards, across common law, civil law and other legal systems, has been that arbitration agreements may be\u2014and presumptively are intended by their parties to be\u2014separable from the underlying contracts with which they are associated.... The breadth and consistency of the acknowledgements of the separability presumption demonstrate the presumptions\u2019s universal and enduring character\".167\n\nGary B. Bom, International Commercial Arbitration (2009), Vol. I, p. 348; *see also generally* pp. 311407.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal will return to this principle in connection with the validity of the arbitration agreement to be discussed below. At this point, however, it should be noted that even where Ghanaian law applies to the PPA, this is not necessarily so in respect of the PPA\u2019s arbitration clause as the Respondent maintains. In fact, as noted above, the Respondent believes that Ghanaian law should be applied to the arbitration clause because the Parties specifically subjected the PPA to the laws of Ghana, and the default position in international arbitration is that a choice of law provision in the main contract also applies to its arbitration clause. However, in the light of the provisions of numerous arbitration rules and the consistent practice in support of the principle of separability, Born\u2019s conclusion is that the opposite seems to be the correct presumption.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that the Respondent accepts that a challenge to the existence, validity or legality of the underlying contract will not necessarily affect the validity of the arbitration agreement under the doctrine of separability, and that consequently the arbitration clause need not be invalid simply \"because\" of the invalidity of the underlying contract. But while it appears that the Respondent recognizes the principle of separability to this extent, the Respondent nevertheless asserts that the same law that applies to the validity of the underlying contract may also apply to the arbitration agreement and may independently render the arbitration agreement invalid.168\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 5-6 (question 6).\n\n110.\n\nAlthough this argument is no doubt ingenious it does not appear to take account of the fact, as will be discussed in greater detail in the next section, that the law applicable to the underlying contract could be different from the law applicable to the arbitration agreement and that, where this is the case, the validity of the arbitration clause will need to be decided by reference to a set of rules that may be wholly different from those to be applied to the underlying contract. In addition, the argument leads to the conclusion that, while the Respondent appears to be accepting the principle of separability in theory, in practice it is claiming that the arbitration agreement should still follow the fate of the underlying contract.\n\n111.\n\nInstead, by virtue of the principle of separability, even if the Respondent\u2019s contentions that the PPA is void *ab initio* were sustainable, and if they were to be sustained, whether by the Ghana Supreme Court or by another Ghanaian judicial body or by this Tribunal, the arbitral clause of the PPA could remain valid and in force. Thus, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to take decisions, for example, regarding the consequences arising from invalidity of the PPA or on other matters unconnected to the objections to the validity of that contract would not be affected by any such hypothetical determination.\n\n112.\n\nThe issues of the substantive validity of the PPA under the Constitution of Ghana and its consequences for the rights and obligations of the Parties pursuant to their contractual undertakings are, in essence, questions pertaining to the merits of the dispute, and they do not affect the validity or otherwise of the arbitration agreement. The Claimant has rightly argued in this connection that the principle of objective arbitrability, as invoked by the Respondent, would shift the focus of the issues to be decided by the Tribunal from the merits of the dispute to the arbitration agreement itself and this would in effect deny the application of the principle of competence-competence. As indicated above, the Tribunal is not deciding any question pertaining to the merits at this stage. It will, however, examine below the question of objective arbitrability discussed by the Parties.\n\n113.\n\nThe Parties have also discussed the meaning of the New York Convention in the context of the issue of competence-competence. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent\u2019s contention that the application of the New York Convention may eventually lead to conflicting decisions on enforcement in different jurisdictions; but the Tribunal also notes that it is a fundamental principle of international arbitration that a tribunal should attempt to render an enforceable award. In any case, it is one thing to assert that when an issue of the enforcement of an award arises in Ghana, the Ghanaian courts will apply their own law based on which court has the authority to interpret the Constitution, but it is quite another matter to conclude from this that the Tribunal should, therefore, abstain from exercising its own jurisdiction. That national courts in the country of the seat of the arbitration, or in States in which enforcement of the arbitral award is sought, may exercise appropriate judicial review is unquestioned, but that does not detract from this Tribunal\u2019s duties and powers to pass upon its own jurisdiction.\n\n114.\n\nThe New York Convention does not expressly treat competence-competence (or separability). Nothing in the Convention expressly requires (or debars) application of those established doctrines. But, as Bom points out, Articles 11(3) and V(1) of the Convention recognize that both arbitral tribunals and courts may consider and decide disputes about the arbitrators\u2019 jurisdiction. Articles V(1)(a) and V(1)(c) of the Convention contemplate that an arbitral tribunal may have made an award notwithstanding jurisdictional objections and will have addressed issues of the validity of the arbitration agreement. The fact that such determinations are subject to judicial review, as at the stage of enforcement, has as its premise that arbitral tribunals are entitled to pass upon their jurisdiction without prior judicial determination.169 The Tribunal will consider other pertinent aspects of the meaning of the New York Convention further below.\n\nGary B. Born, International Commercial Arbitration (2009). Vol. I, pp. 857-858. Article 11(3) of the New York Convention provides: \"The court of a Contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an agreement within the meaning of this article, shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed\".  \n Article V(1) provides in full:\n\n1. Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that:\n\n(a) The parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or\n\n(b) The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or\n\n(c) The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it containes decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decision on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that the part of the award which contains decisions on matter submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced; or\n\n(d) The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or\n\n(e) The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authoritarbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or\n\n(f) The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.\n\n115.\n\nThe principles of competence-competence and separability, as embodied in Dutch and Ghanaian legislation, in Article 21 of the governing UNICTRAL Rules and in international arbitral conventions and international arbitral jurisprudence, practice and the opinion of qualified commentators, provide the legal authority for this Tribunal to decide on its own jurisdiction. Above all, this Tribunal is not free to leave aside the UNCITRAL Rules, which the Parties have freely selected to govern the conduct of the arbitration. The Respondent does not appear to deny this conclusion but only to suggest that, as a matter of practical convenience, deference should be accorded to Ghanaian courts for the resolution of the threshold constitutional issue identified. This is a separate matter that the Tribunal will discuss below.\n\n**B. The issue of the validity of the PPA and the Parties\u2019 obligations under the Agreement to Arbitrate in respect of the current proceedings.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n----------------------------\n\n116.\n\nAs noted above, the Respondent contends that the conclusion of both the PPA and the arbitration clause contained therein raises \"serious questions\" as to their validity under the Ghanaian Constitution. Specifically, the Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s contention that Parliamentary approval was not required for the agreements because they were concluded with a local Ghanaian entity. In the Respondent\u2019s view, whether an agreement is an \"international business or economic transaction\" is not determined solely by the contracting party\u2019s state of incorporation, but also by reference to the substance of the transaction.170 Indeed, the contracting party\u2019s state of incorporation is only one of many factors that are relevant to the question whether a transaction is international in nature. The Respondent asserts that this latter statement is particularly true where, as here, the Claimant appears to have been incorporated just days before the conclusion of the PPA; the Respondent, in fact, suggests that local incorporation may have been undertaken in an attempt to circumvent Article 181(5).171 The Respondent further refers to commentary on the Article\u2019s legislative history, which observes that approval is required for transactions with a \"foreign company, firm or transnational corporation,\" a description which it asserts fits the Claimant.172 The Respondent suggests that the interconnected web of affiliated companies known as the Balkan Group is controlled and operated from the United States, and that the Balkan entities are treated as mere departments or agents of one another. In this regard, the Respondent refers to several examples, including the execution by Balkan US, rather than by the Claimant, of a subcontract for refurbishing work to be done on the Barge, as well as the threat by Balkan UK to institute a BIT arbitration against the Respondent arising out of the same acts and injuries alleged in the instant dispute. For all of these reasons, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant is not an independent company, but is instead part of a larger multinational corporation, on which the Claimant relies for the finances and management of its operations, and to which it defers to enter into contracts on its behalf.173\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 8-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 8-9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4). The Respondent also suggests that the Balkan Group \"appears to disguise its operations through the use of fictitious entities\". In this regard, the Respondent refers to the Memorandum of Understanding entered into between Balkan US and the Government of Ghana, as well as to the Claimant\u2019s recent filings in the Ghana High Court, in both of which Balkan US is represented as a \"private corporation duly organized and existing under the law of the Netherlands\". The Respondent suggests that a search of the Dutch Trade Register reveals that no such company exists. Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4). Irrespectively of this discussion, the corporate structure of BEC has been set out at paragraph 1 of this Interim Award.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that both the PPA and the arbitration clause are \"international business or economic transaction[s],\" and are therefore void and unenforceable for lack of prior Parliamentary approval. In this regard, the Respondent contends that business transactions often involve several elements of either a local or international character \"which cannot be meaningfully separated for purposes of parliamentary scrutiny\".174 To support its contention regarding the \"international character\" of the PPA, the Respondent refers to foreign ownership, management, and control of the Claimant; the signing of a subcontract between Balkan US and a subcontractor for work to be done on the Barge; and several \"international\" provisions in the PPA.175\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 9 n.7, 24 n. 17.\n\n118.\n\nAs for the arbitration clause, the Respondent argues that \"there is no serious question\" that it is \"substantively international in nature\".176 The Respondent notes that the agreement provides for international arbitration before an international tribunal, using international rules of arbitration adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in the context of international commercial relations. The Respondent further refers to the foreign and commercial nature of any award that would be rendered, whether under the New York Convention or the GADRA, and asserts that, in essence, the agreement subjects the Respondent to foreign liability before a foreign tribunal.177 The Respondent further asserts that the clause is properly defined as a \"transaction\" between the Parties because it concerns or affects their material resources or welfare, and because international arbitration is generally recognized to involve and to represent significant commercial business interests.178 The Respondent objects to the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the arbitration clause as solely a \"procedural\" clause, and argues that, in any event, this position undermines the Claimant\u2019s argument that international public policy should be applied to \"correct\" the application of Ghanaian law to the clause.179\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 23-24; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 25.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent suggests that the context and intent of Article 181(5) further underscore its applicability to the arbitration clause. In this regard, the Respondent asserts that other provisions in Article 181 require Parliamentary approval of all loans made by the Government of Ghana, in order to check Executive authority to enter into agreements directly affecting public finances. In the Respondent\u2019s view. Article 181(5) extends this restraint to all international business and economic transactions, in order both to protect against foreign exploitation and to ensure that Ghana is not subjected to foreign liabilities without careful Parliamentary review. The Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s position that Ghanaian law does not apply to the arbitration clause, and that the Ghanaian Executive agreed to waive Ghanaian law, precisely highlights the public policy objective in Article 181(5).180\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 3 (question 4).\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that it is estopped from asserting that the PPA is void *ab initio.* The Respondent refers to the Ghana Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in *Faroe Atlantic* and in other cases for the proposition that principles of estoppel do not apply to, and cannot render enforceable, a contract that is unconstitutional.181 It suggests that the Claimant was not justified in relying on the opinion of the prior Attorney-General, both because these precedents were well-established in Ghana, and because the law of England and of the United States, which are home, respectively, to the Claimant\u2019s sole shareholder and to the Claimant\u2019s ultimate parent company, are in accord. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the laws of all three legal systems hold that a legal opinion of a government official cannot give rise to an estoppel defence or to a claim of reasonable reliance, and that a party that relies on such opinion assumes the risk that it was made in error. Thus, the Respondent denies that the Claimant is entitled to claim that the opinions of the previous Attorney-General can have the effect of excluding the PPA and the arbitration clause from legal review.182 It maintains that, in any event, the purpose of Article 181(5) is to serve as a check on the Ghanaian Executive; and that while, the previous Attorney-General may have expressed his views, the issue remains for the Ghana Supreme Court to decide finally.183 The Respondent further suggests that the Claimant may have used fraudulent representations to induce it to enter the PPA.184 The Respondent asserts that the delay in raising its constitutional objection resulted from its good-faith attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiation with the Claimant.185\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 10; Hearing Transcript, 90:12-24; Respondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 9 (question 9).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Third Submission, at 9-10 (question 9).\n\nHearing Transcript, 89:21-90:11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 3-5; Respondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 2, 16; Hearing Transcript, 90:6-8.\n\nHearing Transcript, 90:25-91:13.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the constitutionality of the arbitration agreement as being a matter of subjective arbitrability or of capacity. In the Respondent\u2019s view, it may clearly enter an arbitration agreement, provided that it does so in compliance with the Constitution. The threshold issues are rather, first, the substantive validity of the arbitration agreement under Ghanaian law, in other words whether an agreement ever came into existence or whether the PPA is void *ab initio* because it did not receive the required Parliamentary approval, and second, whether, as a matter of objective arbitrability, only the Ghana Supreme Court may interpret Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution and its applicability to the agreement.186 The Respondent maintains, further, that even if the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the constitutional issue is accepted, capacity is determined by the law of the place of incorporation\u2014which is Ghana.187\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 17-18; Hearing Transcript, 28:3-14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 18-19; Hearing Transcript, 28:15-18.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s suggestion that Ghanaian law that would invalidate the agreements may be set aside through \"the application of a direct rule of arbitration law, public policy or international law, or by means of correction of the applicable national law of Ghana\".188 In this respect, the Respondent disputes that there is a rule of substantive international law, as alleged by the Claimant, that a State may not invoke its own law to deny capacity. Rather, the Respondent asserts that there are many commonly accepted restrictions on a State\u2019s power to enter into an arbitration agreement.189 The Respondent further distinguishes the present dispute from those referred to by the authorities cited by the Claimant, in that these authorities refer to narrow national legislation strictly limiting Executive authority to enter into arbitration agreements specifically, which served as specific defences to arbitration clauses. By contrast, the Respondent contends that broad-based laws targeting all types of contracts and which are borne out of legitimate policy concerns, such as Article 181(5), are permitted under the New York Convention and will not be set aside.190\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 19; Hearing Transcript, 28:18-21; 29:20-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 20; Hearing Transcript, 28:22-29:13; 101:19-102:24.\n\n123.\n\nFinally, the Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s reliance on the Dutch Supreme Court case of *Defence Industries Organisation of the Ministry of Defence and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (DIO)* v. *International Military\u2019 Services Limited (IMS)* for the proposition that Ghanaian law may be set aside. The Respondent asserts that *DIO v. IMS* merely prevents a State from relying on its own laws to invalidate an arbitration agreement with a foreign entity where the place of performance is outside that State. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the rule does not apply where, as here, the place of incorporation and the place of the agreement are within the State, nor does the Court\u2019s decision provide authority for the broad proposition that public international law should trump Ghanaian law.191 For similar reasons, the Respondent further asserts that the Claimant may not avail itself of a good faith defence grounded in *DIO.* In the Respondent\u2019s view, unlike the foreign entity in *DIO* that had no reason to know that the State in which it was situated and with which it was contracting had a law prohibiting it from entering into an arbitration agreement, in this dispute, the Claimant is incorporated in Ghana and was aware of Article 181(5). Moreover, the Respondent suggests that the opinion of the Attorney-General of Ghana, on which the Claimant purports to have relied, was procured by the Claimant\u2019s own fraudulent representations and, in any event, cannot constitute a waiver of a constitutional mandate.192\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 20-21; Hearing Transcript, 29:15-19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 21.\n\n124.\n\nFinally with regard to the setting aside of Ghanaian law in favour of international legal principles, the Respondent contends that, if the Tribunal were to follow this approach, it would be required to take into account the international public policy interests of developing nations, such as Ghana, whose governments must often undertake commercial transactions due to the paucity of viable private entities. In the Respondent\u2019s view, Ghana\u2019s interest in maintaining the integrity of its Constitution and of its laws should therefore be treated as paramount.193\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 22.\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n--------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the PPA is valid under Ghanaian law, applicable as provided for in paragraph 23 of the PPA, because it is an agreement in writing that has been duly signed by both Parties and that has been in full legal operation for more than three years.194 In the Claimant\u2019s view, the PPA required no Parliamentary or other approval, as expressed in the opinions by the Attorney-General, and no intervening change in the law has rendered it invalid.195 The Claimant maintains that the PPA is not an international business or economic transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5), but rather is a valid contract between the Respondent and itself.196 The Claimant contends that it is a corporate citizen of Ghana, operating as a business in its place of incorporation and abiding by Ghanaian law.197\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 188-189; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 (question 1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 191.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 193.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 195.\n\n126.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant contends, the Respondent is now estopped from relying on Article 181(5) to contest the validity of the PPA.198 The Claimant maintains that it was and is entitled to rely on the Respondent\u2019s representations that the PPA, and in consequence the arbitration clause, were valid, binding, and constitutional. It asserts that these representations were made to it in at least three ways: first, by the Respondent\u2019s provision to the Claimant of the written legal opinion of the Attorney-General of Ghana, which made the clear and unequivocal finding that Article 181 (5) did not apply to the PPA, and that the Respondent had the full power to enter into the PPA; second, by the Respondent\u2019s position, altered only recently, that the PPA was a valid and binding agreement to which it willingly and conscientiously entered; and, third, by the Respondent\u2019s own earlier invocations of the arbitration agreement.199 The Claimant asserts that neither a change in personnel nor a change in government for the Respondent affects the applicability of the estoppel or good faith doctrines; rather, the acts of previous public servants remain attributable to the Respondent.200 The Claimant suggests that, until recently, the Respondent consistently invoked provisions of the PPA when advantageous to itself.201\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, paras. 35, 38.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 7-8 (question 9).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 8 (question 9).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 196.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant further relies on established international law principles of good faith, prohibition of inconsistent behavior, and prohibition of going against one\u2019s own previous conduct. In these regards, the Claimant refers to the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts of 2004, as well as to *Lex Mercatoria* principles, rules, and standards. It argues that, in particular, the prohibition of inconsistent behavior is regularly applied by arbitral tribunals as a general principle of international law, and it refers to several arbitral awards in which tribunals ruled against State actions that were, in its view, analogous to the Respondent\u2019s actions here.202 Applying the concept to the present circumstances, the Claimant contends that the Respondent cannot now, more than three years after signing the PPA, assert that the validity of the PPA and the arbitration clause are affected by Article 181(5). It maintains that any reasonable party in the Claimant\u2019s circumstances would have understood the Respondent\u2019s representations to indicate that the agreements had been validly concluded and that they continued in force; that it sought and received all reasonable and necessary assurances that the PPA was valid; that no change justifies the Respondent\u2019s change of position; and that the Claimant reasonably relied on the Respondent\u2019s representations in entering into and continuing performance under the PPA.203\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 9-10 (question 9).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 9-10 (question 9).\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimant further maintains that, under the principle of separability, even if the PPA is not valid, the Arbitral Tribunal may consider the arbitration clause as a separate agreement.204 In this respect, the Claimant refers to Article 1053 of the DCCP and to Article 21(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.205 The Claimant argues that the separability principle is so widely recognized that it has become one of the general principles of arbitration.206\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 55-56; *see also* Hearing Transcript, 59:2-60:22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 57-60; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 5 (question 6). Article 1053 of the DCCP provides: \"An arbitration agreement shall be considered and decided upon as a separate agreement. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to decide on the validity of the contract of which the arbitration agreement forms part or to which the arbitration agreement is related\". Article 21(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976 provides: \"The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to determine the existence or the validity of the contract of which an arbitration clause forms part. For the purpose of Article 21, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract and which provides for arbitration under these Rules shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail *ipso jure* the invalidity of the arbitration clause\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 61.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement is distinct from the objective arbitrability of the subject matters in dispute, discussed above. In the Claimant\u2019s view, the validity of the arbitration agreement is determined by Dutch law, including Dutch procedural law related to arbitration and Dutch substantive contract law.207 The Claimant submits that Articles 1020 and 1021 of the DCCP set out the formal requirements for the validity of arbitration agreements.208 In the Claimant\u2019s view, Article 22.2 of the PPA fulfils the requirements under Dutch law for formal validity of the arbitration clause, because the Parties agreed in writing to submit all disputes arising out of or in relation to the PPA to binding arbitration.209 The Claimant submits that Article 22.2 of the PPA also meets the requirements of formal validity set out in Article 11(2) of the New York Convention.210\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 69-75; Hearing Transcript, 49:17-50:11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 71.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 73-75, 77.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 72, 76-77.\n\n130.\n\nAs for the substantive contract law applicable to the arbitration agreement, the Claimant notes that the Parties have not expressly agreed on the governing law. In such situations, the Claimant suggests, it is common for arbitral tribunals to refuse to apply the general choice-of-law clause in the main contract to the arbitration agreement, especially where the Parties\u2019 chosen law would invalidate the arbitration clause.211 In this respect, the Claimant urges that the Tribunal may refuse to apply the choice-of-law clause to the arbitration clause because Ghanaian law discriminates between national and international transactions to which Ghana is a party and thwarts the Parties\u2019 true intentions to arbitrate.212\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 78-81; Hearing Transcript, 47:8-21; 118:18-119:8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 82.\n\n131.\n\nHowever, should the Tribunal wish to proceed instead by applying conflict of laws rules, the Claimant asserts that the conflict of law rules of the seat of arbitration should be applied in determining the substantive law applicable to an arbitration agreement.213 Under Dutch conflict of law rules, the Claimant asserts that the substantive contract law governing the arbitration agreement is either the law chosen by the Parties, or the law most closely connected to the arbitration agreement.214 In the Claimant\u2019s view, following the \"validation principle,\" the Parties may be said to have impliedly chosen the law that will validate the arbitration agreement.215 In addition, with respect to the law most closely connected to the arbitration, the Claimant argues that the general position under Dutch law is that the law of the seat of arbitration is the law most closely connected to the arbitration agreement. Moreover, the Claimant asserts that \"the parties\u2019 explicit choice for The Netherlands as the seat... is a deliberate selection of a neutral forum in order to disassociate the dispute resolution process from the host state\u2019s laws and courts\".216 Thus, under the Claimant\u2019s view, both tests\u2014Party choice and closest connection\u2014favour the application of Dutch contract law to the PPA\u2019s arbitration clause.217 The Claimant argues that, under the New York Convention, the analysis is similar and the outcome identical.218\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 83-84.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 85.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 86-89; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 2 (question 1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 90-92; Hearing Transcript, 47:22-48:8; 118:18-119:14; 119:18-21; 119:23120:2; Third Submission, at 2 (question 1).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 98; Hearing Transcript, 48:9-13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 93-97.\n\n132.\n\nApplying Dutch substantive contract law to Article 22.2 of the PPA, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has raised no contractual defences to its validity, and that the signatures at the bottom of the PPA are proof of the Parties\u2019 agreement to enter into the PPA and into the arbitration agreement.219 Should the Tribunal apply Ghanaian law instead, the Claimant maintains that the same conclusion is reached. However, if Ghanaian law invalidates the arbitration agreement, the Claimant refers again to the validation principle to suggest that Dutch contract law should be applied instead.220\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 99-101.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 102.\n\n133.\n\nIt is the Claimant\u2019s position that the Respondent\u2019s \"constitutional defence\" is most accurately characterized not as a contractual defence, but rather as a matter of subjective arbitrability. That is, the Claimant views the Respondent as asserting that it is prohibited from entering into certain agreements as a matter of public policy.221 According to the Claimant, subjective arbitrability is subject to international public policy, as well as to the application of a substantive rule of international law, and is out of reach of national law.222 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent is attempting to rely on its own domestic laws to invalidate an arbitration agreement to which it previously acceded. In this regard, the Claimant refers to the Respondent\u2019s previous actions of representing, in negotiations, that Article 181(5) did not apply to the PPA; providing a legal opinion from its Attorney-General to the same effect, clearly stating that, under *Faroe Atlantic,* the project between the Government of Ghana and a locally-incorporated company did not come within the ambit of Article 181(5); and invoking the arbitration clause in correspondence with the Claimant.223 The Claimant maintains that Dutch law and international law and international public policy do not permit the Respondent to rely on its own domestic laws to escape the application of an otherwise valid arbitration agreement. In this regard, the Claimant refers to \"consistent\" case law and doctrine,224 and adds that arbitral awards have also been \"remarkably consistent\" on this issue.225 The Claimant also refers to the Dutch Supreme Court case of *DIO v. IMS,* which, in its view, held that Dutch private international law does not allow States to rely on limitations of capacity or authority of which the other contracting party was not and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware.226 The Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s argument that *DIO* requires, for its application, that the contracting party be incorporated outside the offending State. Instead, the case requires only that the contracting party had no reason to be familiar with the offending State\u2019s lack of authority, perhaps because the State entity gave no indication about any limitations, and that the transaction was international in fact.227\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 112, 114-116, 183.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 118, 120, 184.\n\nHearing Transcript, 36:24-38:22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 108.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 122-124; 132-136; 185-186; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 10 (question 9).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 125-129.\n\nHearing Transcript, 64:62:23-65:5; 125:25-126:18.\n\n134.\n\nIndeed, in the Claimant\u2019s view, conduct such as the Respondent\u2019s in the present arbitration is a phenomenon of contemporary concern to arbitration practitioners. The Claimant asserts that anti-arbitration injunctions are rarely meritorious; constitute a threat to the good practice of arbitration; and are at odds with the system of the New York Convention.228 In the Claimant\u2019s view, therefore, to the extent that Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution applies and limits the effectiveness of the arbitration clause, the Tribunal may override it by applying the rules of international law and international public policy discussed,229\n\nHearing Transcript, 41:21-42:15; 42:23-43:5.\n\nHearing Transcript, 61:19-62:15.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that, had the Respondent harboured genuine concern regarding the constitutionality of the agreements and the efficiency of the resolution of the dispute between the Parlies, it should have first raised its jurisdictional objections before the Tribunal, rather than seeking to block proceedings via recourse to its own judicial system.230 It further disputes the Respondent\u2019s claim that the proceedings in Ghana may be concluded within six to eight months.231 In addition, the Claimant contests the Respondent\u2019s invocation of international comity, and notes that the Respondent sought the injunction six months after service of the Notice of Arbitration.232\n\nHearing Transcript, 39:6-23; 40:16-24.\n\nHearing Transcript, 40:24-41:3.\n\nHearing Transcript, 41:4-9.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that, regardless of whether the Respondent\u2019s constitutional argument is characterized as a matter of lack of capacity or objective arbitrability, following the validation principle, Dutch law should be applied.233 However, in the view of the Claimant, even if Ghanaian law were to apply, the arbitration clause is not an international business or economic transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution. Specifically, the Claimant refers to the Ghanaian Companies Code, 1963 (Act 169), which, in its view, provides that a company\u2019s nationality is determined on the basis of its State of incorporation.234 The Claimant refers also to the decision of the Ghana Supreme Court in *Faroe Atlantic* to support the proposition that an international business or economic transaction is one between the Government of Ghana and a company incorporated outside of Ghana.235 In the Claimant\u2019s view, under Ghanaian law, BEC retains its Ghanaian nationality, despite sole ownership by a foreign corporation, Balkan UK. In this regard, the Claimant asserts that the Balkan Group of companies follows a structure seen commonly around the world, in which legally distinct entities form part of a common cluster, but operate in different countries with their own distinct tasks, privileges, and liabilities. The Claimant asserts, in particular, that BEC does not share any common directors with Balkan UK; that one of its own directors is a Ghanaian citizen; and that it is, in all practical aspects, a stand-alone company. The Claimant reiterates that it is incorporated in Ghana, undertakes its business activities in Ghana, has entered contracts for local Ghanaian services and supplies, has employed hundreds of Ghanaian staff over the last three years, pays taxes in Ghana, and complies with Ghanaian law,236 However, should the Tribunal instead find that Article 181(5) of the Ghana Constitution applies because the arbitration clause is an international agreement, the Claimant argues that application of that Article should be restrained in the present case by the rules of international public policy described above,237 as well as by the principles of good faith and estoppel.238\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 140, 142.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 146-147; Hearing Transcript, 67:18-68:14.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 152-153; Hearing Transcript, 67:9-17; 68:15-69:1; 69:8-15.\n\nHearing Transcript, 113:23-115:5; Claimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 4-5 (question 5).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 139, 143, 172-178, 180, 184-187.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 179, 187; Hearing Transcript, 115:12-116:14.\n\n137.\n\nFinally, the Claimant disputes that the arbitration clause is an economic or business transaction at all. In the Claimant\u2019s view, under Dutch law, an arbitration agreement is a mixed obligatory and procedural agreement, not an economic or business transaction.239 The Claimant notes also that neither the GADRA nor the Ghanaian Arbitration Act, 1961 (Act 38) characterizes an arbitration agreement as a business or economic transaction, and that there is no specific requirement under the Ghanaian Constitution for Parliamentary approval of arbitration agreements.240 The Claimant further argues that, even if the arbitration agreement has international components, there is no commercial, business, or economic content to it. The Claimant suggests that, if commercial content were not a condition for an agreement to come within the scope of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, any dispute resolution clause involving international arbitral tribunals to which the Government of Ghana is a party would require Parliamentary approval.241\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 156.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 158-159; Hearing Transcript, 69:16-70:19.

The Tribunal must emphasize in this respect that the question of the substantive validity of the PPA is one to be decided on the merits. Insofar as jurisdiction is concerned, the only pertinent question that the Tribunal must decide at this stage is the validity or otherwise of the arbitration agreement.\n\n139.\n\nTwo issues are intertwined in the assessment of the validity of the arbitration agreement. The first is whether it is permissible for a provision of the Ghanaian Constitution to be interpreted by an entity other than the Ghana Supreme Court, such as this Tribunal. The issue is not, as the Respondent has rightly pointed out, one of subjective arbitrability or capacity to enter into an arbitration agreement as the Claimant appears to characterize the constitutional question raised. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent has this capacity and that it has exercised it beyond doubt. The second issue concerns whether any other legal provision or norm under the applicable law invalidates the arbitration agreement, and the law that should apply in determining that issue. The Tribunal will next examine these issues.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses, first, whether the question of the validity of the arbitration agreement\u2014 and, thus, of the Tribunal\u2019s competence\u2014is objectively arbitrable. According to the Respondent, doubts in this respect arise in view of the provision of Article 130 of the Constitution of Ghana, pursuant to which the Supreme Court has exclusive original jurisdiction \"in all matters relating to the enforcement or interpretation of this Constitution,\" and in view of Article 1 of the GADRA, which it claims exempts from arbitration issues of \"enforcement and interpretation of the [Ghanaian] Constitution.\"\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal commences its enquiry with Article 1020 of the DCCP *(see* Article 1073 of the DCCP). Article 1020(3), cited by both Parties, provides that an arbitration agreement in proceedings subject to the Dutch arbitration law \"shall not serve to determine legal consequences of which the parties cannot freely dispose\". An immediate next question is, of course, which legal order is decisive for the judgment as to whether the parties can freely dispose of certain matters in arbitration. While the Respondent has suggested that Article 1020(3) requires the interpreter to look to the legal order with the closest connection to the dispute\u2014an exercise that, in the Respondent's view, leads to the application of Ghanaian law\u2014 the Claimant maintains that the *lex loci arbitri* should be decisive in all but exceptional circumstances.\n\n142.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal considers that there are strong arguments to be made in favour of defining the scope of arbitrable matters in accordance with the *lex loci arbitri.* As explained in further detail below, the Parties\u2019 agreement to dispute settlement before the PCA is an indicator that the Parties intended to remove questions relating to dispute resolution\u2014as opposed to the substantive performance of the contract\u2014from the place of either Party, to a neutral forum. However, the Tribunal need not reach any definitive conclusion in this respect, as the Tribunal sees no reason, under Dutch or Ghanaian law, that constitutional provisions should be inherently non-arbitrable.\n\n143.\n\nArbitration tribunals are not infrequently confronted with the need to interpret and apply constitutional provisions relevant to the resolution of disputes submitted to them, just as they are normally required to interpret and apply treaties that are relevant to the disputes. There is nothing abnormal in exercising a judicial function necessary for the proper administration of justice. Hence the Tribunal does not consider that, in asserting its competence to determine its jurisdiction in this case, it is disregarding or in any way contradicting the force of Article 130 of the Constitution of Ghana. In the view of the Tribunal, the purpose of that provision, like similar clauses in numerous other constitutions, is to establish the judicial supremacy of the Supreme Court in the organization and allocation of powers in the domestic context of Ghana. When there is a case that transcends national borders because of an arbitration agreement or some other legal commitment, such a provision becomes qualified and not necessarily predominant. Otherwise, as the Claimant has rightly noted, any dispute involving some element of constitutional interpretation, or any dispute in which an objection is raised that there is such an element, which is not difficult to do, would automatically be excluded from international arbitration, in spite of the existence of a clear commitment by the Parties to subject the dispute to arbitration.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this connection that, under Article 1020(3) of the DCCP, the arbitration agreement \"shall not serve to determine legal consequences of which the parties cannot freely dispose\". There is here an explicit recognition that some matters may not be arbitrable by reason of public policy considerations. Yet, as argued by the Claimant, a question of constitutional interpretation\u2014such as that raised by the Respondent\u2014does not necessarily fall within the public policy restriction in The Netherlands, because, if it did, any arbitration agreement or contract which encounters an argument of constitutional nature in a foreign country would be excluded from the jurisdiction of an arbitration tribunal to decide upon.\n\n145.\n\nThe same conclusion can be reached by reference to the provisions of the New York Convention. Under Article II(3) of the Convention, the court of a Contracting State seized of an action arising from an arbitration agreement shall, at the request of a party, refer the matter to arbitration \"unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed\". However, this power to assess the agreement is available only to the court that has been seized of the case, and not to any other court. This is also the case if the body seized of the case is an arbitral tribunal. This is without prejudice to the right of a court in Ghana to apply its own law when it is seized of an award at the stage of enforcement, including the right to apply any relevant requirements of public policy, as provided for under Article V(2)(a) of the Convention. However, this is not an impediment to an arbitral tribunal to decide on its own competence or to make an award on a dispute submitted to it; nor does it affect the powers of other courts that may be called upon to consider enforcement of, or a challenge to, the award in a different country. Otherwise, the principle of competence-competence would be meaningless and without effect.\n\n146.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to the law that should apply to the second issue noted, that is, whether any other legal norm invalidates the arbitration agreement. Based on its argument of Constitutional supremacy as noted above, the Respondent considers that only Ghanaian law, and particularly the relevant provisions of the Ghanaian Constitution, should govern the validity of the arbitration agreement. For its part the Claimant argues that the applicable law should be the Dutch procedural law on arbitration as well as Dutch substantive contract law. In the view of the Claimant, the arbitration agreement is valid under both sets of rules\u2014a conclusion which it maintains would not be different even if Ghanaian law were applied.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that, from a purely procedural point of view, the arbitration clause is valid both under the Netherlands Arbitration Act according to the DCCP, just as it is valid under GADRA and the New York Convention. In fact, all of the requirements for the formal validity of the arbitration clause are unquestionably met. The only problem arises from the constitutional question raised under Ghanaian law, but, in the view of the Tribunal, this is not connected to the formal validity of the clause as it concerns the question of objective arbitrability, i.e., whether the subject matter of the dispute is capable of being decided by arbitration.\n\n148.\n\nAs to which law is applicable to the arbitration clause itself, the Parties, not surprisingly, also have different views. According to the Respondent, it follows from the fact that the PPA is governed by the law of Ghana, a matter which is not disputed by the Claimant, that this law should also apply to the arbitration agreement contained in the PPA. To the contrary, the Claimant contends that, since the PPA did not make an express choice of law in respect of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the seat of arbitration, in this case Dutch law.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the solutions reached by arbitral tribunals, and the views of writers on this issue, differ, with some favouring the view that the arbitration agreement should follow the choice of law applicable to the contract while some others favour the position that, in the absence of express agreement, the applicable law should be that of the seat of arbitration. However, the Tribunal is persuaded that, in deciding this issue, it should favour the approach that is more conducive to making the arbitration agreement effective rather than an approach that would render the agreement ineffective. The Parties agreed to an arbitration clause providing for the resolution of disputes arising under the PPA by arbitration and it is this choice that should prevail and not an interpretation the result of which would be the exact opposite. A contract cannot be deemed to contain a clause which is self-defeating of its objectives. The validation principle invoked by the Claimant lends support to the conclusion that it makes more sense to consider that the Parties opted for an approach that would validate rather than render invalid the arbitration agreement.\n\n150.\n\nThe solution to this issue is also not clear-cut by reference to conflict of law rules. The basic tenet underlying the doctrine of *lis pendens,* however, points in the direction of finding in favour of the law that is most closely connected to the arbitration agreement. In this case it is the law of the Netherlands that appears to have the closest connection with the arbitration agreement under the PPA. This is borne out by the fact that The Netherlands was chosen as the seat of the arbitration and by the explicit decision to operate under the UNCITRAL Rules, which, among other consequences, determines the courts which will be competent to consider any challenge to the award rendered. More important still is the argument invoked by the Claimant to the effect that the choice of the seat of the arbitration in a neutral country indicates a clear understanding that the Parties wish to detach the arbitration agreement from the domestic law or the courts of either Party. The situation is, of course, different with respect to the law applicable to the PPA, since the PPA contains a choice of law provision that expressly subjects the contract to Ghanaian law.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal must emphasize that the New York Convention also supports the conclusion that, in the absence of a choice of law provision in the arbitration agreement, the law of the seat of arbitration should be the applicable law for determining the validity of the arbitration agreement. Indeed, Article V(1)(a) of the Convention provides that an award may not be recognized if the arbitration agreement was not valid under \"the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made\".\n\n152.\n\nIn the light of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the law applicable to the arbitration agreement in the PPA is the law of The Netherlands. In so deciding, the Tribunal wishes to state that this entails no disrespect for the laws of Ghana or of other developing countries. The Tribunal is sensitive to the importance of according due respect to the laws of every sovereign State; and it emphasizes that its decision in the present case is entirely unrelated to any views or judgments regarding the merits of the respective legal systems. Rather, its decision is based solely on its appreciation of which solution appears to be more appropriate for the effective discharge of the dispute resolution functions which have been entrusted to it by the agreement of the Parties themselves.\n\n153.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that its jurisdiction is supported by both the competence-competence and the separability principles and that Dutch law properly applies to the validity of the arbitration agreement, the Tribunal will now examine what Dutch law has to say in this regard. As noted above, the Parties seem to agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that the arbitration agreement meets the basic requirements of contract law and the DCCP. The only open question is whether, *under Dutch law,* the constitutional provisions of a foreign State\u2014in this case, Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana\u2014can constitute grounds for invalidating an otherwise valid arbitration agreement.\n\n154.\n\nAs the Claimant has noted,242 the Respondent has not advanced any particular arguments to demonstrate that Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana is relevant to the validity of the arbitration agreement, if it is agreed that Dutch law is the governing law of the arbitration agreement.243 Instead, the Respondent has argued that Ghanaian law and not Dutch law should apply in the first place and, for that reason, the Constitution of Ghana is directly pertinent.244 As indicated above, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is that the proper law governing the validity of the arbitration agreement is Dutch law. Accordingly, taking account of the Parties\u2019 submissions and upon a careful review of the relevant Dutch law, the Tribunal does not consider that Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana in any way affects the validity of the arbitration agreement.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 99-101.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken due note of the Respondent\u2019s detailed argumentation regarding the question of *objective arbitrability,* including arguments made under the assumption that Dutch law determines which matters are capable of settlement through arbitration. The arguments on this point, however, must be distinguished from the present question of the *validity* of the arbitration agreement, i.e., the question whether there is a legally binding agreement to arbitrate in the first place.\n\nAs the Tribunal has noted, the Respondent has also argued that, as a matter of practicality, even should the Tribunal find that the arbitration agreement is valid, jurisdiction should be refused, in order not confront the question of the validity of the PPA, which the Parties agree is governed by Ghanaian law.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimant has argued in this respect that there is no such constitutional issue in view of the fact that it was the Respondent who represented that Article 181(5) of the Constitution does not apply to the PPA and provided the legal opinions of the Attorney-General to the effect that a contract with a locally-incorporated company, such as BEC, is not affected by the requirement of Parliamentary approval under that Article because the PPA is not an international business or economic transaction. The Tribunal does not find this argument persuasive; and it finds that there is indeed a constitutional issue here. In the view of the Tribunal, the very fact that the Attorney-General had to issue an opinion on the subject indicates that there were questions in this respect of which the Claimant was or should have been well aware at the time of negotiation and conclusion of the PPA.\n\n156.\n\nThe Parties have also argued about the meaning of the 2005 decision of the Ghana Supreme Court in *Attorney General* v. *Faroe Atlantic,* and particularly whether the judgment sufficiently disposes of the constitutional issue raised. In view of the considerations set out above, the Tribunal believes that this issue relates to the merits of the dispute. It is at that stage that the Tribunal will wish the Parties to argue about whether it is only the place of incorporation that should govern the resolution of the constitutional question discussed in *Attorney General v. Faroe Atlantic* or whether consideration should also be given to the nature of the activities undertaken under the contract. Such argument is particularly necessary because it is often the case that international business transactions are carried out through a locally incorporated company that acts as an intermediary. It is indeed the case here that BEC is the vehicle through which the business of an international company was undertaken in Ghana. This is a question that can only be answered in the light of the facts of the present case.\n\n157.\n\nIn this context it will also be appropriate for the Parties to discuss the legal and constitutional effects of the requirement of local incorporation under the law of Ghana for the supply of bulk energy in that country. As explained above, Article 12 of the Ghana Energy Commission Act of 1997 (Act 541) requires that, for a company to hold a license for bulk energy supply in Ghana, it must be incorporated in Ghana. Because of this requirement BEC was registered under the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) of Ghana as a locally incorporated company.\n\n158.\n\nEqually important will be the arguments concerning the legal opinions issued by the Attorney-General, which appeared to state the Government\u2019s understanding about the legal requirements to be observed for the award of the licence and the execution of the PPA. Whether such opinions are the legal expression of a commitment that cannot later be denied, as the Claimant maintains, or simply represent the erroneous opinion of a public official, as the Respondent believes, it is a question to be examined on the merits in connection with the validity of the PPA under both Ghanaian and international law as applicable to this arbitration.\n\n159.\n\nWhile such considerations may be appropriate in respect of the validity of the PPA, the Tribunal does not consider that they are pertinent to the issue of the validity of the arbitration agreement. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is that the validity of the arbitration agreement is not affected by Article 181(5) of the Constitution. Under both Dutch law and Ghanaian legislation an arbitration agreement cannot be considered to be an international business or economic transaction. As argued by the Claimant, if the arbitration agreement is considered invalid, that would mean that any international arbitration agreement to which the Government of Ghana is a party would need to be submitted to Parliamentary approval. Separability acquires a particular significance in this context.\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Respondent is attempting to rely on its own domestic law to invalidate an arbitration agreement to which it previously acceded and implemented, an approach that Dutch law and international law and international public policy do not permit. The Tribunal, while accepting the force of this contention, does not accept the Claimant\u2019s further contention that the Respondent has acted in bad faith.\n\n161.\n\nThe Parties have also discussed in this context the Dutch Appeals Court case of *DIO v. IMS,* but have assigned to it interpretations that are of limited usefulness to the Tribunal in this case. According to the Claimant, the decision of the Dutch Appeals Court supports the view that no reliance should be placed on limitations on the authority of officials or agencies of which the other contracting party was not aware, and could not reasonably have been expected to be aware. However, the Tribunal must point out that, as has been noted above, in the present case the Claimant was either aware or should have been aware of the possible legal difficulty arising from Article 181(5) of the Constitution. For its part the Respondent maintains that, while the decision in *DIO* v. *IMS* declares that a State is not entitled to rely on its own laws to invalidate an arbitration agreement with a foreign entity, this applies only if the place of performance is outside that State, but not if performance is to be within that State, It is not apparent to the Tribunal that this is a correct interpretation of the decision. In the view of the Tribunal, the decision implies that reliance on internal law should not be permissible to invalidate an arbitration agreement whether the place of performance is within or outside of the State. This is the meaning of the general statement of the Appeals Court that: \"The principle that a state or organisation belonging to a state\u2014such as DIO\u2014would not be entiled to argue that an agreement it enters into providing for international arbitration is invalid under its own internal laws, is by now a broadly supported international principle\".245 This conclusion is solidly based on contemporary international precedent, as, for example, in the case of *Benteler v. Belgium.246*\n\n*Defence Industries Organisation of the Ministry of Defence and Support for Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran v. International Military Services Limited,* Judgment, Supreme Court of the Netherlands, 28 January 2005, NJ 2006/469, para. 3.3 (quoting Appeals Court judgment, para. 4.2) (unofficial translation, Claimant\u2019s Reply Submission, Annex 1).\n\n*See Benteler* v. *Belgium,* Award, 18 November 1983, *reported in Journal des Tribunaux* (Brussels, 1984), pp. 230-32, *reproduced in English translation in* 1 *Journal of International Arbitration* (1984), p. 184.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider the issue of estoppel raised by the Claimant in answer to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the PPA is void *ab initio* and this same consideration applies to the arbitration agreement. There is no doubt that, in the instant case, there have been official representations by the Government of Ghana on which the Claimant has relied. The Respondent has suggested that the Claimant may have used fraudulent representations to induce it to enter the PPA and this would render any consideration of estoppel unwarranted. Here, too, the Tribunal considers that the assertion entails a presumption of bad faith on the part of the Claimant. The Tribunal is unable to endorse such a presumption in the absence of convincing evidence to support it.\n\n163.\n\nWhile there may be valid reasons for the Ghanaian Constitution to impose restrictions on the State\u2019s powers to enter into certain kinds of international transactions, there are circumstances where such a restriction cannot derogate from the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement to which the Parties are committed and which has been held out as valid by the competent Ghanaian officials. That is very much the case here. The very fact that the Respondent proposed the alternative of arbitration to settle the dispute indicates that the arbitration agreement was considered by it to be valid and in force, even if the Respondent ultimately decided not to pursue this line of action.247 Indeed, the Claimant has characterized the attitude of the Respondent in this regard as evidence of inconsistent State behaviour.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 6 (question 7); Notice of Arbitration, Exhibits 3 and 4.\n\n164.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes in this respect that, under the applicable principles of international law, the decisions of government officials with apparent authority are attributable to the State. The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility have clearly stated this principle in Article 7, with the added commentary that \"[t]he State cannot take refuge behind the notion that, according to the provisions of its internal law or to instructions which may have been given to its organs or agents, their actions or omissions ought not to have occurred or ought to have taken a different form\".248\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Report of the Work of its Fifty-third Session, Official Records of the General Assembly,* Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), at 45.\n\n165.\n\nMoreover, the approval of business transactions by government officials not objected to as to their legality under local law, and relied upon for a number of years, have been held to amount to estoppel by various arbitral tribunals.249 Whether the situation in the instant case is held to constitute estoppel or some other form of inconsistent behavior, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the arbitration agreement will not be affected.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 9 (question 9); *Ioannis Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 July 2007, para. 194; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited* v. *Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, para. 479.\n\n166.\n\nEven if it were ultimately to be held on the merits that the PPA is invalid\u2014as to which this Tribunal now makes no holding\u2014the arbitration clause will still serve an important purpose because it would enable the Tribunal to take decisions on the consequences of such invalidity for the obligations of the parties to the contract, including consequential questions relating to damages and compensation. The Claimant also suggests that there are other questions, not related to the constitutional issues raised, that would still have to be decided, such as unjust enrichment, tort for negligent advice and liability for false representation.250\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 6-7.\n\n167.\n\nIn the light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the arbitration agreement embodied in Article 22.2 of the PPA is both valid and enforceable independently from the issue of the validity of the PPA, and that the Parties are bound by this commitment to international arbitration.\n\n**C. The question of the Ghana High Court Order and the Ghana High Court Ruling and their effect on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s arguments*\n----------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Ghana High Court Order of 25 June 2010 was validly issued after due notice and hearing and that it is binding on the Parties, who are properly subject to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Therefore, the Respondent submits that, although the Tribunal itself is not subject to the injunction, the Tribunal must \"accord[] respect\" to the injunction.251\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 10-12.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent argues, further, that the Tribunal should accord respect to the Ghanaian injunction because it rests on sound legal grounds. It contends that forcing the Respondent to participate in a matter not properly subject to arbitration constitutes *per se* irreparable harm. The Respondent asserts that the Ghana High Court correctly assessed that the balance of harm falls on the Respondent\u2019s side. The Respondent also contends that, rather than a \"patently improper or parochial court order by a rogue court,\" the Ghana High Court Ruling was based on full briefing and argumentation, was well-reasoned, and applied standards consistent with principles used in common law nations and in rules of international arbitration.252\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 12-13.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, therefore, the Tribunal should suspend proceedings, and should defer to the injunction and to the Ghana Supreme Court\u2019s forthcoming decision on the arbitrability of the dispute.253 The Respondent contends that decisions of arbitral tribunals and decisions of national courts favour deference to a foreign court which is properly seized of the question of arbitrability. In this respect, the Respondent refers to *The MOX Plant Case,* in which the arbitral tribunal suspended its proceedings, in view of the prospect that the European Court of Justice would be seized with a view to determining whether the relevant provisions of the convention at issue were within the European Community\u2019s exclusive competence. The Respondent argues that *MOX Plant* is directly in point and provides a sound basis for the Tribunal to abstain from further proceedings at this stage. The Respondent notes that the Ghana High Court has issued an interlocutory injunction specifically restraining the Claimant from continuing with the proceedings before the Tribunal pending the determination of the Ghana proceedings.254\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 13-15; Hearing Transcript, 91:14-93:4.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, in light of the international law doctrines of li *s pendens* and international comity, an arbitral tribunal has two options when confronting the challenge that a matter before it is non-arbitrable: it may decide that it does not have competence to decide on any of the matters submitted, or it may decide to retain jurisdiction on the matters that it finds to be arbitrable but to suspend the proceedings on the other matters until the question of the arbitrability of the matters challenged has been decided by the competent court.255 The Respondent argues that determinative factors weigh in favour of suspension of the proceedings; the first is that the question of constitutional interpretation raised before the Ghanaian courts is a *bona fide* issue, and not just a pretext to frustrate arbitration, as alleged by the Claimant; and the second is that the Ghana Supreme Court is the most appropriate forum for determination of the constitutional issues, because that court has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional questions, and because the dispute raises fundamental questions with broad public policy implications.256\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 28.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 28-29.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent asserts further that if the Tribunal continues the proceedings, it risks subjecting the Parties to conflicting decisions or to inconsistent judgments. It refers to provisions in the New York Convention that permit non-enforcement of awards that are based on invalid arbitration agreements, or that decide matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration. Additionally, the Respondent submits that an arbitral award that violates a foreign court\u2019s order is itself contrary to public policy, for which enforcement may be refused.257 The Respondent further argues that an order from the Tribunal directing the Parties to proceed would place the Parties in the difficult position of having to choose between violating the Ghana High Court\u2019s injunction, or participating in the arbitral proceedings under protest.258\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief at 15-16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 16.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that deference to the Ghanaian courts should not result in major delay, and that the timing of the referral to the Ghana Supreme Court depended on the Claimant submitting its Statement of Defence. The Respondent argues that it has every reason to have the constitutional issue resolved promptly, as its interests are served neither by having the Barge in continued disrepair, nor by uncertainty as to the proper interpretation of Article 181 (5).259\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Brief, at 30.\n\n174.\n\nFinally, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s insistence that the Tribunal should determine the validity and enforceability of the PPA and of the arbitration clause, or to otherwise urge the Tribunal to proceed with the arbitration, could constitute contempt of the Ghana High Court Order. The Respondent contends that the intent and spirit of the injunction require that the Respondent also refrain from arguing the merits of the constitutional issue before this Tribunal, other than to urge the Tribunal to defer further proceedings pending the outcome in the Ghana litigation.260\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 16-17.\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s arguments*\n--------------------------\n\n175.\n\nin the Claimant\u2019s view, the proceedings in Ghana do not affect the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. The Claimant notes that the Notice of Arbitration was submitted on 23 December 2009, while the request for an injunction was only made on 25 June 2010, that is, six months later. It also points out that the Respondent reacted positively to the notice and responded by nominating an arbitrator. According to the Claimant, the Tribunal was first seized of the dispute and it is, therefore, the appropriate body to resolve it.261 The Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s application for the injunction was not made in good faith,262 and that the grounds relied on for the injunction are without merit.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Third Submission, at 3-4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 198-200, 202-205.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes that the Respondent will suffer any harm as a result of the continuation of the arbitration. In particular, it points out that the Claimant did not in fact obtain an ex parte attachment of all of the Respondent\u2019s bank accounts and property in the Netherlands in February 2010. Rather, the Claimant states that it was merely granted leave to place attachments\u2014and on the Respondent\u2019s bank accounts only\u2014and that it was, in any event, unable to make a successful attachment because none of the relevant accounts contained funds. The Claimant also contests the Respondent\u2019s claim that it was not apprised of this attachment until June 2010. Instead, the Claimant maintains that, consistently with Dutch law, the Respondent was notified of the leave for attachments on 5 March 2010.263 Finally, the Claimant asserts that, on 15 July 2010, it made a specific undertaking to the Ghana High Court that it would not seek any further conservatory attachments of any of Ghana\u2019s assets in any jurisdiction pending the final determination of the arbitration.264\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 208-212, 216, 219, 221, 223-224; Hearing Transcript, 43:6-44:22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 219-220, 227.\n\n177.\n\nIn addition to disputing the grounds on which the Respondent obtained the injunction against the Claimant, the Claimant also maintains that the Ghana High Court Ruling of 6 September 2010 was legally incorrect. In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent cannot succeed on the merits in the Ghanaian litigation, because, as discussed, the dispositive constitutional issue\u2014the definition of an \"international business or economic transaction\"\u2014has already been decided by the Ghana Supreme Court in *Faroe Atlantic.265* The Claimant argues that the Ghana High Court also erred in considering, as a basis of its decision, whether the Tribunal can rule on the Constitution of Ghana, and whether the Tribunal will be bound by the orders of the Ghanaian courts.266\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 225-226.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 230.\n\n178.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the injunction of the Ghana High Court contravenes fundamental principles of international law and undermines the system of international arbitration. In this respect, it refers to the doctrines of competence-competence, party autonomy, and judicial abstention until an award is rendered, as well as provisions of the New York Convention that it interprets as prohibiting domestic courts from blocking arbitration.267 The Claimant notes that, by its terms, the Ghana High Court Order is addressed to the Claimant and not to the Tribunal. In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Tribunal has not only the right but also an obligation, to proceed to consider its own jurisdiction, and the Ghanaian courts are under an obligation to stay the domestic court proceedings until the Tribunal has done so.268 Finally, the Claimant highlights the practical consequences for the system of arbitral dispute resolution if tribunals allow antiarbitration injunctions to interfere with proceedings.269\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 231-232, 234-236, 241-243; Claimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 52.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 237-238.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 242.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimant disputes that *The MOX Plant Case* is analogous to the present dispute. The Claimant distinguishes that case on the basis that, in *MOX Plant,* a strong possibility existed that an exclusive competence over the dispute had been transferred to the European Community under the European Community Treaty. In view of the initiation of proceedings at the European Court of Justice, which would bind the parties and could preclude the jurisdiction of the MOX Plant arbitral tribunal, the arbitral tribunal suspended its proceedings.270 By contrast, in the present dispute, the Claimant contends that the Respondent has subjected itself to the New York Convention, which leaves questions of arbitrability to be decided, first, by the arbitral tribunal.271 Moreover, in the Claimant\u2019s view, in contrast to the petitioner in *MOX Plant,* the Respondent has not sought recourse in the proper forum, but instead has petitioned its own judiciary in order to circumvent the correct processes and to obtain an almost certain favourable decision.272\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, paras. 40-50, 126:19-23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, paras. 50-51.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 53.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the specter of conflicting decisions was only created as a result of the Respondent\u2019s initiation of proceedings in Ghana, despite the arbitration agreement and despite the fact that this Tribunal had been duly appointed.273 The Claimant maintains that the Respondent should have argued its position before the Tribunal and, in case of an unfavourable decision, it could have then applied to the Dutch courts to set aside the arbitration proceedings. In the current situation, the Claimant finds that the only correct solution is for the Respondent to withdraw the Ghanaian court proceedings, rather than risk conflicting decisions.274 In any event, the Claimant contends that the decisions of the Tribunal and of the Ghanaian courts will not in fact conflict, because they will be grounded in different sets of law.275\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 58.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 59; Hearing Transcript, 41:10-16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply Submission, para. 60.\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that the anti-arbitration injunction has restricted its ability to proceed in the ordinary course with this arbitration, including inhibiting its ability to correspond fully and freely with the Tribunal.276 The Claimant fears that it will be prosecuted for contempt of court or will otherwise incur sanctions in Ghana, where its operations continue, as a result of making submissions in these arbitral proceedings.277 It notes that it has already defended in good faith against the claims made by the Respondent in the proceedings in Ghana, but to no avail.278 Further, the Claimant draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the fact that the Respondent has released excerpts from at least one piece of correspondence to the Tribunal from the present confidential arbitral proceedings relating to the instant dispute, in a seeming attempt to prejudice the Ghana High Court against the Claimant.279\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 244; Hearing Transcript, 79:15-17.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 244-245.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, para. 246.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 248-249; *see also* Hearing Transcript, 65:7-14.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal also has the power to issue an anti-suit injunction and to order the Respondent to withdraw its requests currently before the Ghana High Court and to refrain from initiating any further court proceedings in Ghana or elsewhere.280 It argues that a strong signal from the Tribunal that the anti-arbitration injunction is inappropriate will benefit the proceedings.281\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers, paras. 250-254, 256-258.\n\nHearing Transcript, 65:15-66:2.\n\n*The Tribunal \u2019s findings*\n--------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal has stated above that it accords the greatest respect to the decisions of the Ghanaian courts and to the legal system of Ghana as a whole. As also indicated above, the Tribunal has declined to issue an anti-suit injunction against the Respondent, as requested by the Claimant.\n\n184.\n\nHowever, the submission of the Respondent that the Tribunal should defer to the courts of Ghana is a different proposition. In the discussions above regarding the validity of the arbitration agreement and the obligation of the Parties to abide by it, the Tribunal has clearly set out its understanding as to the law applicable to these questions, including the meaning of the relevant Dutch and Ghanaian law and the proper purport of the New York Convention. It is in the light of this understanding that the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that it has jurisdiction to decide the dispute submitted to it by the Parties.\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent has relied heavily on *The MOX Plant Case* to support its request for postponement of the proceedings pending determination of the suits before the courts in Ghana, while the Claimant has argued against such postponement on the grounds that the *MOX Plant* case should be distinguished from the present dispute. The Tribunal believes that the situation and the legal context in the *MOX Plant Case* are different from those in the present case. In the *MOX Plant Case,* the major issue in question was the significance of Article 282 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in resolving the difference between the parties regarding the competing jurisdictions of the Annex VII arbitral tribunal and the European Court of Justice over the issues in dispute. Article 282 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea excludes the jurisdiction of the Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal \"if the parties in the dispute have agreed... that such dispute shall be submitted to another procedure that entails a binding decision\".\n\n186.\n\nBoth of the parties in the *MOX Plant* arbitration, Ireland and the United Kingdom, are parties to the European Community Treaty, Article 292 of which gives exclusive jurisdiction to the European Court of Justice in disputes between Member States concerning the application or interpretation of Community law. Further, in the context of the European Community, now the European Union, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a \"mixed agreement,\" because the European Community is a party to the Convention in its own right and in respect of matters for which responsibility has been transferred to the Community, including matters concerning the protection of the marine environment, maritime safety, and fisheries. It was claimed by the European Commission that a significant part of the dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom relates to provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that were part of Community law and, accordingly, that the application or interpretation of those provisions fell within the \"jurisdictional monopoly\" of the European Court of Justice. The Annex VII arbitral tribunal agreed that, to the extent that this is so, its jurisdiction would be precluded by virtue of Article 282 of the Convention, and the dispute settlement procedures under the European Community Treaty would prevail in its place. In the circumstances, the arbitral tribunal considered it appropriate to adjourn its proceedings to allow for the jurisdictional issues to be definitely resolved. The arbitral tribunal believed that, without this, substantial doubts would remain as to whether its jurisdiction could \"be firmly established in respect of all or any of the claims in the dispute\".282\n\n*The MOX Plant Case (Ireland v. the United Kingdom),* Procedural Order No. 3, 24 June 2003, para. 25, *reported in*Permanent Court of Arbitration Award Series: The MOX Plant Case (Ireland-United Kingdom) Record of Proceedings 2001 -2008 (2010), p. 54.\n\n187.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal does not have any doubts as to its jurisdiction under the arbitration agreement concluded between the Claimant and the Respondent. This will be so irrespective of the decision that may be reached in the Ghanaian courts regarding the validity or enforceability of the PPA. As explained above, the issue of the validity or enforceability of the PPA relates to the merits of the dispute and has no influence on the validity of the arbitration agreement between the Parties or on the competence of the Tribunal to exercise the functions entrusted to it under the agreement.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal must also consider in this context the Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that participation in a matter which it regards as not properly subject to arbitration constitutes *per se* irreparable harm. Arbitral jurisprudence and the opinions of writers on the subject indicate that the question of what constitutes irreparable harm is a difficult one.283 This is even more so when the argument concerns an intangible interest such as the right not to be subjected to inappropriate arbitration. However, it appears to have been well established that harm will only be irreparable when compensation cannot be made available as a remedy.284 In the instant case it is not easy to foresee how damage could ensue from the exercise by the Tribunal of its legal function under the arbitration agreement. And to the extent that some damage might ensue, it must be asked why any such damage should not be capable of being compensated by the exercise of the powers that a tribunal always has, including the power to award costs. The suggestion of the Respondent that the Tribunal might undertake a \"balance of harm\" between the Parties does not appear appropriate in this context, in the light of the commitment of both Parties to resolve any dispute under the PPA by arbitration.\n\nDavid D. Caron, Lee M. Caplan and Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary (2006), p. 537.\n\n*See Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, para. 92; *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf Case,* Interim Protection, Order of 11 September 1976, 1.C.J. Reports 1976, pp. 3, 12.\n\n189.\n\nWith respect to the risk of conflicting decisions or inconsistent judgments that has been raised by the Parties, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that an award will always be potentially subject to a challenge either before the courts of the seat of arbitration or at the enforcement stage before the courts of the place of enforcement, including in this case the courts of Ghana. That is the appropriate moment for applying any controls based on issues of public policy, to the extent permissible under the UNCITRAL Rules and the New York Convention.\n\n190.\n\nThe request by the Respondent for a postponement of the proceedings puts this Tribunal in the invidious position of having to decide between, on the one hand, upholding the validity of the principles of competence-competence and separability and, on the other hand, accepting the consequences arising from an injunction against proceedings in an arbitration which the Parties have previously accepted in a formal and written arbitration agreement. The Tribunal is not only convinced that it has acted correctly in finding in favour of its jurisdiction in the arbitration but it also believes, as the Claimant has argued, that it has an obligation to give effect to the commitment of the Parties to arbitration.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to stress that it is incumbent upon the courts of Ghana, as organs of a State Party to the New York Convention, to pay full regard to the international obligations that the Republic of Ghana has undertaken by becoming a Party to the Convention. This is particularly so under the various provisions of the New York Convention that have been examined above, all of which point in the direction of the obligation to give effect to the arbitration agreement and ultimately to the recognition of the award made. It is beyond controversy that a party to a treaty, such as the New York Convention, is bound to perform it in good faith. As the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties prescribes, a party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. The object and purpose of the New York Convention is to ensure that agreements to arbitrate and the resultant awards are recognized and enforced. It is difficult to reconcile the New York Convention with the issuance of an anti-arbitration injunction that purports to block pursuance of an international arbitral remedy to which the State concerned is committed.\n\n192.\n\nIn the light of these considerations the Tribunal does not consider that its jurisdiction is affected by the Ghana High Court Order and Ruling. Accordingly, it does not consider that postponement of proceedings is warranted in the circumstances of this case. However, as has been noted above, the Tribunal is willing to consider and take fully into account the views of the Ghanaian courts on the issues raised with regard to the applicability of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, to the extent that such views become available in the course of the proceedings of the Tribunal. For this purpose the Tribunal is willing to approve of an ample procedural calendar. As has been noted, the Respondent is confident that the decisions of the Ghanaian courts will not take more than nine months. To the extent that new or additional considerations relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction become available, the Parties are permitted and encouraged to put such considerations before the Tribunal at any time before the proceedings on the merits are closed. This is, of course, without prejudice to any other arguments that the Parties may wish to submit concerning the merits of the dispute.\n\n193.\n\nIn this spirit of mutual respect, even in the face of divergent views, the Tribunal would like to address three other issues. The first concerns the Respondent\u2019s arguments to the effect that the Claimant may be held in contempt of court if it proceeds with the arbitration, contrary to the injunction issued by the Ghana High Court. The Tribunal will consider any such steps as highly disruptive of the right to arbitration as embodied in the PPA and the arbitration agreement and provided for in the legislation of the Republic of Ghana. The Tribunal, therefore, urges the Respondent not to pursue this line of action.\n\n194.\n\nThe second question concerns the conservatory attachments for which the Claimant has obtained leave from the Dutch courts but that could not be implemented. The Tribunal notes the Claimant\u2019s undertakings to the Ghana High Court of 15 July 2010 to the effect that it will not seek any further conservatory attachments of any of Ghana\u2019s assets in any jurisdiction pending the final determination of the arbitration. As this undertaking has been also argued in this arbitration, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant is under an obligation not to pursue any such current or further attachments of Ghanaian assets in any jurisdiction pending the final determination of this arbitration.\n\n195.\n\nLastly the Tribunal must react to the Claimant\u2019s request for a confidentiality order to the Parties to keep confidential all awards and orders in this arbitration, as well as other materials and documents related thereto, unless agreed in writing to the contrary, save when disclosure is ordered in certain domestic court proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider that there is justification for such an order at this stage. However, it is willing to reconsider the matter if in the course of these proceedings new considerations are brought to its attention, and the issue is duly argued by the Parties.\n\n**VI. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal, having deliberated, unanimously decides:\n\n1. That it is competent to decide on the validity of the arbitration agreement concluded by the Parties.\n\n2. That the Parties are obliged to arbitrate, by virtue of Article 22.2 of the PPA, in respect of the proceedings initiated by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated 23 December 2009.\n\n3. That, accordingly, it has jurisdiction over the Parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n4. That the Claimant\u2019s request for an anti-suit injunction against the Respondent is rejected.\n\n5. That the Claimant\u2019s request for a confidentiality order is rejected."}, {"Title": "Award on the Merits", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2014-04-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award

The Respondent is represented by the Honourable Marietta Brew Appiah-Oppong, Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Attorney-General\u2019s Department, Post Office Box.

Tsikata, Ms. Ekua Hayfron-Benjamin and Ms. Zoe Phillips, Reindorf Chambers, Legal Practitioners, 20 Jones Nelson Road, P.O. Box 823, Adabraka, Accra, Ghana.\n\n**B. Background to the Dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe present dispute concerns a Power Purchase Agreement (the **\"PPA\"**) entered into by the Parties on 27 July 2007, with an effective date of 31 October 2007 (the **\"Effective Date\"**).1 Faced with a severe power shortage, in 2007, Ghana entered into negotiations with Balkan US for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Osagyefo Power Barge (the **\"Barge\"**) a one hundred and twenty-five megawatt (125MW) dual fired (diesel and gas) Power Barge and associated facilities (the **\"Power Station\"**) in Effasu in the Western Region of Ghana, which was then unused.2 Under the PPA, BEL was to commission the Barge within ninety (90) working days of the Effective Date; convertit into a combined cycle power plant by the addition of certain facilities; upgrade the capacity of the Barge; and invest in infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the Barge.3 For its part, Ghana was to ensure that all electricity necessary for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Barge was provided; facilitate the acquisition of government approvals, visas, and equipment; construct and install the transmission line required to connect to Ghana\u2019s national grid (the **\"National Grid\"**); and take and pay for all electricity thereafter generated by the Power Station.4\n\nPower Purchase Agreement Between the Government of Ghana, Acting by and through its Minister for Energy and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited on Osagyefo Power Barge and Associated Facilities Effasu Project July 2007 (\"PPA\"); Notice of Arbitration, 23 December 2009 (**\"Notice of Arbitration\"**).\n\nPPA, Preamble; Notice of Arbitration, paras. 24-25; Respondent\u2019s Brief Regarding Procedural Order No. 1,14 September 2010 (**\"Respondent\u2019s Brief\"**), at 3.\n\nPPA, Preamble, at 1; PPA, paras. 2.1-2.4; PPA, First Schedule.\n\nPPA paras, 2,5-2.10, 3.3.\n\n4.\n\nEach Party alleges that the other has failed to perform its obligations under the PPA, The Claimant contends that the Respondent has Jailed to provide adequate site electricity;5 failed to provide a connection to the National Grid through a proper transmission line;6 and failed to comply with its obligation to facilitate the acquisition and installation of a piece of equipment, known as a Remote Terminal Unit (the **\"RTU\"**), on the Barge.7 The Claimant further contends f that, under Clause 11.9 of the PPA, it is owed tolling fees (**\"Tolling Fees\"**) since 28 October 2008, the date on which it alleges that the Power Station would have been completed but for the: ; Respondent\u2019s failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection facilities.8 The Tolling Tees are meant not only to cover the cost of electricity but also remunerate the Claimant for its investments. The Claimant states that it has, since 25 November 2008, sent the Respondent invoices totaling over USD 50 million in respect of Tolling Fees.9\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 45-48.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 49-57.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 58-60,\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras.61-69.\n\nPPA, paras. 65, 79.3; Notice of Arbitration, Exhibits 23 (invoice of 25 November 2008), 24 (twelve monthly invoices, from 25 November 2008).\n\n5.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent contends that, it has fulfilled its obligations, and that the Power Station has never been operational because of breaches of the PPA by the Claimant.10 The Respondent asserts that none of the arguments raised by the Claimant justifies the Claimant\u2019s failure to complete the commissioning of the Barge.11 By letter dated 28 August 2009, Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Energy stated that Ghana had provided BEL with grid connectivity via the transmission line and interconnection facilities, and asserted that the fact that the Power Station was not operational was due to BEL\u2019s own inability to complete the facilities.12 The Respondent also claims that the upgrading of certain necessary equipment on the Barge was not undertaken by BEL. Relying on statements made by BEL and document production in a lawsuit filed in a United States District Court against a subcontractor on the Barge (ProEnergy Services LLC), the Respondent describes the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Barge was operational as fraudulent.13 The Respondent also disputes the Claimant\u2019s invoices for Tolling Fees referred to above.14\n\n*See* e.g., Respondent\u2019s Brief at 4-5.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 74.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 3..\n\nRespondent\u2019s Brief, at 4-5; Rejoinder, para. 4.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, Exhibit 25.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing challenges raised by the Respondent to the validity of the arbitration clause (the **\"Arbitration Agreement\"**) in the PPA, and generally to the arbitrability of the dispute, the Tribunal issued an interim award on jurisdiction (the **\"Interim Award\"**) on 22 December 2010, in which it affirmed its competence to decide the present dispute.\n\n7.\n\nThe central issue before the Tribunal in this merits phase of the arbitration is whether the Claimant achieved the \"milestone events\" set forth in the Third Schedule of the PPA (most notably, testing and commissioning of the Power Station within ninety (90) working days of the Effective Date) or, in the alternative, whether the Claimant has demonstrated that it is entitled to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA or any other form of damages. The Tribunal must also decide on the Respondent\u2019s counterclaims for breach of contract.15\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 169-182.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 23 December 2009, the Claimant commenced arbitration against the Respondent pursuant to Article 22.2 of the PPA and Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the **\"UNCITRAL Rules\"**). Under the PPA, the dispute shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ghana.\n\n9.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebei as the first arbitrator and, on 12 March 2010, the Respondent appointed Judge Thomas A. Mensah as the second arbitrator. On 1 April 2010, the Co-arbitrators selected Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a as ; the President of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Interim Award of 22 December 2010 recounts in detail the procedural history of the arbitration from its commencement up until the date that Award was issued. The Tribunal will therefore principally focus on developments since December 2010.\n\n11.\n\nShortly after the issuance of the Interim Award, the Tribunal fixed the schedule for the filing of the Parties\u2019 written pleadings on the merits as follows: 15 July 201.1 for the Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim, 15 January 2012 for the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Defense, 15 April 2012 for the Claimant\u2019s Reply, and 15 July 20.12 for the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n12.\n\nOn 22 June 2011, the Claimant notified the Tribunal and the PCA that if had retained Mr. Mitchell Madden to act as co-counsel and requested an extension of \"no more than 180 days and no less than 120 days\" to submit its Statement of Claim, By letters dated 23 and 27 June 2011, the Respondent advised that it had no objection to the requested extension, provided that the remaining dates fixed by the Tribunal were also adjusted to reflect the prior symmetry in each Party\u2019s respective deadlines.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 June 20.11, the Tribunal granted a 90-day extension for the submission of the Statement of Claim and amended the schedule for filing of the Parties\u2019 written pleadings on the merits as follows;.12 October 2011 for the Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim, 12 April 2012 for the Respondent's Statement of Defense, 12 July 2012 for the Claimant\u2019s Reply, and 12 October 2012 for the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n14.\n\nOn 17 October 2011, the Claimant submitted a part of its Statement of Claim, with supporting materials to follow the next day. Claimant\u2019s counsel explained that the transmission of the Statement of Claim \"was delayed in material part, due to an apparent misapprehension [he] had with respect to settlement negotiations that were (unbeknownst to [him] until late Friday, Dallas time) scheduled to occur in Dallas, Texas on Monday October 17, 2011\", and which were subsequently cancelled.\n\n15.\n\nOn 18 October 2011, the Tribunal confirmed electronic receipt of the Statement of Claim and reaffirmed that the Respondent was to submit its Statement of Defense on 12 April 2012.\n\n16.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal advising that it had not yet received the exhibits and supporting materials referenced in the Statement of Claim and that the \"information which came to [Claimant\u2019s] counsel\u2019s attention \u2018late Friday, Dallas time\u2019 - would have been after the Statement of Claim was due to be filed\" on 32 October 2011. The Respondent did not object to \"the late and/or incomplete filing\", but requested that the Tribunal \"grant the Government a similar grace period, should it become necessary, measured from the date on which the Government receives Balkan\u2019s fully submitted Statement of Claim with supporting documents\". On 19 October 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was open to granting a limited extension along the lines envisaged in the Respondent\u2019s letter, if such an extension became necessary. The Tribunal also instructed the Claimant to proceed without delay in the event that its full Statement of Claim had not yet been transmitted electronically and by courier to the Respondent\u2019s counsel.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 October 2011, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Statement of Claim (the **\"Statement of Claim\"**). Since the Claimant had made arrangements with a courier service for its delivery to Respondent\u2019s counsel on 19 October 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would use 19 October 2011 as the date for calculating any \"grace period\" to be afforded to the Respondent to submit its Statement of Defense, should it become necessary. The Tribunal also reminded the Claimant of its duty, pursuant to Section 2.1.2 of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, dated 27 July 201.0, to provide the Tribunal, the opposing Party and the Registry with hard copies of ail exhibits and attachments.\n\n18.\n\nOn 9 February 2012, the Claimant provided hard copies of all of the exhibits referenced in its Statement of Claim..\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 13 March 2012. the Respondent requested that Paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 2 be modified to allow for early document disclosure of certain technical documents prior to the submission of its Statement of Defense.\n\n20.\n\nOn 14 March, the Tribunal invited the Claimant\u2019s comments on the Respondent\u2019s proposal for early document production by 20 March 2012,\n\n21.\n\nBy e-mail dated 20 March 2012, the Claimant notified the Tribunal of its objection to the Respondent\u2019s request for early document disclosure and requested an extension until 23 March 2012 in which to provide a formal response. By e-mail dated 21 March 2012, the Tribunal granted the Claimant\u2019s extension request-\n\n22.\n\nOn 23 March 2012, the Claimant submitted its formal objection to the Respondent\u2019s request of 13 March 2012, \"based upon the inequal process that the requested modification to the scheduling order would occasion to [sic] and because the Government\u2019s request and the argument in support of its request, demonstrate the reasonableness and underlying rational of. the procedure as outlined in Section 4.1 of the order\". On 26 March 2012, the Respondent countered that there was no issue of fairness or unequal treatment, and reiterated its request that the Tribunal modify Procedural Order No, 2 so as to permit targeted discovery before Ghana was required to submit its Statement of Defense.\n\n23.\n\nOn 27 March 2012, upon careful consideration of the Parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal decided to maintain the schedule as provided in Paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 2 and ruled that both Parties would \"have the opportunity to request production of any documents no later than 15 days after the submission of the Statement of Defense.\"\n\n24.\n\nOn 9 April 2012, the Respondent requested an additional one-week extension, until 26 April 2012, in which to file its Statement of Defense due to the Easter holiday.\n\n25.\n\nThe next day, the Claimant advised that it had no objection to the requested extension.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 10 April 2012, the Tribunal granted the one week extension, thereby amending the schedule for the filing of the Parties' written pleadings on the merits as follows: 26 April 2012 for the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Defense, 26 July 2012 for the Claimant\u2019s Reply, and 26 October 2012 for the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n27.\n\nOn 26 April 2012, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defense (the **\"Statement of Defense\"**).\n\n28.\n\nOn 10 May 2012, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request that it fix a date by which Ghana should make its request to the Claimant for the production of documents pursuant to Paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 2. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal directed the Parties to make any requests for production of documents from the other Party by 18 May 2012.\n\n29.\n\nBy e-mail of the same date, the Respondent requested a thirty-day adjournment to the document production timetable on account of the dissolution of its lead counsel\u2019s firm. On 15 May 2012, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to express its consent to the requested extension.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated 16 May 2012, the Tribunal advised the Parties to exchange any document production requests they may have on 18 June 2012. To accommodate the new timetable for document production, the Tribunal further advised that the calendar for the Parties\u2019 remaining substantive submissions would be revised as follows: 6 September 2012 for the Claimant\u2019s Reply and 5 December 2012 for the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n31.\n\nOn 23 May 2012, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the Supreme Court of Ghana\u2019s decision in the *Attorney General* v. *Balkan Energy Ghana et al.* matter rendered on 16 May 2012 (the **\"Supreme Court Judgment\"**), and inquired whether the Tribunal wished to receive the Parties' respective views on the impact of the Judgment on the present arbitration. On 25 May 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to offer any comments they wished to make on the Judgment, by simultaneous submission on 8 June 2012,\n\n32.\n\nBy letter dated 30 May 2012, the Tribunal proposed to hold the hearing on the merits from 24 to 30 April 2013 at the Peace Palace in The Hague.\n\n33.\n\nOn 1 June 2012, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension until 20 June 2012 to submit comments on the Supreme Court Judgment, in order to allow it time to request a review of the decision from the Ghana Supreme Court. On 4 June 2012, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant\u2019s request by 6 June 2012. On 6 June 2012, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, agreeing to the Claimant\u2019s extension request and additionally requesting a different schedule for the subsequent proceedings in the event that the Claimant decided to make an application before the Ghana Supreme Court to review the Supreme Court Judgment.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 8 June 2012, the Tribunal approved the Claimant\u2019s requested extension and directed the Parties to simultaneously submit their views, or communicate that they had no comments on the matter at this stage, on 20 June 2012. The Tribunal further noted that it did\n\nnot intend to take a decision on the implications of this Judgment (or any subsequent decisions that may be issued) until after the hearing on the merits. Consequently the Respondent\u2019s request to open up a period for comments, reply and rejoinder, and attach to it a different schedule depending on whether further submissions are made to the Ghana Supreme Court, does not meet with the Tribunal\u2019s approval at this stage.\n\nThe Tribunal also ruled that the Parties were free to submit additional comments on the matter in the scheduled Reply and Rejoinder submissions.\n\n35.\n\nHaving consulted with the Parties, by letter dated 13 June 2012, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would be held on 24 to 30 April 2013, with 1 and 2 May 2013 held in reserve in the event that additional time is required. The Tribunal also confirmed that, in view of the earlier agreement between the Parties, the hearing would be held in London.\n\n36.\n\nOn 14 June 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of its wish to place on the record that, while it had no objection to holding the merits hearing in London as directed by the Tribunal in its 13 June correspondence, choosing London as a hearing venue should not affect the Parties agreement that The Hague, the Netherlands be the place of arbitration.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter dated 18 June 2012. the Tribunal noted that, pursuant to Article 3 6 of the UNCITRAL Rules which governs this proceeding, the establishment of an arbitral seat does not preclude the A Tribunal or the Parties from holding hearing or meetings in another location. Recalling Articles 6.1 and 6.3 of the Terms of Appointment, which restate an agreement reached by the Parties and communicated to the Tribunal in a letter dated 8 June 2010, the Tribunal confirmed \"that The if Hague is the place of arbitration (seat) for the present proceedings, whereas London shall be the place at which the hearings will be held\".\n\n38.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant submitted its Request for Production of Documents to the Respondent.\n\n39.\n\nOn ]9 June 2012, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s 8 June 2012 letter, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would present its arguments with respect to the effect of the Supreme Court Judgment in its Rejoinder. The Respondent further noted \"that the Claimant apparently chose not to seek review of the Supreme Court Judgment, and that the 30 day period provided in the Rules for filing such an application has now lapsed\". On the same date, the Claimant submitted its Interim Submission with respect to the Supreme Court Judgment (the **\"Interim Submission\"**).\n\n40.\n\nBy letter dated 21 June 2012, the Tribunal reiterated that it would \"not take a decision on the implications on the Supreme Court Judgment (or any subsequent decisions that may be issued) until after the hearing on the merits at which time it [would] take into consideration the Parties\u2019 views on the matter\", including those expressed by the Parties in their respective letters dated 20 June 2012 and any additional views expressed in the Pasties\u2019 forthcoming substantive submissions.\n\n41.\n\nOn 6 September 2012, the Claimant submitted its Reply to the Statement of Defense (the **\"Reply\"**).\n\n42.\n\nOn 8 November 2012, with the consent of the Claimant, the Respondent requested a two-week extension, 20 December 2012, to file its Rejoinder' due to the hurricane that hit the northeast coast of the United States. By letter dated 9 November 2012, the Tribunal granted the requested extension. On 20 December 2012, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Rejoinder (the **\"Rejoinder\"**).\n\n43.\n\nOn 28 January 203 3, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it wished to hold a Procedural Conference with the Parties by telephone on 7 February 2013, the results of which would be recorded in a Procedural Order No. 3. To that end, the Tribunal circulated a draft of Procedural Order No. 3 for the Parties\u2019 advance review. On 7 February 2013, the Parties and the Tribunal participated in a procedural teleconference. On 12 February 2013, upon consideration of the Parties\u2019 comments and discussions at the procedural teleconference, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter dated 4 March 2013, the Claimant requested that Section 2 of Procedural Order No. 3. as well as the order of the Tribunal dated 16 May 2012, be modified to allow it to submit a rebuttal expert opinion from a new expert witness. The Claimant also requested that it be able to reserve the right to request further document production from the Respondent, On 5, 12 and 14 March 2013, the Respondent contested the Claimant\u2019s requests.\n\n45.\n\nBy letter dated 18 March 2013, the Tribunal denied the Claimant\u2019s application for leave to file a rebuttal expert report. The Tribunal concluded \"that the procedural calendar has provided the Parties with ample time to gather and file any evidence in support of their case, and [that] the submission of a further expert report at this stage would risk jeopardizing the Parties\u2019 and the Tribunal\u2019s orderly preparation for the hearing,\" The Tribunal also noted that, pursuant to Section 3.4 of Procedural Order No. 3, it looked forward to receiving a joint scheduling proposal from the Parties, including their views on the order and grouping of witnesses and experts, by 25 March 2013, To assist the Parties in their consultations, the Tribunal identified in general terms, in an Annex to this letter, the topics on which it wished to hear testimony of witnesses and experts at the hearing. The Tribunal requested that the Parties attempt: to group testimony on related topics, though it acknowledges that it might not be feasible to maintain a strict grouping by topics in respect of all witnesses/experts. Finally, the Tribunal took note of the Claimant\u2019s indication that it might wish to request the production of further documents in the possession of the Respondent and that, if required, the Tribunal would be prepared to decide any such application by the Claimant after appropriate consultation of the Respondent.\n\n46.\n\nOn 21 March 2013, the Claimant requested the Tribunal\u2019s assistance in relation to the preparation of an agreed Chronology of Facts, attaching its draft Chronology of Facts as provided to the Respondent. On the same date, recalling its direction in Section 2.1 of Procedural Order No; 3 - that the Parties \"endeavor to produce an agreed Chronology of Facts, to be filed with the Tribunal by March 25, 2013\", with any differences on certain facts indicated in the same document - the Tribunal advised the Parties that it would be best assisted by a 3-5 page document that lists, in a tabular form and in chronological order, the major material events underlying the present arbitration.\n\n47.\n\nOn 22 March 2013, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal disregard the Claimant\u2019s draft Chronology of Facts, and that it should not constitute part of the record, since it was not a joint submission, as required by Section 2.1 of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n48.\n\nOn 26 March 2013, the Claimant requested that the due date for the agreed Chronology of Facts be postponed until 26 March 2013.\n\n49.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not have regard to the Claimant\u2019s draft Chronology, which it understood had been attached to the Claimant\u2019s 2.1 March 2013 letter for purely illustrative purposes.\n\n50.\n\nBy letter dated 3 April 2013, the Respondent submitted an amended version of Mr. Watson\u2019s expert report stating that Mr, Watson was able to \"be more specific regarding a statement contained in \u00b6 5.22 of his opinion based upon his recent trip to Ghana\".\n\n51.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant notified the Tribunal and the Respondent of the new address of its counsel and requested, with the consent of the Respondent, an extension of time for the. submission of an agreed scheduling proposal,\n\n52.\n\nOn 5 April 2013, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties might submit their agreed scheduling proposal pursuant to Section 3.4 of Procedural Order No. 3, as well as any other information that was to be provided by 3 April 2013 pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3, by 8 April 2013.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter dated 8 April 20.13, the Respondent informed the Tribunal about the results of the Parties\u2019 consultations pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3, attaching a proposed schedule of witnesses and experts for the hearing and advising that it would be necessary and appropriate to make provision for Post-Hearing Memorials. The Claimant proposed that the Parties simultaneously submit Post-Hearing Memorials on 17 June 2013, followed by simultaneous Replies on 2 July 2013. The Respondent, however, proposed that there be only one round of Post-Hearing Memorials, and suggested that the Claimant file its Memorial by 3 June 2013, with the Respondent\u2019s Memorial to follow by 2 July 2013.\n\n54.\n\nOn 12 April 2013, the Tribunal confirmed the hearing arrangements regarding hearing bundles and the schedule of proceedings. The Tribunal further noted that at the hearing it would discuss with the Parties \"(a) the amount of time to be allocated to each witness and (b) the modalities for the submission of Post-Hearing Briefs.\"\n\n55.\n\nBy letter dated 17 April 2013, the Respondent submitted its list of attendees for the upcoming bearing. On the same date, the Claimant transmitted its list of hearing attendees.\n\n56.\n\nOn 19 April, the Claimant submitted its core hearing bundle, pursuant to the Tribunal's direction in its 12 April 2013 letter.\n\n57.\n\nOn 22 April 2013, the Claimant supplemented its list of attendees, informing that counsel for ProEnergy would attend the examination of Mr. John Bryant.\n\n58.\n\nOn 23 April 2013, the Claimant submitted additional calculations of Tolling Fees, in which it sought to draw a distinction between the period leading up to 1 January 2014 and the period thereafter. Some elements in the additional calculations, such as the discount rate, appeared to be new or different, but the bulk of the additional calculations appeared to be an elaboration on calculations that, the Claimant had previously filed as evidence.\n\n59.\n\nThe Hearing on the Merits was held on 24 April to 2 May 2013 in London. Present at the Hearing were:\n\n**The Tribunal**\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a   \nJudge Stephen M. Schwebel   \nJudge Thomas A.

Finally, the Tribunal directed that each Party submit a post-hearing submission, not exceeding 50 pages, by 31 July 2013. The Tribunal emphasized that \"[n]o new' evidence shall be admissible at this stage.\"\n\n61.\n\nOn 21 May 2013, upon the request of the Parties, the PCA made the audio recordings of the hearing in London available to the Parties.\n\n62.\n\nBy letter dated 23 May 2013, the Respondent requested, with the Claimant\u2019s consent, \"an extension to 4 June 2013 for the submission of errata designations to the Tribunal\", and informed that the Parties had \"agreed to consult with each other on 3 June 2013 concerning their errata designation in advance of the submission of same to the Tribunal and the PCA\".\n\n63.\n\nOn 24 May 2013, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request for an extension of time to file its corrections to the transcript.\n\n64.\n\nBy letter dated 30 May 2013, the Claimant requested, with the Respondent\u2019s consent, an extension to 7 June 2013 in which to submit the additional information the Tribunal had requested by 31 May 2013 in its 7 May 2013 letter.

The Respondent went on to assert that the, Claimant\u2019s 7 June Letter \"adopted an entirely different system for identifying those same documents, which hinders the ability to properly analyze Balkan\u2019s response to the Tribunal\".

The Respondent requested \"that the Tribunal strike A the documents... and direct that they not constitute part of the record of these proceedings\", and that \"the Tribunal disregard and or strike evidence from this documents that is cited in. Balkan\u2019s Post-Hearing Closing Brief... and that it order such other and further relief as the. Tribunal deems appropriate in the light of Balkan\u2019s knowing violation of its Orders\".

First, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimant\u2019s request for the production of the Information Paper was denied. The Tribunal recalled that it had \"made it clear that it is not willing to admit any new evidence after (he hearing\". The Tribunal stated that \"[t]he same principle holds true, *a fortiori,* for evidence requested to be adduced after the Parties have submitted their post-hearing submissions. Admitting any such evidence into the record would be inconsistent with the orderly conduct of the arbitral proceedings and would compromise the right of defense of the opposing Party.\"\n\nSecond, the Tribunal decided not to take into consideration any new evidence pertaining to damages that was submitted with the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, The Tribunal reiterated its ruling on the non-admissibility of new evidence and observed that \"the Claimant had ample opportunity to provide evidence in support of its damages calculation during the course of the arbitration. Admitting such documents into the record would compromise the right of defense of the opposing party.\"\n\nThird, the Tribunal decided to \"consider the information provided by the Claimant in its June 7, 2013 submission [Claimant's 7 June Letter]\" relating to its corporate structure, as had been specifically requested by the Tribunal on 7 May 2013, but that it would not \"have regard to any new evidence adduced with the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission\". According to the Tribunal, \"such information was to be provided in a separate stage, well in advance of the posthearing submissions, so as to enable the opposing Party to comment on such information and draw out its legal significance in its post-hearing submission.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, \"adherence to this process is essential to uphold the right of defense of the opposing Party.\"\n\n80.\n\nBy letter dated 8 October 2013, the Tribunal noted that there were several incorrect crossreferences in paragraph 152 of the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission. The Tribunal requested the Claimant \"to provide the appropriate cross-references as a point of formal correction.\" The Tribunal stressed that \"no further changes to the Post-Hearing Brief will be allowed or taken into consideration.\" By letter dated 10 October 2013, the Claimant provided the formal corrections requested by the Tribunal.\n\n**III.

(the **\"Stanbic Bank\"**).115\n\nStatement of Facts, para, 139\n\n111.\n\nOn 26 October 2007, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Ghana, the Honourable Joseph Ghatey, issued two legal opinions. The first opinion stated:\n\nAfter examining the attached documents we are satisfied that...\n\n... the power producer, Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited (BE[L]) is a locally incorporated company and as a result the PPA does not come under the ambit of Article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution which stipulates that an international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party should be submitted to Parliament for approval. In the Supreme Court case of Attorney General versus Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd. (2005-2006)....... the Supreme Court held that international business or economic transaction means international business or international economic transaction. This clearly excludes the project hereof which involves a local company in a local transaction with the Government. :\n\nIn light of the above a Parliamentary approval would not be required for the effectiveness of the Agreement.116.\n\nThe second legal opinion stated:\n\nI have examined executed copies of the [PPA and Project Site Lease (**\"Project. Agreements\"**)] and such other documents as I have considered necessary or desirable to examine in order that I may give this opinion....\n\nI am of the opinion that:\n\n(i) [Ghana] has the power to enter into the Project Agreements and to exercise its rights and perform its obligations there under, and execution of the Project Agreements on behalf of [Ghana] by the person(s) who executed the Project Agreements was duly authorised;\n\n(ii) all acts, conditions and things required by the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana to be done, fulfilled and performed in order (a) to enable [Ghana] lawfully to enter into, exercise its rights under and perform the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in the Project Agreements, (b) to ensure that the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in the Project Agreements are valid and enforceable by appropriate proceedings and (c) to make the Project Agreements admissible in evidence in the Republic of Ghana, have been done, fulfilled and performed in compliance with the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana;\n\n(iii) The obligations of [Ghana] under the Project Agreements are legal and valid obligations binding on [Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreements;\n\n(iv) [Ghana] is not entitled under the terms of the Project Agreements to claim any immunity from sait, execution, attachment or other Segal process in the Republic of Ghana and such waiver is legal and binding on [Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Project Agreements; and\n\n(v) The sanctity of contract is recognised under the laws of Ghana and consequently the validity of the Project Agreements and the binding nature of the obligations of the parties there under are constitutionally safeguarded.117\n\nOperationalising the Osagyefo Barge, Legal Opinion by the Attorney-General, 26 October 2007 (Notice of Arbitration, Exhibit 8).\n\nLegal Opinion, Power Purchase Agreement Between the Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited, 26 October 2007 (Notice of Arbitration, Exhibit 8).\n\n112.\n\nOn 30 October 2007, Ghana\u2019s Minister for Energy, Mr. Adda, noted in a communication to Mr. Elders that, as per the conditions precedent in Article 7 of the PPA, Ghana had; issued a legal opinion as to the validity, enforceability and binding effect of the PPA; issued to BEL a standby letter of credit, as required by Article 11.7; and provided BEL with construction power at the Project Site. Mr. Adda also acknowledged that BEL had submitted to Ghana; copies of BEL\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, Certificate to Commence Business, and Regulations of BEL; copies of resolutions adopted by BEL\u2019s Board of Directors authorizing the execution, delivery and performance by BEL of the PPA; and copies of a resolution adopted by BEL shareholders authorizing the execution, delivery and performance by BEL of the PPA, certified by the BEL Secretary.\n\n113.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Effective Date of the PPA was 31 October 2007.118\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 142; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 94; \"MOE letter affixing Effective Date\"; Statement of Defense, para. 37.\n\n114.\n\nUnder the PPA, the Parties agreed that, whereas Ghana had an urgent need for additional electricity generation to meet its power supply deficiencies, BEL, bearing all costs, estimated at USD 40 million, would lease the Power Station from Ghana, and commission it. In particular, pursuant to the PPA and the Milestone Schedule attached as the Third Schedule to the PPA, BEL was obligated to have the Power Station ready for \"Final Testing and Commissioning\" - meaning ready for commercial operation - as a one hundred and twenty-five megawatt (125 MW) Power Station within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date of the PPA.119\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 37.\n\n115.\n\nThe Parties further agreed that BEL, bearing all costs, estimated at USD 100 million, would convert the Power Station into a combined cycle power plant by the addition of a heat recovery steam generator with an incremental capacity of approximately sixty megawatts (60MW). a steam turbine, an electric generator and associated facilities within nine (9) months of the Effective Date of the P.PA; that BEL, at an estimated cost of USD 250 to 300 million, would privately invest and bring two more combined cycle barge mounted systems, with capacity of approximately one hundred and eight-five megawatts (185 MW) each, to the site within thirty-six (36) months of agreement on a tolling fee for the systems; that BEL would, subject to satisfactory conclusion of supply agreements with other source providers and at an estimated cost of US'D 100 million, invest in infrastructure to enable natural gas to be supplied to the Power Station within three (3) years of the Effective Date of the PPA; and that BEL would provide all fuel to the Project at cost.120\n\nPPA, Preamble; paras 2.1-2.4; First Schedule.\n\n116.\n\nUnder the PPA. the Parties also agreed that Ghana would ensure that all necessary site electricity was provided, at BEL\u2019s cost, and made available as reasonably required by BEL; that Ghana would promptly facilitate the acquisition of governmental approvals for the duty-free importation and transportation of equipment to the site, for operating permits, licenses and approvals for the project, and for visas and work permits for foreign personnel and for full compliance with all local and other regulations; that Ghana thereby guaranteed that BEL would have the exclusive right to generate electricity from the site subject to meeting the agreed timetable; that Ghana would facilitate the acquisition of all governmental approvals required for the leasing, equipping and operation of the Power Station, including relevant environmental permits from the Environmental Protection Agency; that Ghana would construct, install and connect the transmission line and relay protection equipment necessary to connect the Power Station to the National Grid, except that BEL would be responsible, at its own cost, for provision of adequate transmission cables to the point of interconnection with Ghana\u2019s national electricity grid; that Ghana would take and pay for all electricity generated by the Power Station during the term of the Agreement.121\n\nPPA, paras. 2.5-2.9, 3.3.\n\n117.\n\nUnder the PPA, the Parties also agreed that they would mutually collaborate with each other in order to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance by each Party of its obligations (a process referred to as \"dovetailing\" by the Claimant), and that Ghana would provide full and timely cooperation in connection with BEL\u2019s efforts to finance the Power Station on a non-recourse, project finance basis, including, without limitation, responding to all requests for information on and certification of Ghana\u2019s authority and the status of the PPA.122\n\nPPA, para. 2.10.\n\n118.\n\nThe PPA further provides that, should BEL be unable to commence testing of the Power Station as a result of Ghana\u2019s failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection facilities for the Power Station, Ghana would be obligated to commence paying Tolling Fees to BEL on the thirtieth day after BEL certified to Ghana that the Power Station was complete or would have been complete except for Ghana\u2019s non-performance.123\n\nPPA, para. 11.9.\n\n**2. Disputed Facts**\n---------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that after submitting its Proposal, Mr. Elders immediately sensed \"some reluctance on the part of the [Ministry of Energy] to hammer out an agreement\", followed by \"many unnecessary delays\".124 The Claimant further states that the Ansaldo representatives \"indicated to Elders that if he were able to negotiate a PPA it would \u2018be a miracle\u2019.\"125\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 75.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 77; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 42.\n\n120.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the \"incorporation of BE[L] Ghana had at that time nothing whatsoever to do with issues of the Ghanaian [C]onstitution or parliamentary approval but were motivated entirely by Mr. KK Sey\u2019s correct observation that in order to become licensed pursuant to the applicable laws of Ghana governing power generation and transmission it was necessary' to have a license and that the statutes of Ghana required that that license might only be obtained through a Ghanaian entity.\"126 According to the Claimant BEL obtained the license on 1 October 2007.127\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 92; *see also* Exhibit C-4: \"Ghana investment Promotion Centre Act. 1994 (Act 478)\".\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 92, fn. 23.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Mr. Elders \"does not recall being informed of having negotiations with respect to potential constitutional requirements of parliamentary approval.\"128 The Claimant further asserts that the Ministry of Energy was fully aware of Balkan US\u2019s interest in BEL and the reasons for the incorporation of BEL in Ghana, and corresponding \u201ffinal vesting of the PPA in that entity\".129\n\nStatement o\u00ed\u2019 Claim, para. 94.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 94.\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that throughout the Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim, it \"repeatedly casts. aspersions upon the officials conducting the negotiations [of the PPA), implying or inferring some hidden motive that delayed the negotiations.\"130 The Respondent denies these allegations. It asserts that \"what separated the parties were the economics of Balkan\u2019s proposal, not the hidden motives of government officials.\"131\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 30.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 30; Witness Statement of Vivienne Gadzekpo, para. 10.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent contends that none of the Claimant\u2019s representations in the MOU turned out to be true. First, the Claimant represented that it was a private corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands; however, it later came to light that the Claimant is not in fact registered in the Netherlands. Second, the Claimant stated that it had \"the experience and capability of operating liqutd/gas fired power plants\"; however, the Claimant did not have the experience and capability it claimed, particularly with respect to commissioning the turbines.132\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 35; Exhibit R-7: \"Deposition of Phillip Elders, *ProEnergy Services, LLC v. Balkan Energy Co.,* No. 09-4026.\"\n\n**B. Description of the power Station /****Barge**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the detailed technical descriptions of the Power Station and Barge as provided by the Parties. These descriptions have been the subject of much discussion during this merits phase of the arbitration. The Tribunal will now address the technical aspects of the commissioning process\u2014particularly those that are in dispute between the Parties\u2014to the extent necessary for the present Award,\n\n125.\n\nThe Power Station is mounted on the Barge, which is located in a large man-made pond in a remote area of Ghana\u2019s western region.133 Approximately 50 meters from the pond is **\"Tower No. 1\"** of the spur grid that connects the Power Station to the two substations in the near-by villages of Essiama and Elubo, namely, the \"Essiama Transmission Line\" and the **\"Elubo Transmission Line\"**, (collectively referred to as the **\"Transmission Lines\"**).134\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 101, fn. 25; *see* Exhibit C-38, Attachments 69-86 for photographs of the Barge and Power Station; *see* Exhibit C-38, Attachment 76 for aerial photographs of the Barge site; *see esp.* Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, at 4, for basic diagram of the primary facilities on the Barge.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 102.\n\n126.\n\nBuilt by Ansaldo, the Power Station consists of two V.64.3A turbines (**\"Turbine 1\"** and **\"Turbine 2\"**, collectively the **\"Turbines\"**), each with its own generator,135 together with a control substation (the **\"Substation\"**).136 The Turbines and generators produce power at eleven, kilovolts (11 kV), which is then \u2018stepped-up\u2019 to one hundred and sixty-one kilovolts (161 kV) by the transformers on the Substation.137\n\nThe Respondent often refers to the Turbines and the generators collectively as the \"turbine-generators\".\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 103; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 70.\n\nExpert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para, 4.1(b).\n\n127.\n\nThe Remote Terminal Unit (the **\"RTU\"**) is a piece of equipment on the Barge whose primary function is to transmit data to and from the Micro Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (the **\"MicroSCADA\"**) installed on the Barge. The RTU, MicroSCADA and the Distribution Control System (the **\"DCS\"**) permit an operator in the control room on the Barge to monitor and control equipment in the Substation.138\n\nWitness Statement of Vivienne Gadzekpo, para. 28, citing the witness statements of Emmanuel Osafo and Eric Asare; Statement of Claim, para. 115.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Ghana's National Interconnected Transmission System (the **\"G-NITS\"**) is operated at one hundred and sixty-one kilovolts (161 kV) (the Tribunal assumes that the term G-NITS used by the Claimant is the same as the 161 kV electrical system referred to by the Respondent).139 The normal unit operator start-up for the Barge requires that both the G-NITS and the Substation be energized to 161 kV, which subsequently energizes the 161 kV transformers to bring power so both the open generator breaker and the auxiliary transformer.140\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 104; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 71.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 106; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 73.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that final commissioning cannot be achieved without the final connection to the G-NITS \"because it is the source of power to start the combustion turbine, and also the source of load to test the turbine during performance testing activities\".141\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 113; Exhibit C-38; Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para, 80.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Substation is equipped with, *inter alia,* a one hundred and sixty-one kilovolt (161 kV) electrical system, which includes the gantry, the 161 kV GIS switchgear, two main 161/13 kV \u2018step-up\u2019 transformers, the earlhing/grounding system and the protection relays.142 The function of the 161 kV electrical system is to take power generated from the power-generation equipment located on the Barge (including the Turbines and generator) and, in a controlled manner, allow that power to pass onto the Transmission Lines connected to the Barge at the gantry.143 The 161 kV GIS switchgear controls both the export of electricity out to the Transmission Line and the import of energy, if any is required, from the Transmission Lines to the Barge,144\n\nRejoinder, para. 58, referring to Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para. 4.1(b).\n\nRejoinder, para. 58, referring to Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para. 5.7.\n\nRejoinder, para. 58, fn. 24, referring to Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para, 4.1(b).\n\n131.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the 161 kV electrical system must be fully commissioned and properly functioning before the Power Station can be connected to the National Grid. If it is not, the transformers and the 16] kV GIS switchgear could face severe damage when fired up.145\n\nRejoinder, para. 59, referring to Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para. 5.6.\n\n**C. The Commissioning Process**\n--------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, in order to fully commission the Barge under the PPA, four major \"milestones\" had to be achieved: (a) turning gear; (b) first fire; (c) full speed no load; and (d) full speed full load.146 The Claimant submits that \"the total power plant commissioning process involves commissioning multiple minor and major systems to reach each major milestone,\" as well as synchronizing each system through the DCS,147 To explain its position, the Claimant adopts the description of the commissioning phases provided by Mr, Elders in his witness statement. In further support for its version of the commissioning process, the Claimant makes reference to the witness statements of Messrs. Robert MacDonald and Lonnie Peters.148\n\nStatement of Claim, para..100.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 116.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 116; Exhibit C-39: Witness Statement of Robert MacDonald, paras. 7-9; Exhibit C-54: Supplemental Witness Statement of Robert MacDonald, paras. 72-83; Exhibit C-40: Witness Statement of Lonnie Peters, paras. 6 et seq.; Exhibit C-56: Supplemental Witness Statement of Lonnie Peters, paras. 3 et seq.\n\n133.\n\nTo explain its position, the Respondent makes reference to the witness statement of Mr. Robert Badger,149 the Commissioning Book for the Tema Thermal Power Project150 (both of which were submitted with its Statement of Defense) and the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff (submitted with its Rejoinder).151 Pursuant to the witness statement of Mr, Badger, the five necessary steps to commission the Turbines are: (a) pre-commissioning checks and tests; (b) mechanical testing of the turbine-generator to full speed no load; (c) electrical testing o\u00ed' the generator to full speed full load; (d) turbine-generator performance testing; and (e) declaration of the commercial operation date. While not expressly incorporated into the Rejoinder itself, the Tribunal has reviewed the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, according to which the commissioning of a barge requires the completion of eight steps, described in further detail below.152\n\nWitness Statement of Robert Badger, paras. 8 et seq.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 73, referring to Exhibit R-37: \"GE Energy, Tema Thermal 1 Power Project, Commissioning Book\", dated 2 March 2007.\n\nExpert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff.\n\nExpert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, at 6-8, para. 4.3(a)(i)-(viii).\n\n134.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant objects to the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the commissioning process as set out in Mr, Badger's witness statement. The Claimant asserts that \"Mr. Badger's examples of the standard of conduct between an owner and a contractor with regard to commissioning of a thermal power plant are inapplicable to the relationship between BE[L] and the [Respondent] under the PPA\" because \"BE[L] was under no obligation and the [Respondent] had no right to participate in the recommissioning process, utilizing [Mr. Badger\u2019s] steps, through final mechanical testing at [FSNL].\"153\n\nReply, paras. 102-103.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) Milestone I; Turning Gear**\n---------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the first milestone, \"Turning Gear\", entails getting the Turbines to turn very slowly, at approximately one hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty rotations per minute (130-150 RPM) to test if they are working mechanically.154 The purpose of this step is to allow the Turbine blades to cool down slowly, so as to \"avoid warping, after they have been soaked at full speed\"155The cooling process can take up to 48 hours due to the temperatures to reached at full speed, thus \"[e]ectricity from the grid is usually and customarily necessary for these processes which require the Turbines to turn at a low RPM for longer periods of time.\"156 This step also tests whether all lubrication systems and fluid filtration systems are operating ft correctly through the DCS.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 117; Exhibit C-38; Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 84.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 117: Exhibit C-38; Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 84.\n\nStatement of Claim, para, 117; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Eiders, para. 84.\n\n**(b) Milestone II: First Fire**\n--------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nAt \"First Fire\" the Static Frequency Converter (the **\"SFC\"**) speeds up the Turbines to approximately two hundred rotations per minute (200 RPM) before they are ignited.157 Accomplishing this milestone proves; that the ignition systems are sequencing properly; that they natural gas system necessary for igniting the liquid fuel is fully operational; that the fuel to air ? ratio is correct; that the damper system controlling fresh and return air is operating correctly; and that the liquid fuel system can supply the necessary amounts of fuel, at the proper time, to ignite the Turbines.158 After the Turbines reach speeds above one thousand eight-hundred ? rotations per minute (1800 RPM), the SFC \"drops out\" and the Turbines are propelled by liquid or natural gas combustion.159\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 118; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 85.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 118; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 85.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 118: Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 85.\n\n**(c) Milestone III: Full Speed No Load**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nIn the Full Speed No Load (**\"FSNL\"**) phase, the Turbines are ignited to full speed - approximately five thousand four hundred rotations per minute (5400 RPM) - this speed is maintained, and then slowed down to a stop.160 According to the Claimant, \"[t]his is internationally acknowledged as the most important milestone, as it indicates that all systems are not only individually working but that the Power Station including all of these systems is also able to function as a whole.\"161 Achieving this milestone entails \u201ftuning\" the Turbines at low speeds - less than one thousand live hundred rotations per minute (1500 RP.M) -- several times per day and for long periods of time.162 The PPA allows for approximately thirty (30) days of \"tuning\" to accomplish this final commissioning step.163\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 1.19; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 86.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 119; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 86.\n\nStatement of Claim, para,.119; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para, 86.\n\nStatement of Claim, para, i 14; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para, 81,\n\n**(d) Milestone IV : Full Speed Full Load**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe final milestone. Full Speed Full Load (**\"FSFL\"**), signals the completion of the commissioning process, whereby \"the equipment is gradually loaded with back feed from the National Grid, indicating that the systems can handle the load.\"164 According to the Claimant, \"a considerable amount of tuning is also required to finalize this process.\"165\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 120; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 87; *see also* Exhibit C-39: Witness Statement of Robert MacDonald, para. 13.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 120: Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 87.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nAccording to the Respondent the Claimant\u2019s \"[l]abelling [of FSNL] as a \u2018milestone\u2019... is a clever misnomer.\"166 It asserts that the \u2018Milestones\u2019 the Claimant must achieve under the PPA in order to be entitled to payment are set forth in the Third Schedule to the PPA, and \"[n]owhere in that Schedule is [FSNL] listed as a Milestone.\"167\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 62.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 62.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent does not expressly set out its version of the commissioning process is its entirety either in its Statement of Defense or in its Rejoinder, but it emphasizes instead that the key \u2018milestone\u2019 the Claimant \"was obligated to achieve under the PPA in order to earn Tolling Fees was \u2018Complete Final Testing and Commissioning\u2019 of the Barge within 90 days of the Effective Date (PPA Clause 11.4)\"; or, \"[a]lternatively, Balkan could demonstrate a right to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA if it could show that all of the systems on the Barge were ready for Final Testing and Commissioning subject only to the installation of (\u00bfy Transmission Line connecting the Barge to the National Grid.\"168 In its Rejoinder, the. Respondent draws support for its assertion that the Claimant did not complete foe commissioning of certain systems (that it alleges could have been commissioned without.connecting to the National Grid) from the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, which claims that the standard procedure for the commissioning process consists of the following eight steps.\n\n**The first stage** is to carry out a thorough survey of all the equipment and prepare a full assessment of equipment condition, availability of spares and the necessary skilled personnel to install these replacements. From this survey Balkan should have produced a very detailed (Level-3) schedule of the work required to repair, refurbish and commission.the Power Station. [Footnote omitted]\n\n**The second stage** of the process is to purchase, deliver and install all the identified items that required replacement and/or refurbishment. Once these have been installed, initial tests must be conducted, such as pressure tests in piping systems, resistance, continuity tests and loop checks of the control circuits in electrical systems all of which are necessary before anything can be energised. This work, and the work in stages three and four below, can be undertaken using any available medium or low voltage power supply. Because the Barge was equipped with a Black Start Generator (**\"BSG\"**), the opportunity should be taken at this stage to make it operational for the latter stages of commissioning and testing when larger quantities of electrical energy will be required to rotate and accelerate a gas turbine.\n\n**The third stage** of the process involves running plant auxiliaries, such as pumps and control valves, to circulate the necessary fluids such as lubricating oil, fuel and cooling water and checking that the designed flow rates and pressures are being achieved. Once this stage has been completed, and the plant parameters recorded, the gas turbine can be put onto hairing round to provide an assurance that the rotor blades are not causing a rub on the stator that could indicate a bowed rotor on a turbine that has not been regularly rotated.\n\nAlso at this stage the plant controls, and the control logic, can be tested to prove that they can start and stop the various auxiliary drives, and where there is duty and standby plant, the auto changeover from duty to standby can be accomplished. The safety trips and alarms for the plant distributed control system (\"DCS\") should also be proven and witnessed at this stage. These test results are normally required by the plant insurers if a claim is needed. In the case of the gas turbine it is particularly important to ensure that all the automatic turbine safety trips are operational before a first fire is attempted.\n\nElectrically, the generator static tests (tests with the generator stationary) can be completed, and the 11 kV and 161 kV GIS switchgear functionally tested (in a de-energised state) along with their associated protection systems, to ensure that they are fully operational and that electrical safety is assured.\n\n**The fourth stage** leads up to and includes first firing of the gas turbine and is significant as this is the first time that the turbine is accelerated up to firing speed (but not full speed) using the turbine control system. Particular care has to be taken with liquid fuelled turbines to ensure that any unburned liquid fuel does not accumulate in the combustion chamber but does drain into the false start fuel drain tank before the next start attempt. [Footnote omitted]\n\nThe first fire commissioning milestone also indicates that the fuel supply and the pilot ignition systems are both functioning. First fire is of necessity a short duration event to prove the firing and rotational capability of the turbine and its starting system, that the bearings remain cool and that there are no unexpected mechanical noises from the rotating machinery. This stage also requires powering up the static frequency converter (SFC) which energises the electrical generator thus using it as a starter motor to accelerate the turbine to firing speed.\n\n**The fifth stage:** Once first firing is completed and any malfunctions corrected, the next stage of commissioning entails accelerating the turbine to full speed no load (**\"FSNL\"**) and maintaining this speed whilst a number of checks are carried out on the combustion and control performance and to allow the turbine to \"heat soak\".169 Depending upon the turbine type, FSNL requires around 25% of the full load fuel consumption as the gas turbine drives its own compressor. Sustained FSNL is a necessary pre-requisite to prove the various mechanical and electrical auxiliary systems and to allow dynamic testing to be completed on the generator and the synchronizing equipment. As detailed below, in our opinion Balkan never successfully achieved a recognized sustained FSNL milestone during the commissioning process.\n\n**The sixth stage**: If a BSG is available, this may now be used to start the Barge auxiliaries, energise the static frequency converter, start the Gas Turbine (**\"GT\"**) and accelerate up to FSNL. Once sustained FSNL is achieved, the GT generator should be dynamically commissioned and tested, and when all is proven, the BSG and GT generator are synchronized and the BSG is then shut down, [Footnote omitted]\n\n**The seventh stage**: The GT generator may now be synchronized with the 161 kV Transmission Line. At this point, Full Speed *Full* Load (**\"FSFL\"**) commissioning commences. This involves incrementally adding load to the GT generator until it is operating at full load.\n\n**The eighth stage**: Once full load operation is achieved on. both GT generators, final performance testing is conducted to prove that the power station is operating in accordance with its design parameters and is ready for commercial operation.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 62.\n\nExpert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, at 6, fn. 5: \"As discussed below, there are internationally recognized standards defining the parameters for FSNL. *See e.g.,* R-5.1 at Clause 6.3.11 for guidance as to turbine test requirements. Turbine manufacturers also have their own commissioning procedures.\"\n\n**D. USE OF, AND UNITED STATES PROCEEDING AGAINST, SUBCONTRACTORS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Background to the United States proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant employed several subcontractors on the Barge, including ProEnergy Services LLC (**\"ProEnergy\"**), ABB Group (**\"ABB\"**) and Ansaldo.\n\n142.\n\nSince many of the undisputed facts related to the commissioning work completed by the Claimant, as well as the Respondent\u2019s factual assertions with regards to certain disputed facts,170 are established by documents procured from the ProEnergy Litigation *(infra),* the Tribunal finds it instructive, in setting out the Statement of Facts, to give a brief summary of the ProEnergy Litigation.\n\nSee *e.g.,* Statement of Defense, paras. \u00ce4, 15, 23, 24, 38-55; Rejoinder, paras. 2-6, 56, 63.\n\n143.\n\nIn September 2007, the Claimant subcontracted ProEnergy to assist it in commissioning the Power Station. Two legal proceedings were subsequently commenced between these parties: first, on 18 February 2009, ProEnergy brought a. suit against Balkan US in the US District Court for non-payment of its invoices, amounting to over USD 750,000.171 On 8 January 2010, Balkan US instituted action against ProEnergy and its affiliates in the Texas State Court, These proceedings are collectively referred to as the **(\"ProEnergy Litigation\")**.172\n\nExhibit R-5: \"Petition for Damages, Answer and Counterclaim. First Amended Answer to.Defendant\u2019s Counterclaim, *ProEnergy Services., LLC v. Balkan Energy Co.,* No, 2:09-cv-04026\".\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 14, fn. 5; Exhibit R-4: \"Plaintiff\u2019s First Amended Petition, *Balkan Energy Co. v. ProEnergy Services. Int'l, Inc.,* et al., No. 09-01944\".\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration in the present arbitration alleges that it \"could have charged Tolling Fees already since July 2008\", based on its claim that it had achieved \"First Fire\" for the Turbines as of that dette, but notes that the Claimant does not to include this assertion in its Statement of Claim.173 The Respondent further relies on the deposition of Mr. Elders on 1 March 2010 in the ProEnergy Litigation, in which he stated that, to as of 28 October 2008, ProEnergy was in breach of its contract with BEL/Balkan US and, as a to: result of its negligence and incompetence, ProEnergy was not \"even close\" to commissioning the Barge or completing its commissioning work.174\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 40, fn. 11, citing BEL\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 63. Respondent indicates that this allegation is in Balkan US\u2019s Statement of Claim in the *ProEnergy* Litigation, para. 63, but does not provide it as an exhibit to its Statement of Defense.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 39; Rejoinder, para. 3; Exhibit R-7: \"Deposition of Phillip David Elders, *ProEnergy Services, LLC* r. *Balkan Energy Co.,* No. 09-4026\", at 179:25-180:4-,.183:7-16.\n\n145.\n\nSometime thereafter, Ghana commenced proceedings against ProEnergy in the US District Court to obtain documents regarding the work ProEnergy performed on the Power Station, as well as documents relating to litigation filed against it by Balkan US.175 The Claimant intervened in that proceeding to oppose Ghana\u2019s application for discovery, but the US District Court granted Ghana\u2019s application in Orders dated 7 February and 6 June 2011.176 Both BEL\u2019s/Balkan US\u2019s motion to intervene and application for reconsideration of the 7 February 2011 Order were rejected by the US District Court.177\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 14.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 14; Exhibit R-3: \"Order. *In re Government of Ghana,* No. 11-9002 (W.D.

Commissioning Steps Not Completed by the Claimant Allegedly Due to Inadequate Site Electricity**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Undisputed Facts**\n------------------------\n\n152.\n\nWhile it is clear that the Claimant faced a number of challenges its the commissioning process from late 2007 through to 2009, the reasons for these challenges are disputed by the Parties. In particular, the Parties disagree as to whether the provision of inadequate site electricity by the Respondent made commissioning more difficult or more costly.\n\n153.\n\nOn 3 September 2007, Mr. Elders agreed or certified that \"electricity has been supplied at the required Voltage and Frequency and is available for the express use of Balkan [...] in executing [its] obligations in the [PPA]\".188\n\nExhibit R-38; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 3 (Cross-examination of John Bryant), 173:2-8.\n\n154.\n\nTo compensate for the alleged lack of site electricity that ensued, the Claimant purchased and rented various power generators sometime in 2007. On 17 November 2007, two such generators, each having power capacity of 200 kVA, broke down and were replaced by new ones of a different brand.189\n\nExhibit R-114; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 3 (Cross-examination of John Bryant), 173:23174:13.\n\n155.\n\nOn 14 December 2007, Mr. J.D. Robinson from ProEnergy wrote to Mr. Elders at BEL requesting \"three separate generators to supply various systems to the barge\".190 In his reply. Mr. Elders questioned Mr. Robinson\u2019s need for the additional generators, adding that \"[t]his is a total overkill. Your load for the barge is less than 500 amps.\"191\n\nExhibit R-25; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 3 (Cross-examination of John Bryant), 175:1-6.\n\nExhibit R-25.\n\n**(b) Disputed Facts**\n----------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it required a capacity of 2,000 kVa for site electricity.192 It states that, as a result of the Respondent\u2019s failure to make this amount of electricity available to the Barge, if was obliged to purchase a 1,000 kVa transformer costing USD 30,000 in March 2008.193\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 151.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 154. *See also* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 54.\n\n157.\n\nThe Claimant points out. that the Respondent does not dispute the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the 33 kV line running from the local electricity distribution network to the Barge was not operational in April or May 2008.194 But at the same time, the Claimant also states that it rejected ProEnergy\u2019s requests for additional generators in December 2007 precisely because \"Elders had recently been advised and, in fact verified that the 33 kV line had been connected and was operational.\"195\n\nReply, para. 78.\n\nReply, para. 81 ; Rejoinder, para. 111\n\nii. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant\u2019s assertions as to the time when the 33 kV line became operational are \"factually incorrect.\" in this regard the Respondent points to the evidentiary record, which shows that Mr. Elders had verified and certified that the 33 kV line was both operational and sufficient on 3 September 2007.196 Accordingly, the Respondent reiterates that, on December 2007 when the Claimant admits it rejected ProEnergy\u2019s request for additional generators because the 33 kV line linking the local electricity distribution network to the Barge \"had already been in operation for three months and work at the Site by ProEnergy was well underway\u2019\u2019.197 By so doing, the Respondent states that the Claimant \"trips over its own inconsistent positions\" in its Reply by first alleging that the 33 kV line was not operational until : May 2008, but then, in December 2007, asserting that it had indeed been connected and was operational.198\n\nRejoinder, para, 113; Exhibit R-38: \"Ministry of Energy, Supply of Electricity to the Site (Construction Power), Work Completion Form\".\n\nRejoinder, para. 113.\n\nRejoinder, para. 110.\n\n159.\n\nAs will be discussed in greater detail below in addressing the Parties\u2019 Arguments, the Respondent asserts that the position originally taken by the Claimant in its Statement of Claim \"confusingly runs several concepts together\".199 in particular, the Claimant\u2019s position:\n\n(i) confused the capacity of the 33 kV line with the capacity of the transformer on the Barge, (ii) was contrary to the position it took with ProEnergy in denying ProEnergy\u2019s requests for additional generators, (iii) was legally inconsistent with [the Claimant\u2019s] claim in the *ProEnergy* Litigation that ProEnergy could and should have completed the Power Station by March 2008, and (iv) at best, extended Balkan\u2019s time to complete the commissioning to October 2008.200\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 76.\n\nRejoinder, para, 109; *see also* Statement of Defense, paras. 76-84.\n\n160.\n\nOn 17 June 2008, Mr. Elders and his team met with the Minister of Energy and his team, to discuss the progress of the Project.201 During this meeting, Mr. Elders made clear to the Minister that while he had indeed certified that Ghana had provided site, electricity to the Barge on 4 May 2008, on 5 May 2008 the power went out five times. Similar power outages continued to occur thereafter, normally in the early hours of the morning. In particular, Mr. Elders complained that there was no way that the existing 200 kVa transformer could meet the Barge\u2019s power needs, since at least 1,000 amps of power was required at any one time - an amount of power which the 200 kVa transformer could not support, Mr. Eiders further advised the Minister that Balkan was spending over USD 4,000 on extra generators to provide sufficient site electricity to continue their commissioning efforts on the Barge. The video recording of this meeting shows that the Minister agreed to provide more reliable site electricity.\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 42, Video of 17 June 2008 Meeting.\n\n**3.

Robinson:\n\nFoliowing your request, we are pleased to submit our best offer for the supplies and supervision activities that will be necessary to rehabilitate the Turbogenerator Unit of the Osagyefo Barge power station (N. 2 Gas Turbines V64.3A and N.2 Generators type.WY18Z-066LLT) and update the related GTCMPS systems, in order to make the Units ready for proper and reliable operation.\n\nThe rehabilitation activities will be performed on the basis of previous inspections performed in January 2005 and following the activities carried out on Unit 1 finalised to start it at Full Speed no Load.205\n\nThe scope of the work to be done was stated to include:\n\n1.2 Supply of material for Rehabilitation of Turbogenerator Units (N.2 Gas Turbines V64.3A and N. 2 Generators type W Y18Z-066LLT) as defined in the paragraph 3.1 of our Technical Specification [Annex 1 to the letter],\n\n1.2 Supervisors and Specialists for Rehabilitation of Turbogenerator Units and commissioning assistance during commissioning phase.\n\n1.3 Supply of the Updated Hardware and Software of the on-site existing GTCMPS Systems, and retrofit of protection and control system.\n\n1.4 Supervisors for Upgrading of Hardware and Software of the on-site existing GTCMPS Systems, and retrofit of protection and control system.206\n\nDelivery of the main supplies was foreseen in 24 months for Unit 1 and 30 months for Unit 2, considering the order date within July 2008.207 Further, the offer was based on the execution of the rehabilitation activities within the periods of August 2010-Oetober 2010 for Unit 1 and February 2011-April 2011 for Unit 2.208\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 165 \"Utter from Ansaldo transmitting report (3505-3520)\", at 1.\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 165, at I,\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 165, at 3.\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 165, at 3.\n\n165.\n\nThe prices for rehabilitating Turbogenerator Unit 1 were stated as being \u20ac 5,840,000, \u20ac3,808,000 for Turbogenerator Unit 2, \u20ac 1,552,000 for supervision, and \u20ac 2,402,000 for the updated hardware and software GTCMPS systems, as well as the retrofit of protection and control system.209\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 165, at 3-4.\n\n166.\n\nBEL wrote to the Ministry of Energy on 2 September 2008. asking it to confirm that it wanted to go ahead with operating the Barge on liquid fuel, even though the costs would be extremely high.210 In that regard, BEL confirmed \"its readiness to start its first power generation starting on 1st November, 2008\" and advised that it needed \"to confirm [its] high grade fuel supply, storage and site delivery schedules to enable [it to] go commercial on [the] scheduled date.\u2019\u2019211 BEL further stated that, due to the unavailability of high grade diesel fuel for power production on the local market, it had been forced to test run the barge on lower volumes of jet fuel, which is even more expensive.212 BEL thereby advised the Ministry that they should \"do everything possible to get natural gas to the barge as soon as possible.\"213\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 121 \"Balkan letter to Ministry of Energy dated Sept. 2, 2008, re: Power Generation Consumption\".\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 121, at 1.\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 121, at 2,\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 121, at 2.\n\n167.\n\nIn its daily report to BEL for the period 30 August to 5 September 2008, ProEnergy provided the following status updates with regard to the firing of Turbine 1:\n\n31-Aug-08\n\nd. Unit 1 fired and run up to 4000rpm. The unit nipped on over speed protection. Grounding of speed sensors to isolated ground carried out.\n\ne. Unit 1 retired and run up to 3450 rpm. Unit shut down due to extreme temperature on outer casing, thermocouple feed back did not trip the unit. On investigation of thermocouples it was found that the feed back had been by-passed in the DCS, this has now been corrected. A fire occurred inside of the turbine but extinguished. No damage occurred.\n\n[...]\n\n1-Sep-08\n\nb. Unit 1 fired and run up to 3800 rpm; the unit was shut down due to high exhaust temperatures.\n\nc. We continue to encounter speed sensor problems; further trouble shooting is ongoing.\n\n[...]\n\n2-Sep-08\n\ne. Unit 1 re-fired at 16H03 and tripped on over speed, Sensor 103,.103 and 106 failed,\n\n[...]\n\ni.

Gas supply has been exhausted,\n\n[...]\n\n5-Sep-08\n\nd. Unit fired, tripped on flame failure. There is a sequence in the logic, if the speed sensors are faulty and the unit does not trip, then a flame failure is activated. Our efforts to by-pass the speed sensor trip would seem to have been in vain.\n\n[...]\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe speed sensors are preventing further progress on Unit 1 [...]214\n\nExhibit C-36, Attachment 4 \"ProEnergy Daily Reports dated Aug. 30-Sept. 5, 2008\".\n\n168.\n\nIn its daily report to BEL for the period 20-26 September 2008, ProEnergy reported the following with respect to Turbine 1:\n\ng. Start Unit 1, unit trip on \"flame failure\". Investigated failure and found flame scanner lens coasted with soot. Cleaned and replaced lens.\n\nh. Restart Unit 1, at 1800RPM the SFC tripped \"max amps on bridge rectifier\". Reset trip.\n\ni. Restart Unit 1 again and same trip on SFC occurred. Attempt to contact Ansaldo SFC engineer. No response,\n\n[...]\n\n24-Sep-08\n\ne. Attempt to fire Unit 1, continuous trips related to fuel valve. The new HSS cards (Not Ansaldo Issue) were installed after wiring modifications were carried out. We reverted back to the old cards and wiring configurations and will carry out testing on the fuel valves. It would seem that the new HSS cards need to be programmed by Ansaldo.\n\nf. During continuity checks between the GIS and synchronization panels we have found that GIS 1 wiring goes to Sync panel 2 and GIS 2 wiring goes to Sync panel 1. Sync panel 1 is connected to the DCS. In essence we have no DCS to GIS 1 for Unit 1. This is an original wiring configuration from Ansaldo. We are currently looking at the best course of action to go forward.\n\n[...]\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe new HSS cards have been received on site; however we have not been able to check their functionality as we have encountered various other problems on the unit [I Turbine]. The fuel oil shuts off valves started responding intermittently, some of the solenoids had failed; we had sufficient spares on site to correct the problem. The SFC has started tripping on various causes: we have investigated the BSDG as that seemed to be the source of the problem. We are unable to access the SFC program to enable further trouble shooting. Balkan Energy should consider the return of Ansaldo controls engineer and Ansalso [sic] SFC engineer\n\n169.\n\nIn its daily report to BEL for the period 27 September to 3 October 2008, ProEnergy remarked on the progress of commissioning Turbine 1. as follows:\n\n28-Sep-08\n\nc. The hydraulic block and regulating valves have been stripped from Unit 2 and installed on Unit 1. Ail systems were normalized and the unit engaged on turning gear. Unit 1 turning gear is now back to normal and running at 145RPM. (2 complete sets of hydraulic blocks, regulating valves and gauges to be ordered, plus a spare set of regulating valves).\n\nd. Started Unit 1, unit tripped on SFC/BSDG related problem, it is also thought that we could be starving the unit of air as we have installed the primary air filters. Again we had a fire inside of the turbine which self-extinguished.\n\n[...]\n\n1-Oct-08\n\nc. Start unit l, load BSDG to enable trip for the purpose of diagnosing the fault on the BSDG. The unit tripped at 1690.RPM and 205 deg C. Trip was SFC/BSDG related. Yet another fire inside of the turbine 900deg C. Fire self-extinguished,\n\n[...]\n\n2-Oct-08\n\ne. Open combustion chamber and carry out a nozzle inspection. The nozzles appear to be in a good state. However the 1st stage turbine blades have sustained damage and would need to be changed out. This unit can no longer be fired under current condition, the damage sustained by the unit can only deteriorate further.\n\n170.\n\nOn 9 July 2009, Ansaldo certified in the following terms that both Turbines had reached FSNL:\n\nThis letter is io certify that the two Gas Turbines (V64.3A) located on the Osagyefo Power Barge have successfully completed the milestone of Full Speed No Load (FSNL), This accomplishment was reached without electrical grid connectivity.\n\nThe two turbines have reached this milestone under the supervision and witnessing of Ansaldo Energ\u00eda, the Equipment Manufacturer of these units.\n\nProperly designed electrical grid connectivity is mandatory to finalize any further commissioning milestones.215\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 157 \"Ansaldo letter: Full Speed No Load\", dated 9 July 2009.\n\n171.\n\nOn 2 October 2009, Mr. Savio from Ansaldo submitted a Memorandum of Understanding to Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Energy,216 which commented on the state of the Turbines as follows, in relevant part:\n\n**Certification**: Both parties certify that the two V64.3A Ansaldo Turbines have accomplished the milestone of Full Speed No Load. This accomplishment was certified in writing by Ansaldo Energ\u00eda S.p.\u00c0 to Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited on July 9, 2009. This milestone was made possible only by the direct supervision and work performance of Ansaldo Energia S.p.A. The final commissioning can only be completed when electrical grid connectivity and energization is provided.\n\n**Ansaldo Energia SpA Scope:**\n\n\u2026\n\n3. Make modifications and repairs of turbines (V64.3A) as necessary to operate with natural gas.\n\n4. Complete final commissioning with full speed full load for natural gas operation.217\n\nDay 2 Merits Hearing Transcript, at 1243:23-124:2: \"Now here is a letter written in October to the Ministry of Energy directly, because apparently the Ministry of Energy, unbeknownst to us, had gone to Ansaldo and asked them to do a technical and financial audit of Balkan.\"\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment *159* \"Memorandum of Understanding dated Oct. 2,2009\", at 1.\n\n172.\n\nOn 30 July 2010, Ansaldo wrote to the Ministry of Energy, putting its certification of the Turbines at FSNL in context. The relevant part of the letter reads as follows;\n\n3. We take the occasion to remark that 2 years ago BE[L] ordered AEN to perform whatever activity needed until FSNL was reached on both GT units and nothing else, highlighting that fact that, from a technical point of view, the FSNL condition is only but a first step in the much longer process of other necessary activities to be undertaken like the actual refurbishment up to real operational readiness of the Osagyefo Barge Power Plant. Among others, but not limited to: Control systems TCS and AVR elements replacement, cabinets and cabling completion and testing; generators complete inspection and tests without and with load: GT\u2019s TMR needed implementation; full auxiliaries functional checks and complete final units recommissioning among the unavoidable major steps yet to be performed, before Full Speed Full Load conditions can be reached.\n\nWe are very sorry about the misleading verbal information given by Ansaldo Energ\u00eda Sales Engineer during the meetings held last year and this year in Your premises. We confirm all needed internal actions have been taken at his regards, informing that all future desirable relationships will be kept by another qualified AEN sales engineer.\n\nThe same wrong information received from the Ansaldo Sales Engineer lead also our Country Representative Mr. Henri JM Wientjes to equivocal conclusions, unfortunately slowing all progress on the matter of the barge recovery.218\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 160 \"Ansaldo letter dated July 30, 2010, re: Ansaldo letter of 7/9/09 with Proposal (3469-3470)\". at 1-2.\n\nii. Disputed Facts\n------------------\n\n*The. Claimant\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------\n\n173.\n\nIn its Statement of Claim, the Claimant initially alleged that it attained FSNL on both turbines on 30 June 2009.219 The Claimant explained that \"[h]aving realized that no grid energization was to be expected anytime soon. Elders decided to try and see how far BEL would get in reaching their next milestone [FSNL] with mimicking [sic] grid connectivity\"; with \"the added challenge of having to mimick [sic] back feed with site electricity,\"220\n\nStatement of Claim, paras, 224, 258.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 258.\n\n174.\n\nHowever, in its Reply, the Claimant concedes that it did not in fact achieve mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL.221 The Claimant maintains that in order to conduct \"final mechanical testing\" at FSNL, it needed \"full grid connectivity.\"222\n\nReply, para. 100.\n\nReply, para 100. *See also* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 61.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that Ansaldo had recommended against the use of the **\"Black Start Generator\"** for commissioning, and that the Claimant was entitled to rely on the manufacturer\u2019s advice.223 In its letter to BEL dated 13 January 2009, Ansaldo advised as follows, in the relevant part:\n\n**Commissioning activities using the Black Start Generator** - The Black Start Generator is not utilized to perforin activities of long duration like commissioning. There are significant difficulties and risks associated with attempting to commission the power plan with the black start generator. Therefore, it is preferable that Grid Connectivity be utilized for the entire commissioning process.224\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 153; *see also* Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 5 (Cross examination of Mr. Osafo), 44:7-20.\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 153, at 1,\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent counters that grid connectivity only becomes \"an essential and necessary condition of the commissioning process... when a Transmission Line is required to provide sufficient Load on the turbines so that they can be tested through FSFL\".225 Alternatively, the Respondent submits that the Claimant could have used the Black Start Generator on the Barge to achieve mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL - a procedure which ProEnergy described in a memorandum to the Claimant.226 The Respondent finds further support in the expert testimony of Mr. Fainhurst, who testified that he had personally performed FSNL tests on turbines without grid connectivity using a Black Start Generator.227\n\nRejoinder, para. 69.\n\nRejoinder, para. 71; Expert Report, of Parsons Brinckerhoff, paras. 5.16, 5.18; Exhibit C-36, Attachment *13:* \"Letter to Phil Elders from J,D. Robinson [of ProEnergy]\", excerpted in Rejoinder, para. 72.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 134.\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Turbines \"were in a complete state of disrepair in August 2008 when the Essiama Transmission Lines were energized.\"228 The Respondent refers to several exchanges between the Claimant and ProEnergy, obtained in the discovery of documents from the ProEnergy proceedings, which show that there were problems with the DCS logic, including fuel injection, piping and wiring which prevented the Turbines from achieving FSNL,229 In particular, the Respondent emphasizes that, by the Claimant\u2019s own admission, ProEnergy irreparably damaged the rotor blades of Turbine 2 in October 2008 when it unsuccessfully sought \"over a hundred times\" to start the generator.230\n\nRejoinder, pant. 74; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 130\n\nRejoinder, para. 74.\n\nRejoinder, para. 74, referring to R-8, at 46:19-47:4, R-4, para. 5.17(1), and R-9.\n\n**(b) The Condition of the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines Prior to Being Energised on 8 August and 1.3 November 2008, Respectively**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nAs it appears from the Parties' explanation at the Hearing, there are three connection points on the Barge to the 161 kVa GIS: a first bay that connects to the Essiama substation, a second bay that connects to the Elubo substation and a third bay that \"was for future work\". Each bay could be operated in isolation or in combination with each other, depending on the route through which power should be evacuated.231\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 2, 65:1-6; 65:16-19.\n\n179.\n\nCurrently, the Elubo substation is not able to receive back-feed from the Barge. It needs to be energised through the Essiama line, which extends to Tower *3.* The Claimant\u2019s position is that the Essiama substation could not take the full load from the Barge, and that Ghana liad to energise the Elubo Transmission Line as well.232 The Respondent contends that the Essiama line alone suffices to power the Barge.\n\n*See e.g.* Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 2, 70:13-16.\n\ni. Undisputed Facts\n-------------------\n\n180.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that BEL complained to Ghana about \"regular and dense tree overgrowth of the [Transmission] lines all along the route\", noting that such overgrowth \"would cause short circuiting to appear as soon as the transmission line would be. charged with electricity,\"233 According to the Claimant, Mr. Elders \"made a helicopter flight (on 25 November 2007) from the Power Station to the regional stations at Elubo in the [e]ast and Essiama in the west\" and took photos of the alleged tree overgrowth along the route of the Transmission Lines.234\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 162.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 162.\n\n181.\n\nOn 27 November 2007, Mr. Elders wrote to the then Minister of Energy, Mr. Adda, reporting the Claimant\u2019s concerns about the \"jungle overgrowth on the transmission lines and the work required on the two regional stations.\"235\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 162, referring to Exhibit C-38, Attachment 115: \"BE[L] Letter to MOE.\"\n\n182.\n\nHaving received no response from the Respondent, Mr, Elders again wrote to the Ministry of Energy on 17 December 2007, suggesting that the Respondent \"focus on one of the two regional stations, the one at Elubo, first... [because] it seemed designed for the full capacity of the Power Station and could thus, if necessary, operate on its own.\"236\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 162, referring to Exhibit C-38, Attachment 116: \"BE[L] re: lack of grid connectivity.\"\n\n183.\n\nOn 4 April 2008, a site visit of the Barge was conducted by the Respondent, at which time the Claimant asserts Mr. Elders \"brought up the other matter that was slowing down the reliable and adequate national grid connectivity; tree growth on the transmission lines.\"237\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 172.\n\n184.\n\nOn 28 July 2008, the Respondent advised the Claimant in writing that it would soon energise the Essiama Transmission Line and that it was prepared to connect the Power Station to the National Grid using this line.238\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 91.\n\n185.\n\nOn 29 July 2008, the Claimant responded to this notification with a series of concerns that it claimed would prevent the Essiama Transmission Line from being energised.239\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 92, referring to Exhibit R-26: \"Letter from Phillip Elders to the Minister of Energy. Re: Grid Connection Process, Visual Inspection of VRA Audit Results.\"\n\n186.\n\nOn 12 August 2008, the Respondent wrote back to the Claimant, indicating that its concerns had been addressed and that it saw no obstacle to energizing the Essiama Transmission Line.240\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 93, referring to Exhibit R-27: \"E-mail chain between Joseph Wiafe, Isaac Nyantakyi, and Phillip Elders, Re: Fw: line clearance and ground details (typical).\"\n\n187.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, the Respondent energised the Essiama Transmission Line to Tower 3 (the tower just outside the Project Site) and informed the Claimant that it was ready to connect the Barge to the National Grid.241 The Essiama Transmission Line has a capacity of 365 MV A, which is the maximum output of the Power Station, pursuant to the requirements specified in the Fourth Schedule to the PPA.242 Mr. Elder\u2019s testimony at the Hearing was that Ghana energised the Essiama Transmission Line by simply putting \"a jumper on it to the other side of the transmission tower and backfed the Elubo substation.\"243\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 93, referring to Exhibit R-27: \"E-mail chain between Joseph Wiafe, Isaac Nyantakyi, and Phillip Elders, Re: Fw: line clearance and ground details (typical).\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 95,\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 96.\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimant states that the VRA cleared the tree overgrowth from the Transmission Lines in October 2008.244\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 190.\n\n189.\n\nOn 13 November 2008, the Respondent energised the Elubo Transmission Line to Tower 3.245\n\nHearing on the Merits, Day 2, 70:20-22; *see also id.,* 69:18-20.\n\nii. Disputed Facts\n------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n190.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant appears to maintain its position that the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines were not fully commissioned and rehabilitated, but does not expressly refute the facts described above.246 However, in its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant refers to Mr. Osafo\u2019s testimony, which affirmed that, at the dates referred to, the Elubo line was energised but was not ready.247 Mr. Osafo\u2019s testimony made reference to the logs produced at the time, which suggest that the attempted energization resulted in a general fault in the line.248\n\nReply, para. 22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 75; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 5, 10:25 to 12:11.\n\n*See* Appendix \u00c0-18 to the Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n191.\n\nAlso, there is a suggestion in the Claimant\u2019s pleadings that it had somehow documented that, even after the Essiama Transmission Line was energised in August 2008, it was unreliable and frequently could not carry the requisite energy to power the Barge, notwithstanding its purported capacity of 365 MVA. However, the Tribunal is unable to find any Barge status reports or other express documentation to that effect. In its Post-Hearing Submission,249 the Claimant makes reference to the pictures and report of inspection of the Essiama substation conducted by Mr. Robinson, which suggest that the Essiama substation required equipment modifications and recalibration to interconnect with the Barge.250 The Claimant adds that, in order to connect to the substation on the Barge, both the Essiama and the Elubo substations would have had to coordinate relay protection,251 which it argues was never completed.252\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 76.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 76.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript Day 5, 130:6 to 131:10.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 6, 4: 13-15: 25:1-29:5.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that \"it is clear when viewed in the context of the timeline and the meetings and agreements between the parties, that Mr. Wiafe [the Chief Executive Officer of GRIDCo] instructed Isaac Nyantakyi [Technical Manager at the VRA] to energise the lines despite the recognized deficiencies in the transmission lines and transmission towers in order to claim that the Government had complied with its obligations under paragraph 3.3 of the PPA.\u2019\u2019253 The Claimant also contends that \"[w]orks on the power plant, transmission line and substations to evacuate power from the power plant are still in progress\" today.254\n\nReply, para. 29.\n\nReply, para. 27.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n193.\n\nIn reply to the Claimant's contentions, the Respondent points out that the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines were energised on 8 August and 13 November 2008, respectively.255 However, BEL \"could not have connected the Power Station to either the Essiama or Elubo Transmission Lines when they were energised because BEL had yet to complete the 161 kV electrical system on the Barge.\"\n\nRejoinder, para, 78.\n\n**4.

Even if the Grid Code was not finally promulgated until October 2009, that is, two years after the conclusion of the PPA, the Claimant contends that the existing law and prudent industry practice existing in Ghana at the time of the conclusion of the contract show that the Respondent was responsible for the RTU279 The Claimant argues that the 2007 version of the Grid Code was the final version that was circulated and applied, because unlike the April version it was not entitled \"draft\" and also because regulation 3 of LI 1937, passed on 5 June 2008, was drafted on the basis of the said Grid Code.280\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 79-80.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 81-82.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant always recognized that installing and commissioning the RTU on the Barge was its responsibility.281 From December 2007 - when it assumed control of the Barge - to April 2008, the Claimant unsuccessfully sought to find a sub-contractor other than ABB or Ansaldo to install and commission the RTU.282 For instance, in December 2007, the Claimant sought and obtained a site survey report from ABB regarding the status and condition of various ABB systems on the Barge, Including the original RTU that ABB had installed on the Barge when it was first delivered to Ghana.283 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertion that it was merely apprising itself of the necessary commissioning work to be done on the RTU so that it could divide the work between itself and the Respondent.

Robinson:\n\nI\u2019ve attached the material tracking source document; we have spent a lot of time getting this document updated; how long do we wait for the Accra office to respond before we out source to Bob? You keep pushing for 10MAR08 [the Completion Date under the PPA]: we have to have 100% procurement support to meet any schedule or deadline...\n\nTo which Elders responds:\n\nDon't give me these weak excuses for not making March 10. Excuses, excuses,... first it was hotel, then food, then mosquitos, then snakes, and on and on. You need to overcome the poor performance of Pro Energy\u2019s promises and start and get the job done.\n\nLet\u2019s find a reason why and how you and your team can meet a milestone....\n\nStay focussed and get the job done.

Otherwise, your just an average Joe marking time and blaming life on other people.\n\nTo which Robinson replies:\n\nPro Energy Services has not performed poorly at any level on the Osagyefo Power Barge Project; on the contrary; if you\u2019ll take note of the attached documents; you can clearly see who has performed poorly and it is certainly not Pro Energy Services. A successful project is only successful if all participants have the same common goal; a successful project needs an accurate and responsive material supply chain, especially in a third world country; and last but certainly not least, a project like this one needs proper and responsive funding when requested. You have not fulfilled any of the project requirements....\n\n(ii) Another example from April 2008 discussing procurement problems and project delays:\"328\n\nJ.D. Robinson:\n\nI have tried for several months to reiterate the critical nature of a stream lined supply chain to facilitate our schedule of first firing Unit 1 : to date, our supply chain, our purchase order request to receipt of purchase order, our wire transfer request to positive confirmation of receipt of wire to specific vendor is sub standard and continues to impact the project, One example; Ansaldo has not been paid the Euro 57,500.00 that was sent In to Balkan on 27Feb08...\n\n(iii) On August 10, 2008, another in a series of these e-mails between the onsite ProEnergy Manager and Elders regarding Balkan\u2019s slow payment of invoices and their impact on the schedule:329\n\nJ.D. Robinson:\n\nYes, I\u2019m back; please explain what your message means, does it mean that I will receive the PO on Monday or will it be like all of the other PO's and payments that are made out of the Balkan office in Ghana. I have been trying to get Sud Chemie paid for over five weeks:\n\nI have been trying to get Alpha Standard paid for over five weeks and there are other simple examples. This is Project Execution and it is not being performed at any level of normality for this type of project.\n\nTo which Elders responds:\n\nStop your crap! I am tired of seeing these crappy emails. I have a long long long list of crap I could publicize on Pro Energy total failure and incompetence and you know' what I mean. Especially having the pretnix and diffusion piping wrongly piped for more than a month while you and others tried futilly to make that crap work,.. now' that is total incompetence that has cost ns untold amounts of money.\n\nSo cool your heals [sic] and get this thing started and stop the blasting on emails.330\n\n(iv) And on October 1 and September 25, 2008, respectively, Vincent Jones who was working on site at the time, wrote:331\n\nThe saga here continues:\n\nAfter changing out fuel supplies we had to rerun the return line as well. Attempted to fire the unit 3 times, 3 trips[\u2026] After tripping we had serious fire inside of the turbine *+/-* 900 deg C- Tomorrow Phil\u2019s motley crew is going to start the stripdown on the BSDG (god help them).\n\nI continue to advise the client regarding my concerns and he continuously ignores my advise. Today I have strongly advised against the stripping of the BSDG and have also advised that Balkan Need a Combustion Engineer on site as soon as possible.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWe also require Salt back on site. You know the situation here \"Balkan Policy,.... rig it\". I have repeatedly mentioned this to Elders, to date nothing has happened. Tim paid a visit to Ansaldo, guess what, They want cash on the table before they will entertain any further discussions regarding the barge,\n\n(v) E-mail of May 21, 2008 from J.D. Robinson:332\n\nAbout two months ago. while Phil Elders was at site, one of our transfer switches blew up and caught fire; root cause analysis revealed that loose connections were the cause and Phil Eiders was involved in this process as he tries.... with every body while he is on site, Louis and Phil got into a huge argument of this fact; the wires were loose as I checked them myself. The issue went away; last week, we were changing these same cables to replace the wiring to ensure we have reliability; well, here\u2019s where the story really begins; when they installed the new transfer switch for the one that blew up, they wired completely wrong: this was fine as they wired the two inputs and the one output wrong so, all worked fine. When they rewired it the second time, they wired one of the inputs per the diagram and left the other input and output wired wrong. So, when they energized the switch, it applied 400 VAC between neutral and Phase A: you cannot imagine the damage that occurred in less than 3 seconds; every laptop power supply, every printer, seven televisions and all kinds of various electrical and electronic equipment blew up.\n\n(vi) Reflecting ProEnergy\u2019s frustration with getting the Turbines up to first fire and the lack of adequate documentation to achieve Full Speed No Load, Robinson wrote the manufacturer, Ansaldo, on June 11,2008:333\n\nI have been assured by persons in Italy and in Ghana that the gas turbines on this barge were fire and brought to FSNL. Having lived with this machine for the last six months of my life and having personally inspected every single component on the barge including the combustion chambers and fuel nozzles of the turbines, J fully believe, based on my experience, that these machines have never been fired or if they were, it was for less than 10 seconds; SMOKE OUT OF THE STACK! My position is also supported by the lack of functional logic for critical areas of the barge; one in particular is the LF Injection Skid Bypass Control Valves. Carlo, you are somewhat aware of some of the issues that we have encountered; the software and wiring were setup for LVDT and yet we have 4 to 20 made transducers; the list goes on and on....\n\nI would really appreciate some immediate feedback on my problem as I\u2019m taking a lot of crap from this client about the lack of information flow between site and Ansaldo and at this point in time, I cannot defend myself. I need to talk with the GURU about how this machines is supposed to work during a start cycle and I need documents clearly define startup and FSNL Sequence.\n\n(vii) Then, on June 16, 2008, ProEnergy wrote the following progress report regarding its attempt to first fire Unit 1.334\n\nWe managed to manually first fire Unit.1 on Saturday; ignition gas valves, ignitors and LF Fuel injection control valves were manually manipulated. The unit responded fairly well with the exception of catching on fire as we has a lot of liquid fuel in the turbine that we had rinsed with water but collected in various places inside and outside of the turbine; we did not experience any damage as we have a trained fire fighting brigade. The DCS logic is simply not complete and I do not have a clue as to how Ansaldo fired this unit as they have told me; as I have stated before, I will, testify that these units have never fired simply because nothing works.\n\n(viii) On August 10, 2008, ProEnergy wrote Ansaldo:335\n\nLet me say this; with everything that we are finding, including speed pickups, flame scanner failures, LF Fuel Injection problems, HSS Module problems. TSA Modules problems and so on and so on I maintain my account that this machine never fired.\n\n(ix) And on August 12, 2008, one of the subcontractors on the site. Scott Kinney from Taurus Power, wrote in part:336\n\nNow I hear that [Phil Elders] is blaming ProEnergy for finding a problem that was hurting the project. All we have been doing for the last six weeks is to find problems. Whether it is corroded fittings, bad speed probes, failed HSS cards, everyday there are new problems. I suppose that Phil could blame every single problem on ProEnergy and why you don\u2019t know exactly what is wrong before it actually fails.\n\nI also don\u2019t appreciate his using my name as any part of blaming ProEnergy or anyone for problems found on the Barge. The Barge is a wealth of problem and none of them were created by ProEnergy.\n\nAs soon as a manager starts blaming his people for his problems he loses my respect. There he is in the meeting begging us to get the machine running no matter what. And when we find failed parts and obsolete equipment he asks us to find ways to work around them. So what if the pipes were backwards its just one of a hundred problems we have had to work through.\n\n(x) Finally, ProEnergy described the condition of the facility in its Daily Report of September 27-October 3, 2008 - just days before Balkan now claims the Power Station was ready for Final Testing and Commissioning:337\n\n\u25e6 Complete DCS system shutdown during change over. PCV lost and fuel oil stop valve controls lost. Shutdown DSC and reboot system. DCS normalized.\n\n\u25e6 Restart Unit.1, unit tripped at 1750RPM due to SFC/BSDG failure. A fire occurred inside of the turbine, the fire self extinguished.\n\n\u25e6 I have expressed my concerns to Balkan Energy regarding the continuous starting and tripping of the unit. It would appear that we are stalling to see degradation on the equipment. I have advised Balkan Energy that Ansaldo personnel need to be mobilized to site as soon as possible to assist in overcoming the current glut of problems that we are encountering. It is also advisable to mobilize a service specialist from Paxman to inspect the BSDG.\n\n\u25e6 Unit I turning gear is deteriorating on a daily basis, today we are at 28R.PM down from 38RPM last night.\n\n\u25e6 Balkan third party diesel mechanics suspect an injector problem with the BSDG.\n\n\u25e6 I have again strongly advised Balkan Energy that a combustion engineer is required on site.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s parenthetical references have been replaced by footnotes in order to include the description of the exhibit provided by Respondent.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 45(i), citing Exhibit R-31 : \"E-mail exchange between J.D.

The Claimant's Position\n--------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Power Station was capable of generating power on 1 November 2008, subject only to final testing and commissioning on 28 October 2008, which it claims it was ready for.338 However, the Claimant contends that it was unable to complete the commissioning within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date (March 2008) due to the alleged breaches of the PPA by the Respondent.339\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachments 121, 124.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 332-336.\n\nii. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Power Station was not ready for final testing and commissioning in October 2008 and, thus, was not ready to generate power on 1 November 2008.340 In support of its assertions in this regard, the Respondent makes reference to Balkan US\u2019s pleadings and testimony in the ProEnergy Litigation and the e-mail exchanges between representatives of BEL. and ProEnergy, quoted above. The existence and authenticity of these documents are not disputed by the Claimant.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 23, Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 61-65.\n\n*Balkan US\u2019s Pleadings and. Testimony in the ProEnergy Litigation*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the Balkan US's pleadings and testimony in the ProEnergy Litigation show that \"the Power Station could not have been ready for Final Testing and Commercial Operation as of October 28, 2008, regardless of whether there was grid connectivity or not\".341 Consequently, the Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to commission the Power Station in 2008.\n\nStatement of Defense, para, 44.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that, notwithstanding the Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration that Ghana is to blame for its inability to complete the commissioning within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date (March 2008), \"Balkan\u2019s unwavering position in the ProEnergy Litigation, some three years later, was just the opposite, that ProEnergy could, and should, have completed the commissioning of the Power Station by March, 2008, pursuant to the terms of its contract with Balkan.\"342 In support, the Respondent relies on the documents it obtained as a result of the US District Court\u2019s Orders dated 7 February and 6 June 2011, drawing attention to certain contradictions between the Claimant\u2019s pleadings in this arbitration and the position it took in the ProEnergy Litigation.343 The Respondent emphasizes that, in the ProEnergy Litigation, Balkan US \"details ProEnergy\u2019s failures at length,\" failures which it argues \"are wholly inconsistent with the claim... that it is entitled to [T]oiling [F]ees from November 1. 2008 forward and that the Barge was ready for Final Testing and Commissioning as of October 28, 2008\".344 In particular, according to Balkan US in the ProEnergy Litigation, the stationary rotor blades of one of the two turbines essential for operation of the Power Station were damaged after ProEnergy unsuccessfully tried \"for the one hundred and second time\" to start the generator.345 Balkan US further argued that \"[t]hese stationary blades will have to be replaced which means that the entire turbine housing will have to be disassembled and the rotor pulled\", costing approximately USD 4 million.346\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 55; *see* Exhibit R-8: \"Deposition of Gene E.

We\u2019ve got people showing up on this job site that,.. have never even worked for ProEnergy\".349 With respect to the pipes leading from the fuel tanks, Mr. Elders testified that \"ProEnergy disassembled it, reassembled it wrong - we spend about six weeks... trying to start this barge with the fuel going through the wrong side\"350 According to Elders, after ProEnergy left the job site in November 2008, Balkan had to go back and correct ProEnergy\u2019s work on multiple systems.351\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 46; *see* Exhibit R-7: \u201fDeposition of Phillips David Elders, *ProEnergy Services, LLC* e. *Balkan Energy Co.,* No. 09-4026\", at 34:9-18; 36:14-37:2; 38:22-39:6; 44:13-45:4; 48:13-21; 127:3-132:21.; 148:3-149:9; 1.59:18-160; 13; 183:21-184:24; 189:23-190:11; *see also* R-8: \"Deposition of Gene E.

Disputed Facts**\n---------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nOn 2 March 2009, the Claimant professes to have run a successful test of FSNL on Turbine 1, and on Turbine 2 on 12 July 2009.366 The Claimant asserts that, on 9 July 2009, Ansaldo certified that the milestone of FSNL had been reached, albeit \"without electrical grid connectivity\".367 In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant further clarifies that it was never able to complete full mechanical testing at FSNL due to the lack of grid connectivity, since, as certified by Ansaldo, \"you could not conduct the type of continuous commissioning activities that mechanical testing at FSNL entailed using the Black Start Generator on the Barge\".368\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 224, 258.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 260; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 157: \"Ansaldo letter re: Full Speed No Load\".\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 61.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates its claim that that grid connectivity was available to BEL as early as July 2008.369 It also notes that, according to the Respondent's expert, Peter Fairhurst, it is possible, and indeed appropriate, to run an FSNL without grid connectivity using the Black Start Generator.370 The Respondent goes on to state that, even if the Claimant indeed achieved FSNL for the Turbines, which Respondent disputes, it emphasizes that \"running a turbine at [FSNL] does not demonstrate that it is possible to excite the generator to rated voltage or that the generators themselves are in operating condition or able to generate voltage or that a myriad of other mechanical, and electrical systems are operational.\"371 In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s \"[l]abelling [of FSNL] as a \u2018milestone\u2019... is a clever misnomer.\"372 In particular, the Respondent draws support for its challenge of the Claimant\u2019s assertion that it reached FSNL on the Turbines from the test results and letters from Ansaldo submitted by the Claimant, which the Respondent contends are \"incomplete\", non-compliant with the international Organization for Standardization\u2019s testing standards (**\"ISO Testing Standards\"**) for FSNL tests, \"and were not approved or witnessed by the Government pursuant to Clause 6.1 of the PPA.\"373\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 44, fn. 13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 134.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 61.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 62.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 63, referring to Exhibit C-38, Attachment 193: \"GT2 Full Speed No Load\", Attachment 194: \"GTI Full Speed No Load\".\n\n247.\n\nWith respect to the testing of Turbine 1, the Respondent submits that Ansaldo\u2019s 12 October 2009 \"activity report\", which certified that Turbine 1 had achieved FSNL, was drafted \"seven months after the [FSNL] test was performed in March 2009, and contains no contemporaneous testing data from the DCS\".374 The Respondent also contends that this report does not outline Ansaldo\u2019s \"performance standards against which to measure the test results\"; \"has no corroboratory signatures by Ansaldo or Balkan, nor any information as to who at Ansaldo conducted the test of his or her qualifications to do so\"; that \"the terms and conditions of this performance test were not determined by the [P]arties\"; and that \"the Government received no advance notice of' the test.\"375 The Respondent further emphasizes that this report notes that the \"Gas turbine trip[ped] after about 50 [seconds] at nominal speed\".376 Furthermore, the Respondent draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the Claimant\u2019s factual assertion in the ProEnergy Litigation that the rotor blades of Turbine I were irreparably damaged by ProEnergy, and that \"[t]hose blades, according to Balkan, had not been replaced at the time of this test.\"377\n\nStatement of Defense, para, 64.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 64.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 66,\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 66, referring to Exhibit R-4: \"Plaintif's First Amended Petition, *Balkan Energy Co. v.

No. 09-01944\", para. 5.17(1).\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent draws further support for its counter-assertion that the Claimant did not successfully test the Turbines at FSNL from the report by ABB dated 30 June 2009, wherein ABB certified that Turbine 2 had successfully been tested at FSNL.378 The Respondent asserts that this report shows that the Claimant \"had removed various inhibitors to prevent the turbine from tripping so as to artificially reach [FSNL]\" and that \"various inhibitors in the [Turbine] 1 software were \u2018blocked\u2019 and that there were differences between the software for [Turbines] 1 and 2 (although they are the exact same turbines and should have the same testing standards).\"379 In this regard, the Respondent submits that the removal of the inhibitors contravenes ISO Testing Standards.380 Furthermore, the Respondent relies on excerpts of \"notable statements in the report\"381 in support of its assertion that the Claimant and \"ABB were able to reach [FSNL] only by disabling key aspects of the logic software and removing various inhibitors that would have tripped the [Turbine 2] and shut it down prior to its achieving [FSNL]\".382\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 65.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 65.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 65, referring to Exhibit R-51: \"\u00cfSO3977-8, \"Gas turbines - Procurement -Part. 8: Inspection, testing, installation and commissioning\", \u00a7 6.3.11.\n\n*See* Statement of Defense, para, 69.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 70; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 132.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant never tested the Turbines at FSNL, as was in fact conceded by one of the Claimant's witnesses383 The Respondent contends that what the Claimant had achieved was \"but a first step in the much longer process of other necessary activities to be undertaken.\"384 The Respondent finally submits that these activities were never performed.385\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 4, 91:12-16; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 131.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 135 referring to C-38, Attachment 157.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 135.\n\n250.\n\nWith respect to the functioning of other critical systems on the Barge, the Respondent similarly asserts that the Claimant provides no \"documentation demonstrating that critical mechanical, electrical, and safety systems were, or are today, completed or successfully tested as per the Operating Parameters set forth in the PPA\", including \"the DCS System, the Fuel Handling System, the Relay Protection System, the Water Cooling System, the Fire Protection System, the Barge Cathode Protection System, and a. whole host of other systems essential to the operation of the Power Station.\"386\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 73.\n\n**G. The Letter of Credit**\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n**(a) Clause 11.7 of the PPA**\n------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe PPA defines \"Letter of Credit\" as \"an irrevocable standby letter of credit provided to BE[L] by [Ghana] as provided in Clause 11.7 and also in the form set forth in the Tenth Schedule.\"387 Clause 11,7 of the PPA provides as follows:\n\nIn order to provide BE[L] assurance of payments as will be required by its lenders, [Ghana] shall on or before the Effective Date provide a Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the sum of the Tolling Fees and fuel Cost payable over sixty (60) days based on the then current Contracted Capacity (subject to adjustment each Contract Year to reflect the then current Contracted Capacity) and assuming that the Power Station is operated at 125 MW each day for such sixty (60) day period (as adjusted from time to time the \"Letter of Credit Amount\"), issued by a financial institution reasonably acceptable to BE[L], as security for the timely payment of all sums due to BE[L] hereunder from [Ghana], [Ghana] covenants and agrees to provide BE[L] no later than (30) days prior to the expiration of any existing letter of Credit a replacement Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the then current Letter of Credit amount. BE[L] shall be entitled to draw upon any Letter of Credit without further notice to [Ghana] for any payment due to BE[L] from [Ghana] that is overdue for at least fifteen (15) days. [Ghana] further covenants and agrees that upon the draw of funds by BE[L] under any Letter of Credit provided hereunder, [Ghana] shall provide to BE[L] an additional letter of Credit equal to the amount drawn under any such Letter of Credit. In the event that [Ghana] fails to arrange issuance and funding of any Letter of Credit required hereunder within fifteen (15) days after the obligation to provide any such Letter of Credit to BE[L] arises, such failure shall be deemed to be a flagrant disregard of its obligations hereunder and BE[L] shall be entitled (following prior written notice to [Ghana]) to (i) suspend deliveries of electricity hereunder until [Ghana] has cured the breach of its obligations under this Clause 11.7 and (ii) draw down the outstanding balance of any Letter of Credit previously provided to BE[L] by [Ghana]; provided that, so long as [Ghana] is current with all payments due to BE[L] under this Agreement, BE[L] shall not be entitled to suspend deliveries of electricity or draw down further amounts under any Letter of Credit, within sixty (60) days of the date the obligation to provide such Letter of Credit arises, or (ii) in the case of each replacement or additional Letter of Credit, within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date the obligation to provide any such Letter of Credit arises, then the provisions of Clause 17.1 shall apply. Subject to the laws of Ghana all payments made by [Ghana] shall be made free and clear of and without any deduction for or on account of any set-off, counterclaim, tax or otherwise and all such payments will be increased by the [Government of Ghana] as required in section 11.2, above.\n\nClause 1, Definition of Terms, PPA.\n\n**(b) Chronology of the Letters of Credit Issued by the Respondent**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nOn 24 August 2007, Stanbic Bank issued a Letter of Credit to the Claimant.388 On 28 January 2009, the Respondent issued a new Letter of Credit.389 On 23 January 2010, the Respondent issued a renewed Letter of Credit.390\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 290; *see* Agreed Chronology of Events, at 1.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 293; *see* Agreed Chronology of Events, at 2.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 297; *see* Agreed Chronology of Events, at 3.\n\n**2.

Timothy Everhart and William BERKENBILE AND TO THE SEIZURE OF THE DCS FROM THE PROJECT SITE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Undisputed Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n257.\n\nMr. Timothy Everhart - an employee at BEL - was arrested by Ghanaian authorities on 9 January 2010 on suspicion that, he was stealing the DCS from the Project Site.405 He was subsequently released on 11 January 2010.406 Mr. William Berkenbile - a mechanic for ProEnergy Services LLC (BEL\u2019s subcontractor) - was also arrested and the DCS was seized by Ghanaian authorities \"at about the same time.\"407\n\nStatement of Claim paras. 302, 307.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 302; Not disputed, by the Respondent in its submissions; *see also* Agreed Chronology of Events, at 3.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 305. Not disputed by the Respondent in its submissions, but not mentioned in the Agreed Chronology of Events.\n\n258.\n\nThe circumstances of and reasons for the arrests and seizure are however subject to dispute between the Parties.\n\n**2. Disputed Facts**\n---------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**408\n----------------------------------\n\nThe Timothy Everhart arrest is addressed by Claimant in its facts section at paras. 302-307 of its Statement of Claim and paras. 144-145 of its Reply.\n\n259.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Mr. Everhart was \"stripped to his underwear, placed in jail and not allowed to contact attorneys or have contact with the American Embassy for in excess of 48 hours\".409 The Claimant states that it reported these alleged violations to Ghana\u2019s Attorney General, but that \"[d]espite almost two years of investigation... Mr. Everhart still has not been exonerated.\"410 The Claimant further asserts that a representative of the US Embassy in Ghana made three unsuccessful attempts to visit Mr. Everhart while he was incarcerated, and even \"filed a formal protest letter with Ghana after which they were allowed access to see him.\"411 The Claimant also asserts that after he was released from jail two days after his arrest, Mr. Everhart was not permitted to travel and was investigated by the Ghanaian authorities for theft of computer equipment on the Project Site,412 The Claimant\u2019s alleges that Mr. Everhart was only arrested because the Claimant had decided to institute arbitration proceedings against the Respondent.413 In support of this assertion, the Claimant relies on Mr, Adama\u2019s crossexamination, which in the Claimant\u2019s view revealed that, at the time he (Mr. Adama) went to the site to arrest Mr. Everhart, he did not know who owned the alleged stolen items and that he had no evidence that the items had been removed without the consent of relevant authorities of Ghana414\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 302.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 302.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 303.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 304.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 95,\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para, 95; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 6, 131:15-155:9.\n\n260.\n\nWith respect to the arrest of Mr. Berkenbile and seizure of the DCS on the Barge by the Ghanaian authorities,415 the Claimant contends that these actions on the part of the Respondent *\"were* likewise baseless\", as the DCS was \"either owned by or in the rightful possession of BE[L]\u201f.416 From the Claimant\u2019s point of view, the seizure constitutes the torts of conversion and trespass to chattels under Ghanaian law.417\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 305.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras, 304, 307.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 97.\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**418\n------------------------------------\n\nThe Timothy Everhart arrest is addressed by Respondent in its argument section, under the headings \"False Arrest\" and \"Conversion and Trespass\", at paras. 160-168 of its Statement of Defense, paras. 1571.58 of its Rejoinder, and para. 196 of its Post-Hearing Submission.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent does not expressly deny that the arrests and seizure of the DCS took place, but offers several arguments why the Claimant\u2019s claims for false arrest and conversion and trespass should be dismissed, as described below under the Parties\u2019 Legal Arguments.\n\n**I. The Tribunal\u2019s Assessment and Consideration of the Facts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Negotiation of the PPA**\n---------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe facts noted above concerning the negotiation of the PPA, as well as the Parties\u2019 positions in that respect, shed an important light on the business BEL and the Government of Ghana intended to undertake and the terms on which they agreed to operate. Despite the massive amount of documentation and the extensive pleadings submitted in this arbitration, it is important not to lose sight of the essential commitments and undertakings of the parties during the negotiation of the PPA and the context in which these commitments and undertakings were made.\n\n263.\n\nThe MOU signed by the Parties on 16 May 2007 clearly reflects what the Parties expected to achieve by means of this understanding. While Ghana needed some mitigation of the acute power shortage that was affecting the country at the time, the Claimant was prepared to commit itself to make the Barge operational in a short period of time.. To this end BEL proposed to make the Barge operational within ninety days from the execution of the PPA. This proposal outbid all other' interested competitors for the project who had estimated longer periods to bring the Barge into operation. The Government of Ghana accepted BEL\u2019s proposal.\n\n264.\n\nThe proposals made by Mr. Elders were not based on theoretical considerations but followed a very specific technical study contained in the \"Master Energy Plan and Report of Site Survey\", submitted to the Ministry of Energy on 14 May 2007, which was followed on 24 May 2007 by a detailed Technical and Commercial Proposal. The ninety-day undertaking for the refurbishment and commissioning of the Barge is prominent in this proposal, as were a number of milestone events later to be included in the Third Schedule to the PPA.\n\n265.\n\nIt did not take long for the negotiations of the PPA to reach the crucial element of the fees that would be paid for accomplishing this project. The Tribunal notes that on 14 June 2007 Mr, Elders submitted to the.Ministry of Energy a \"Tariff Analysis Report\", to be followed shortly thereafter by the Letter of Intent provided to him by the Ministry of Energy proposing a lower tariff rate for the Tolling Fees. At Mr. Elders request, on 21 June 2007, the Ministry of Energy provided him with a letter of intent which proposed a lower tariff rate for the Tolling Fees.\n\n266.\n\nAs front that point the negotiations were largely concerned with the question of Tolling Fees evidencing the disagreement of the parties about this element and other technical aspects of the project. As has been noted, a meeting was held on 11 July 2007 between Messrs. Elders and Amo and Ghana\u2019s President at the time, Mr, John Agyekum Kufuor, seeking to unblock the obstacles that had impeded the progress of those negotiations. \u00c0 further conversation was apparently held between the President and Mr. Phillips which the Claimant asserts was key to his decision, to make the necessary investment, for undertaking the project. Although there is no record or other evidence of these conversations, except for the witness statements of the Claimant\u2019s officials concerned, and there are no comments by the Respondent on these conversations, the fact that the PPA and related agreements were signed on 27 July 2007 indicate that the negotiations were in the end successful. The Effective Date of the PPA was agreed as 31 October 2007.\n\n267.\n\nIn. the course of the negotiations on the PPA, BEL was registered as a locally incorporated company to comply with Ghana\u2019s legal requirements. This fact, together with the legal opinions issued by Ghana\u2019s Minister of Justice and Attorney General on 26 October 2007, is at the heart of the legal aspects of this dispute and as such will be examined further below'.\n\n268.\n\nWhile the Claimant suggests that the Respondent had hidden motives to delay the negotiations and to impede their successful conclusion, nothing in the factual record of this case so confirms or implies. In the Respondent\u2019s view such difficulties arose from the economic considerations underlying the various proposals. The facts discussed lead the Tribunal to believe that the latter was indeed the case. If there were other motives, these have not been supported by the evidence and are hence more a matter of speculation than of established fact.\n\n269.\n\nDespite the difficulties the negotiations faced, in the end the agreed PPA established two sets of clearly defined obligations. For BEL it was to lease the Power Station from Ghana and have it ready for commercial operation, with the capacity to deliver 125 MW to the National Grid, within ninety days from the Effective Dale of the PPA. A cost of USD 40 million was estimated at the time for this undertaking, with the additional important commitment that BEL would bear all costs of the commissioning. In addition, BEL would convert the Power Station into a combined cycle power plant, at the estimated cost of USD 100 million,. Other stages of the project included the addition of two more combined cycle barge mounted systems at an estimated cost of USD 250 to 300 million, investment in infrastructure for the supply of natural gas and BEL\u2019s commitment to provide all the required fuel to the Project and pay for its cost.\n\n270.\n\nGhana\u2019s responsibilities were equally clearly established. It would ensure that all necessary site electricity was provided; would construct, install and connect the transmission line and relay protection equipment to connect the Power Station to the National Grid, with BEL providing for adequate transmission cables to the point of interconnection with Ghana\u2019s national electricity grid; and \"take and pay\" for all electricity generated by the Power Station during the term of the Agreement. Governmental approvals, administrative permits and other regulatory requirements would be ensured by Ghana.\n\n271.\n\nAn important aspect of the PPA was the Parties\u2019 commitment to ensure mutual collaboration to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations. As an additional safeguard it was further provided that should BEL be unable to commence testing of the Power Station as a result of Ghana\u2019s failure to provide an adequate transmission line and interconnection facilities for the Power Station, Ghana would be obligated to commence paying Tolling Fees to BEL, in accordance with para, 11.9 of the PPA.\n\n272.\n\nAs is only too evident from the Parties\u2019 submissions in this case, the performance of each other in respect of these reciprocal commitments and obligations has been disputed. While the Claimant maintains that the reason why the project could not be completed on time was because of Ghana's failure to provide for the necessary electricity and power lines and other elements of non-performance, Ghana contends that all the assurances given by BEL in the course of the negotiations turned to be untrue as the latter had neither the capability or the experience to do the job. The Tribunal\u2019s task is to find out, on the facts of the case, which party is right or wrong in its contentions and attach the corresponding legal consequences, which will be addressed further below'.\n\n**2. The Facts Concerning the Power Station and the Barge**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nOf the facts noted there are two that stand out as crucial for the resolution of the dispute between the Parties. The first concerns the point where the respective Parties have the responsibility for connecting the Barge to the national grid. It will be seen that the point where the Claimant\u2019s responsibility for the connection ends and that of the Respondent begins has been the matter of important debate. The second question concerns which Party has the obligation to pay for the RTU, MicroSCADA system and the DSC. While they are located on the Barge, these systems are also important for the proper functioning of the equipment in the Substation.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimant contends that final commissioning cannot be achieved without the final connection to the G-NITS as it is the essential source of power for the operation of the turbines and the their testing. The Respondent, on the other hand, is of the view that the 161 kV electrical system must be fully operational before the Power Station can be connected to the Grid as it is the key element for allowing power to be exported from the Barge and energy imported into it, as required. The allocation of the respective responsibilities will be examined further below,\n\n**3. The Facts Concerning the Commissioning Steps**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on the steps that must be followed to achieve proper commissioning of the Power Station. The four \"milestones\" identified by the Claimant do not appear objectionable, and this is also true of the more detailed enumeration set out in Mr. Brinckerhoff\u2019s Expert Report and submitted by the Respondent. Both are descriptive of the sequence of events that are necessary to finalize commissioning. However, in the view of the Tribunal, what matters is not so much how many milestones have been achieved but the end result: that is to say whether the point has been reached at which the Power Station is generating the required amount of electricity and, subject to interconnection, ready to deliver to the National Grid. As has become evident from the facts discussed above the Power Station was not ready to generate and deliver the required amount at the date established in the PPA, and it is still not ready to do so, even though some of the required steps may have been achieved.\n\n276.\n\nA related issue is whether the Parties were required to cooperate to achieve the final point of commissioning, whatever that might have been. While the Claimant maintains that the standards of conduct between owner and contractor to this end identified by Mr. Badger are inapplicable in this case because BEL had no obligations in this respect and the Respondent had no right to participate in the commissioning process, the Tribunal must recall that one of the essential elements of the PPA, as noted above in respect of the negotiation process, was the Parties\u2019 commitment to ensure mutual collaboration to achieve the objectives of the Agreement and the performance of their respective obligations. That the Parties should work in isolation from each other does not seem to be consistent with their commitments under the PPA.\n\n277.\n\nThe facts relating to the Turning Gear and First Fire of the Turbines as the preliminary commissioning steps are not difficult to establish. It is not disputed that such steps were attained in the course of 2008 although the precise dates are not entirely clear. But what matters is to establish whether these steps led ultimately to the steps necessary to reach the required operational capacity.\n\n278.\n\nThe answer to this question appears to be in the negative. The Respondent\u2019s contention is that First Fire was attained for a very short period of time, estimated in the seconds or minutes, and that this was done by manipulating certain functions of the control systems that were essential for a proper attainment of the steps to follow, including the closely related stage of FSNL. The Tribunal considers that the contention of the Respondent is convincing having regard to the record of evidence chronicling the many difficulties that key pieces of equipment experienced. The evidence available shows that critical systems such as the Turbines, DCS, fuel tanks, 161kV GIS switchgear, transformer and relay protection devices had all been affected at one time or other by serious problems in their functioning. Given these shortcomings it is clear to the Tribunal that it would not have been possible to attain the steps required in a technically reliable manner, as will be discussed below.\n\n**4. The Facts on the Availability of Site Electricity**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThis is another aspect in respect of which the Parties have diametrically opposed views. The main issues are whether site electricity, i.e. the required capacity that ought to be supplied, was available, whether this was available at the appropriate time, and above all, whether in the end the commissioning process was negatively impacted and made more costly.\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that although the Claimant has made contradictory assertions in some documents, submissions or depositions, with particular reference to Mr. Elders certification in 2007 that electricity' had been supplied at the required voltage and frequency, there are also facts that point to the difficulties the Claimant faced in this connection. The Tribunal finds the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the supply of electricity was intermittent and was cut off for periods of hours and days, and its claim that generators had to be purchased to deal with this problem, io be credible, it is a situation which is not surprising in a rural setting and in remote villages of a developing country.\n\n281.\n\nWhether the capacity supplied was adequate is also disputed, but there can be no doubt that the difficulties encountered had a negative effect on the commissioning process and indeed increased its costs. It is difficult to establish for how long this effect lasted but it can be safely noted that it did not extend beyond the point in time at which the generators became fully operational. Thus, it can safely be assumed that the following steps in the commissioning process could not have been impeded by this factor.\n\n**5. The Turbines Mechanical Testing at FSNL**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL was not successful. The record is sufficiently clear as to the problems that plagued the rehabilitation of the equipment and its operation. The delivery of supplies was estimated to take up to 30 months and the rehabilitation would take until 2011, the dates varying for each turbine. The costs of rehabilitating were also estimated to be significant. Among other factors compounding these difficulties was the question whether liquid fuel should be used for the power generation, and if so which kind and price, or whether natural gas should be used instead.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that in the circumstances the certification made in 2009 by Ansaldo as to the turbines having completed the FSNL milestone is unrealistic, particularly if taken together with the Claimant\u2019s complaint that grid connectivity was not available. It must also be noted that after the Claimant asserted that it had attained that milestone, it later conceded that it had not attained the milestone because of the alleged lack of grid connectivity.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent, however, has argued that the transmission line was only necessary to attain the later milestone of FSFL, and that testing at FSNL could have been achieved using the Black Start Generator but that this could not be done because of the state of disrepair of the turbines. As this discussion is closely related to the issue of grid connectivity, this aspect of the dispute will be examined next in the light of the facts.\n\n**6. The Facts Concerning Grid Connectivity**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe state of the connection and transmission lines to the Essiama and Elubo substations has been also much debated. It is not disputed, however, that as at present the Elubo substation cannot receive back-feed from the Barge. The Parties also disagree on whether the Essiama. substation can take the full load from the Barge or whether the Elubo transmission line must be operational for this to happen.\n\n286.\n\nThe fact that these lines were not fully operational for the needs of the project at the time work on the Power Station was supposed to be progressing, particularly because of the dense tree overgrowth that interfered with the route of the lines, is well established. Photographic evidence in the record is convincing to this effect. Notwithstanding maintenance work occasionally carried out by the Respondent the problem appears to have endured. That the Essiama line was energised in mid 2008 is also a well established fact, but the question that remains is whether this was enough for handling the output of the Barge, assuming that this was available,\n\n287.\n\nIt is important to note in this connection that, in accordance to the Respondent\u2019s information, the Essiama Transmission Line to Tower 3 was in fact energised on 8 August 2008, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of this assertion. Whether this was enough to connect the Barge to the National Grid, as stated by the Respondent, is open to some doubt, in part because the capacity of the line was at the limit of the Barge\u2019s maximum output and in part because, according to the Claimant, there were some technical issues concerning the backfeeding of the Elubo substation, The ability of the Elubo Transmission Line to deliver the required power and to handle the Power Station output is also somewhat doubtful. The Claimant\u2019s argument that both substations should be coordinated in their operation is convincing as otherwise there would have been no need for two transmission lines.\n\n**7. The Commissioning of the RTU/Micro Scada System**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nIt is also a well established fact in the record that BEL, through ProEnergy acting as its subcontractor, requested several proposals from other parties to commission the RTU system on the Barge. From the exchanges with these other parties it appears that the work to be performed did not involve merely repair or even upgrading of the system but that an entirely new system would have to be installed with the corresponding cost. While in the \"Grid Connection Process Agreement\", concluded between the Claimant and the Respondent at a meeting held on 17 June 2008, the latter was to use its contacts to seek a proposal from ABB, it was nonetheless established that BEL would be responsible for this commissioning.\n\n289.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Grid Connection Process Agreement (R-52) concluded between the Claimant and the VRA provided for the Claimant\u2019s obligations as to the commissioning of the RTU. These obligations were expressed as follows: \"upon completion and review of the above pre-energization check list, **Balkan Energy will contract an Independent Third Party Testing Company to perform a complete installation, engineering and commissioning overview** : this will include review of the VRA Audit. Upon completion of the third party inspection, Balkan Energy and the VRA must agree jointly in acceptance and connection of the 163 kV Transmission Line to the Barge\". Although the drafting of these terms was not as clear as would have been desired it is nonetheless reasonable to conclude that while the commissioning of the RTU was the Claimant\u2019s responsibility, this would be subject to an audit by the VRA and the process as a whole would then be further subject to the supervision of the contracted third party. It must also be noted that the text of the Agreement does not refer to the Respondent\u2019s obligation to seek a proposal from ABB.\n\n290.\n\nBeginning in October 2008 BEL came to the view that payment for the system was Ghana\u2019s responsibility and that prior discussions with third parties to undertake such work were only meant to appraise itself of the scope of the work so that the Claimant could appropriately coordinate with the Respondent. In its view the Grid Connection Process Agreement had provided for Respondent\u2019s contractors Forclum and Norlec for commissioning the new MicroSCADA system and that GridCo as the government operator of the National Grid was under the law of Ghana under the obligation to ensure and consequently pay for this commissioning.\n\n291.\n\nWhile the Grid Code promulgated in 2009 does contain this provision which imposes the obligation on GridCo,, it must be noted that this happened two years after the conclusion of the PPA, thus the terms of the Code are not dispositive of the issue under discussion. Even so the Claimant asserts that prudent industry practice and prior law still placed this obligation on Ghana at the time of the conclusion of the PPA, as reflected in the 2007 version of the Grid Code and its connection to the regulations passed in June 2008 drafted on the basis of that version. The fact remains, however, that the Grid Code was formally promulgated much later than the PPA and only became legally binding after the PPA has been concluded. It must also be noted, as the Respondent points out, that the Grid Code expressly states that it was not intended to alter pre-existing contractual obligations. Article 4.18 of the 2009 Grid Code in fact provides; \"The Grid Code shall apply to all such existing contracts insofar as the Grid Code does not impair the obligations arising from the existing contract.\"\n\n292.\n\nStill more important than the legal considerations is the actual discussion that took place between BEL and the third parties that would perform the work concerning the RTU system. The Respondent points out that the Claimant attempted to find a vendor for this work as soon as it assumed control of the Barge and never forwarded any of their proposals to the Respondent. Even the guidelines provided to ABB for this commissioning, which as noted were requested by intermediation of the Government, were drafted by the Claimant and, tellingly, provided that only the Claimant\u2019s listed personnel would be authorized to communicate with the subcontractor. Equally telling is the fact that ABB\u2019s proposal identified BEL as the \"Customer\". The Claimant asserts that this was only meant to facilitate the commissioning and that it volunteered to help with the costs but it never agreed that this task was within its responsibility. However, the fact remains that for all practical purposes it was the Claimant who appeared as the entity responsible for this mandate to subcontractors.\n\n293.\n\nThe facts thus point in the direction that it was the Claimant\u2019s responsibility to pay for the commissioning of the system. Yet, as the Respondent has also noted, the Claimant has provided no evidence that the work was completed or when, as it neither notified the Respondent that the RTU was installed and that connection to the National Grid was requested to complete the commissioning.\n\n294.\n\nThe Parties Slave also discussed the functions and requirements for the operation of the RTU/MicroSCADA system, particularly about its role in respect of the connection of the Power Station to the National Grid. There can be no doubt about the fact that this system is necessary for the appropriate operation of the connection to the National Grid as it would have been otherwise futile to include it in the works to be undertaken on the Barge and generally in the Grid Code and its background documents. The issue, however, is how decisive this factor is in ensuring that the commissioning of the Barge can be achieved. While the Claimant maintains that it is critical, the Respondent is of the view that it is preferable but not essential. The Respondent asserts that, in any event what is essential is that the 161kV electrical system on the Barge should be in place.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced by the Claimant\u2019s arguments that the RTU system is necessary for the proper functioning of the interconnection to the National Grid and that the commissioning of the Barge would have been more difficult to attain without it. It is equally convinced, however, that, as noted by the Respondent, for any such functions to be properly handled the 161kV electrical system must be available as otherwise it appears to be immaterial that the control center would be on the Barge, close to it in the Substation or far away because there would have been nothing to monitor or control. ft must be kept in mind that the RTU/MicroSCADA systems are monitoring and control devices for the connections to and from the Barge, the operation of which requires in the instant case the electrical output to monitor and control. But such an electrical system does not appear to have been completed and this would have in itself prevented the connection to the National Grid irrespective of the fact that the RTU was in place,\n\n296.\n\nThe Claimant also states that even if the RTU is commissioned, interconnection cannot occur unless \"both sides exchange (coordinate) ail of their separate 161 kV protective relay settings\",419 thus confirming that both the RTU and the 161 kV system are necessary to connect to the National Grid. The technical details submitted as Attachment 6 to Mr. MacDonald\u2019s affidavit420 demonstrate that the RTU 2,000 MicroScada is the source of automation for the GIS, which in turn is an essential element of the 161 kV electrical system. The same document also suggests that the RTU monitors not only the GIS but the whole Substation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 86.\n\nAt pp. 15-16, and in particular p. 16 *in fine.*\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that although Ansaldo recommended not to use the Black Start Generator for commissioning and insisted on the need for grid connectivity to this end, the validity of this opinion can be seriously put in doubt as the facts examined above suggest that the generator may well be capable of handling the commissioning tasks.\n\n**8. The Testing and Commissioning of the Barge at the End of 2008**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIn the course of the second half of 2008 it became noticeable that distrust had begun to characterize the relations between the Parties about the work each was supposed to perform. In July of that year the Respondent had written to BEL confirming that the Essiama Transmission Line was ready to be energised, while at the same time it. requested the Claimant to witness and sign-off the commissioning tests of the 161 kV equipment and protection relays that the Claimant was to make available for the final commissioning of the Barge and its connection to the National Grid. As noted, no answer was received to these requests. For its part, the Claimant informed the Respondent in October 2008 that the Power Station would be ready for Final Testing and Commissioning at the end of that month and would be ready to start generating power on 1 November 2008. This was to be followed by the connection of the Transmission Line from the National Grid to the Power Station so as to test all systems on the Barge and deliver power to the National Grid. As discussed above, it appears that the work on the 161 kV electrical system had not been completed at that time and in the Respondent\u2019s view was never completed.\n\n299.\n\nAnother major source of conflict was the bad relationship that had developed between BEL and its subcontractor ProEnergy, which ended up in serious allegations being made by the former against the latter in the litigation they were involved in before the US courts. The exchanges that had taken place between these two entities in 2008 are very illuminating on the issue whether the work on the Barge had been completed and was ready for final testing and commissioning. They show that, in spite of the assurances given by Ansaldo and other persons that the turbines had reached FSNL, ProEnergy believed that this had never happened, or if it had it was for not more than ten seconds, with multiple incidents of electrical and mechanical failures in the process.\n\n300.\n\nIt is a fact that the Power Station was not ready to deliver energy on 1 November 2008. While the Claimant asserts that commissioning could not be completed on time because of the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the PPA, the fact remains that what BEL had announced i.e. that the Barge was ready to deliver power on 1 November 2008 was not the case. Again on this matter the allegations made in the US litigation, just as the testimony provided in those proceedings, show that in BEL\u2019s view ProEnergy was Hable for repeated failures in the discharge of the work entrusted to it.\n\n**9. The Facts Concerning the Parties\u2019 Negotiations of 2009**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe discussion between the Parties continued into 2009 without any signs of improvement. The Claimant had invoiced the Respondent for an amount of Tolling Fees on 25 November 2008 and a meeting was held on 24 February 2009 to discuss this question and the commissioning at the Barge, but it did not go beyond the Respondent requesting the Claimant to withdraw the invoices and proposing a new plan for the Barge. Nevertheless an Inter-Ministerial Committee was set up to review the PPA and the commissioning process and a site visit was conducted. A further meeting was held on or about 12 July 2009 to discuss the question of FSNL, fuel supply and other matters, but no progress was made, as evidenced by the fact that on 7 August 2009 the Respondent again rejected the Claimant\u2019s invoices and denied the Claimant\u2019s entitlement to Tolling Fees. On the same day the Claimant delivered a notice of breach of the PPA and decided to draw upon the Letter of Credit.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position on the facts is that FSNL of Turbine 1 was attained on 2 March 2009 and of Turbine 2 on 12 July of that year, emphasizing that Ansaldo had certified this fact on 9 July 2009 and noting that this milestone had been achieved without electrical grid connectivity. The Tribunal must note in this respect that this contention confirms the fact discussed above that FSNL can be run without grid connectivity using the Black Start Generator, as the Respondent has argued, and that, in any event, as also noted, grid connectivity had been available much earlier, as asserted by the Respondent.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal must also state that it is skeptical about the value of Ansaldo\u2019s certification of these facts, as the letters submitted by Ansaldo do not allow concluding that the proper tests were conducted by qualified experts. Moreover, these tests were not approved or witnessed by the Respondent in accordance with the requirements of the PPA, as the Respondent has pointed out. The information available from the ProEnergy Litigation is also not helpful to support the Claimant\u2019s assertions. In the ProEnergy Litigation, the Claimant argued that the rotor blades had been irreparably damaged by the subcontractor, and, as noted further above, ProEnergy had adamantly expressed its conclusions that the turbines had never been fired at FSNL, and that it was prepared to so testify. In any event, if the turbines had been fired at all this has been for few seconds or minutes and after bypassing the technical requirements for reaching proper functioning of the turbines.\n\n**10. The Facts Relating to the Letter of Credit**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe facts concerning this other point of contention between the Parties are first that there was indeed an obligation for Ghana to make available a Letter of Credit to the Claimant under Clause 11.7 of the PPA, which would provide the necessary assurances to BEL\u2019s lenders. This obligation was satisfied by the Respondent on 24 August 2007 on Stanbic Bank issuing such a Letter, which was thereafter renewed in 2009 and 2010. The Letter of Credit under Clause 11.7 was for an amount equal to the sum of Tolling Fees and fuel cost payable over sixty days, on the basis of a. certain output of power and other requirements. It is also quite evident that absent such a power output, entitlement to Tolling Fees would become moot and the Letter of Credit would be deprived of its legal basis under the Contract. It has also been established above that the necessary power output was never attained as the Power Station could not be commissioned on time.\n\n305.\n\nThus the issue of the Claimant's complaints about the fact that BEL was not issued with a replacement Letter of Credit are inextricably linked to the question whether entitlement to Tolling Fees was properly established. Such entitlement required formal approval by the Respondent of the Claimant\u2019s invoices, which, as noted above, never happened since the Respondent rejected the invoices in 2009. The Tribunal must also note that under Clause 11.7 of the PPA, the consequences of a breach by the Respondent would be that the Claimant could draw on the existing Letter and, above all, that it would suspend the delivery of electricity. There was thus an express link between the purpose of the Letter of Credit and the delivery of power from the Barge. While the Claimant complains that it could not present the issuing bank with an undisputed bill signed by the Respondent, the fact is that the bill was indeed disputed. The Claimant complains that BEL\u2019s situation became more difficult when it switched from Stanbic Bank to Zenith Bank because a Letter of Credit was not unavailable and this resulted in the latter Bank freezing BEL\u2019s accounts in 2010. But this does not change the fact that the absence of power delivery and consequential loss of BEL\u2019s entitlement to Toiling Fees meant that the requirements for issuing the Letter of Credit could not be met. As noted by the Respondent it would otherwise have issued a false certification to the bank.\n\n306.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the facts, the dispute about whether renewals were issued in time, whether there were tacit waivers by the Claimant or whether the Claimant could not draw on the Letter of Credit because there was no such Letter, and therefore no damage could be caused, is moot in light of the incomestible fact that power delivery was unavailable and the fact that this gave rise to the legal consequences noted. The Respondent has also argued that as this is in any event an obligation under the PPA which it claims is void *ab initio,* there would be no obligation to enforce. The Tribunal shall examine the validity of the PPA below.\n\n**11. The Facts of the Arrests and Seizure of Equipment**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nIt is also an established fact, not denied by the Respondent, that Mr. Timothy Everhart was arrested by Ghanaian authorities on 9 January 2010 and later released on 11 January 2010. Mr. William Berkenbile, an employee of ProEnergy was also detained for questioning at about the same time. The stated reason for these arrests was the suspicion that the affected persons were involved in misappropriating the DCS from the Project Site.\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Mr, Everhart was treated in an undignified manner and not allowed to contact attorneys or the United States\u2019 Embassy for over two days. While there is no evidence of physical ill-treatment, the assertion that undignified treatment occurred can well be considered credible (as might be the case in many countries, developed and less developed). The U. S. Embassy was ultimately contacted and it appears that it had to file a formal protest with the Respondent to ensure proper access to the detainee. Subsequently to his release Mr. Everhart was not permitted to travel and was investigated about the alleged theft of computer equipment, procedures that in the Claimant\u2019s view have not yet resulted in his exoneration.\n\n309.\n\nWhile the Claimant alleges that the arrests took place because the Claimant had instituted arbitration proceedings, this would be difficult to establish. The arrests were undoubtedly related to the ongoing dispute between the Parties and the mutual accusations that were made at all levels. The fact, however, that these events coincided with the time arbitration proceedings were instituted does not allow the Tribunal to rule out the Claimant\u2019s allegations in this respect. As the DCS was BEL\u2019s property or BEL had the rightful possession of the equipment, in the Claimant's argument the seizure constitutes the torts of conversion and trespass to chattels under Ghanaian law, as will be discussed further below. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Mr,Everhart\u2019s moving the DCS from one place to another within BEL\u2019s leased domain was not justifiable cause for his arrest.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES\u2019 LEGAL ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant\u2019s Corporate identity**\n----------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nWhile the Respondent acknowledges that the Claimant in this arbitration purports to be BEL, it. asserts that BEL\u2019s corporate identity, and that of its parent companies, is unclear.421 For its part, the Claimant maintains that it was incorporated in Ghana on 16 July 2007.422\n\nThroughout Respondent\u2019s submissions, it refers to the Claimant as \"Balkan\".\n\nAgreed Chronology of Events, dated 26 March 2013 (**\"Agreed Chronology of Events\"**), at 1.\n\n311.\n\nDuring the negotiations that led up to the signing of the PPA, the Claimant represented to the Respondent that it was a company registered in the Netherlands.423At the 15 October 2010 hearing on jurisdiction in this arbitration, the Tribunal requested that the Claimant describe its relationship to the Balkan Group.424 On 5 November 2010, the Claimant submitted that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Balkan Energy Ltd. (UK) (**\"Balkan UK\"**), which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary' of Balkan US, \"a company incorporated in Texas, United States.\"425 The Claimant also explained that \"[a]t no stage have any of these entities been incorporated in the Netherlands.\"426 Similarly, the witness statements accompanying the Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim reiterate that it is a subsidiary of Balkan US, a company \"formed to bring private investment to developing countries with power generation needs\".427\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 6: Memorandum of Understanding signed by Phillip Eiders and representatives of Ghana\u2019s Ministry of Energy on 16 May 2007 (\"MOU\"); Statement of Defense, para. 9: The Respondent submits that BEL\u2019s identity \"is... one of the issues before the High Court of Ghana\", namely \"whether BE[L] was properly constituted, whether representations regarding its ownership were false, and whether Balkan fraudulently induced the Government to enter into the PPA by misrepresenting its ownership structure, capabilities, and ability to commission a power barge.\" The Respondent does not detail the findings by the High Court on those issues in its Rejoinder. In its Post-Hearing Submission, para. 7, the Respondent suggests that the Claimant \"has offered conflicting versions of its corporate structure to the Tribunal as well as to various courts in the United States and regulatory agencies\" and that the Claimant\u2019s \"7, 2013 submission to the Tribunal [Claimant\u2019s 7 June Letter] only added to the confusion, raising additional questions about the accuracy of Balkan\u2019s public filings.\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Answers io Questions Posed to the Parties by the Arbitral Tribunal at the Hearing of 15 October 2010, 5 November 2010 (**\"Claimant\u2019s 5 November 2010 Submission\"**), at 4; Statement of Defense, para. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s 5 November 2010 Submission, at 4; Statement of Defense, para. 5.\n\nExhibit C-38; Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, paras. 2, 6; Exhibit C-35: Witness Statement of Gene Phillips, para. 6.\n\n312.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, the Respondent submits that Balkan US is not registered with the records department of the Texas Secretary of State. The Respondent further submits that, when the Claimant was questioned about its corporate identity in a proceeding before the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (the **\"US District Court\"**), Claimant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Mitchell Madden, stated that Balkan US \"was never formally formed\".428 The US District Court subsequently concluded that Balkan US\u2019s \"existence is somewhat suspect considering that it held itself out as a Texas corporation in the case before this Court when in fact it was not legally formed.... [and that] Balkan\u2019s briefing has not remedied the Court\u2019s concerns regarding the existence of [Balkan US], but has further compounded the issue\"429\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 8; Exhibit R-1 \"Balkan Energy Limited (Ghana)\u2019s Brief in Opposition to the Government of Ghana\u2019s Supplemental Brief in Opposition to the Motion of Balkan Energy Limited (Ghana) to Intervene and for Reconsideration of the Court\u2019s February 7, 2011 Order, In re Government of Ghana, No. 11-9002\", at 2.\n\nStatement of Defense, fn. 3; Exhibit R-2: \"Order, Government of Ghana v, ProEnergy Services., LLC, No. 11 -9002, 2011 WL 2652755 (W.D.

First, the Claimant contends in its 7 June Letter that Syntek West transferred full ownership of Balkan UK to Balkan Wyoming in September 2007, whereas the UK annual returns filed by Balkan UK for 2009 and 2011 show that Syntek. West still owned Balkan UK. Second, the Claimant alleges that Balkan Wyoming transferred full ownership of Balkan UK to Balkan Nevada in 2008,432 whereas it also contends in a different document433 that the ownership was actually transferred to another entity, Balkan Energy LLP. Finally, the Claimant contends that EPC International Inc., company owned by Mr. Elders, held a 10% of Balkan Wyoming in 2007 and another of Balkan Nevada in 2009, whereas the Texas Franchise Tax reports between 2006 and 2012 do not reflect this ownership.434 The Respondent concludes that the Claimant\u2019s June 7 Letter has not remedied the concerns about BEL\u2019s corporate structure, but has rather compounded the issue.\n\nClaimant\u2019s 7 June Letter, p. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s 7 June Letter, Attachment IJ.7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s 10 July Letter, p. 5.\n\n317.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant reaffirms the fact that \"it has not offered inconsistent version of its ownership in this or any other proceedings\"435 but concedes the point made by the Respondent436 that \"Balkan UK. Financial Reporting, as found on-line, incorrectly stated tire history of Balkan UK\u2019s true corporate structure\", as apparently, \"the local agent failed to note the correct information in 2011\". The Claimant suggests that the \"unintentional \u2018discrepancies\u2019 only relate to the ownership of Balkan UK and *not* to the ownership of BEL\" [emphasis added by the Claimant].437\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 3.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s 10 July Letter.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 4; Appendices A-l, A-2 and A-3.\n\n318.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant \"has offered conflicting versions of its corporate structure to the Tribunal as well as to various courts in the United States and regulatory agencies\", and highlights that \"regardless of who Balkan\u2019s parent, grandparent or owners actually are, it is clear that, contrary to the representation contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (...) none of these Balkan entities had any prior experience in refurbishing a power plant, much less a power plant in Africa\".438\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 7-8.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the information regarding the corporate identity of the Claimant company is indeed confusing, as claimed by the Respondent. During the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the PPA, the Claimant asserted that BET was a company registered in the Netherlands. Following the hearing on jurisdiction the Claimant explained that the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Balkan US which it said was incorporated in the State of Texas. However, no records of the incorporation in Texas has so far been made available. It is also to be noted that, in the US proceedings, the US Court was informed that the company had not in fact been formally incorporated, and this led the US court to conclude that the situation was somewhat suspect. The information provided by the Claimant following the hearing on the merits shows that, at the time of the signing of the PPA in 2007, Balkan UK had Nevada, Texas and Wyoming corporate entities among its controllers. By 2008 this structure had changed to include several Nevada corporations and one Texas corporation as the owners of Balkan UK. Different information was included, apparently by mistake, in the UK financial reporting for 2009 and 2011.\n\n320.\n\nWhile this inconsistent information led. the US District Court to express skepticism about the real corporate ownership of the Claimant company, this Tribunal must note that BEL was incorporated in Ghana on 16 July 2007 pursuant to the requirement of Article 12 of the Ghana Energy Commission Act which required all companies wishing to obtain a license to supply bulk energy in Ghana to be incorporated in the country, and that BEL was registered under Ghana\u2019s Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) as a locally incorporated company.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes, as stated in the exposition of the facts concerning the negotiation of the PPA, that on 26 October 2007 the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Ghana issued two legal opinions that have a strong bearing on this dispute. The first opinion dealt with the issue whether the PPA involved an international business or commercial transaction, and the opinion was that this was clearly not the case as it \"involves a local company in a local transaction with the Government\". This was followed by another opinion in which the Attorney General stated that all acts, conditions and things required by the laws and Constitution of Ghana had been done, fulfilled and performed in the light of the Project Agreement concluded between the Parties.\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that it is an accepted fact by both Parties that Balkan UK is the parent company of BEL, The discussion about the Claimant\u2019s corporate identity relates rather to a step further above concerning who controls or owns Balkan UK. While this discussion has importance in the context of the validity of the PPA and whether this Contract should have been submitted to Parliamentary approval because of its alleged international character, a matter to be discussed further below, the fact is that for the purposes of this arbitration the Claimant is a Ghanaian corporate entity properly constituted. In addition, the Tribunal recalls that issues of jurisdiction were already decided in the Interim Award and hence the question of corporate identity is not an obstacle for the decision on the merits.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 Claims**\n--------------------------\n\n323.\n\nOn the basis of the facts examined and the Parties\u2019 different understandings about their meaning, the Parties have laid down their legal claims. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent breached its obligations under the PPA by providing inadequate or unreliable site electricity, failing to provide grid connectivity, and failing to install a new RTU / MicroSCADA on the Barge, which the Claimant argues, prevented it from completing the final testing and commissioning of the Power Station. The Claimant asserts that it is entitled to damages based on: (i) breach of contract, including incidental damages; (ii) breach of the Arbitration Agreement; and (ii) alternatively, based on unjust enrichment, fraud/deeeil, false attest and conversion/trespass.\n\n324.\n\nThe Respondent denies the claim of the Claimant for breach of contract on the following grounds: first, the PPA is void *ab initio* under Article 181(5) of the Constitution; and second, even if the PPA is enforceable, the Claimant is not entitled to any payments or damages under the terms of the PPA.439 According to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal finds that the PPA is valid and enforceable - which it contends it cannot by virtue of the Supreme Court Judgment of 16 May 2012 - the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to Tolling Fees under Clauses 11.4 and 119 of the PPA.440 Similarly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish that it is entitled to incidental damages relating to site electricity, grid connectivity, the RTU, or the Letter of Credit.441\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 114-168.\n\nStatement of Defense, para..121.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 136.\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that it is the Claimant that is in breach of the PPA for its failure to commission the Power Station and, accordingly, the Respondent presents two counterclaims: first, for breach of contract; and second, for fraud and misrepresentation.442\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 170-182.\n\n**C. Supreme court Proceedings in Ghana and the parties\u2019 Arguments on the Validity of the PPA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal shall consider now a key question of this arbitration, namely whether the PPA is valid and enforceable, a matter on which the Parties\u2019 have diametrically different views. To this end the Supreme Court proceedings in Ghana shall be examined first to be followed by the examination of the Parties\u2019 positions thereon, which in their aggregate set out the legal arguments surrounding this question. The discussion shall end with the Tribunal\u2019s findings and conclusions on the validity of the PPA.\n\n327.\n\nOn 25 June 2010, after the appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal and four days before the First Procedural Meeting between the Parties was scheduled to take place on 29 June 2010, the Respondent applied for and was granted an interlocutory injunction against the arbitral proceedings by the High Court of Justice (Commercial Division) in Accra, Ghana. The injunction restrained the Claimant from, *inter alia,* taking any further steps in the arbitration proceedings pending final determination of the suit before the Ghana High Court. The Respondent alleged, in its suit before the High Court, that the PPA and the arbitration clause, which is part of the PPA, are void for lack of prior Parliamentary approval.443 On 6 September 2010, the Ghana High Court issued a ruling confirming the Order and dismissing the Claimant\u2019s application for a stay of proceedings.444\n\nOrder for Interlocutory Injunction, 25 June 2010, High Court of Justice (Commercial Division); Claimant\u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-27.\n\nRuling, 6 September 2010, High Court of Justice (Commercial Division); Claimant \u2019s Answers, Exhibit C-41,\n\n328.\n\nOn 3 November 2010, the Respondent moved for an expedited reference of the constitutional issues involving the validity of the PPA to the Supreme Court of Ghana.445 The Claimant opposed the application.446 When the matter came before the Supreme Court, the Claimant again opposed the expedited reference.447 Upon the Supreme Court\u2019s granting of the expedited reference,448 the Respondent contends that the Claimant \"sought to further delay the briefing and oral argument of the matter before the Supreme Court\" and \"succejeded] in delaying the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the constitutional issue.\"449 Final argument was held on 20 March 2012, after which the Court adjourned the matter for judgment to 16 May 2012.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 12; Exhibit R-44: \"Motion of the Government of Ghana in the Superior Court of Judicature in the High Court of Justice (Commercial Division), BDC/32/30\".\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 1.2; Exhibit R-45: \"Affidavit in Opposition to Application Under Article 130(2) of the 1992 Constitution, In the Superior Court of Judicature in the High Court of Justice (Commercial Court), BDC/32/10\".\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 12; Exhibit R.-47: \"Notice by Interested Parties of Intention to Reply on Preliminary Objection, In the Superior Court of Judicature in the Supreme Court of Ghana, J5/34/2011\".\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 12; Exhibit R-48: \"Ruling, In the Superior Court of judicature in the Supreme Court of Ghana, J5/34/2011\"..\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 12; Exhibit R-49: \"Motion on Notice for Extension of Time within Which to File an Answer to Plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Case, In the Superior Court of Judicature in the Supreme Court, JS/34/2013\".\n\n329.\n\nWith respect to the procedure before the Supreme Court, the Claimant notes that \"except for the affidavits offered by counsel for the parties, no evidentiary hearing was held and, accordingly, no factual record was developed\".450\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para, 14.\n\n**2. The Supreme Court Judgment of 16 May 2012**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe Supreme Court referred two issues to itself:\n\n1. Whether or not the [PPA] constitutes an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.\n\n2. Whether or not the. arbitration provisions contained in clause 22.2 of the [PPA] constitutes an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.451\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 2, referring to Supreme Court Ruling of 2 November 2011.\n\n331.\n\nRegarding the first issue referred to it, the Supreme Court concluded that the PPA \"constitutes an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.\"452\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 40-41,\n\n332.\n\nWith respect to the second issue, the Supreme Court stated that the \"arbitration provisions contained in clause 22.2 of the [PPA] does not constitute an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution\".453 However, in the same paragraph, the Supreme Court went on to conclude that:\n\nAn international commercial arbitration draws its life from the transaction whose dispute resolution it deals with. We therefore have difficulty in conceiving of it as a transaction separate and independent from the transaction that has generated the dispute it is required to resolve.454\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 41 ; *see also* Claimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, paras. 3 5, 22.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 41 ; also quoted in Claimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 23.\n\n333.\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court remits the case to the High Court for its consideration in light of this interpretation of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.455 The Supreme Court also requests that Parliament enact a Bill indicating what modifications it wishes to make to Article 181(5) of the Constitution, stating that \"[t]his step would bring greater certainty and clarity to the law.\"456\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 41 ; also quoted in Rejoinder, para. 24.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 41.\n\n**3. The Nature of the PPA under the Constitution of Ghana**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nArticle 181(5) of the Constitution provides as follows:\n\nThis article shall, with the necessary modifications by Parliament, apply to an international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party as it applies to a loan.\n\n335.\n\nAt the outset, the Supreme Court found that the wording of the constitutional provision \"should not lead necessarily to the result that only agreements between entities resident abroad and the Ghana Government can be embraced within the meaning of the term.\"457 It went on to opine that the substance of the transaction rather than the form should prevail when the transaction is of \"such a clear international nature\", even if the party contracting with the Government is resident in Ghana.458\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 30.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 31.\n\n336.\n\nRegarding the meaning of \"international\" in Article 181(5), the Supreme Court found it necessary to combine \"both the *nature of the business or economic transaction* criterion and the *parties\u2019* criterion proposed by the plaintiff.\"459\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 31.\n\n337.\n\nThe Supreme Court then acknowledged the \"need to formulate a clear criterion for distinguishing transactions between the Government and Ghanaian entities that fall under Article 181(5) from others with Ghanaian entities which do not fall in the category of Article 181(5) despite their \"foreign connections.\"460 Noting that the examples given by the Claimant in its submissions illustrate \"a *reductio ad absurdum\",* it acknowledged that \"it would be impractical for Parliament to scrutinize and approve every single business transaction with international ramifications entered into by the Executive,\"461\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 31.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 34-35: At this stage of its analysts, the Supreme Court also rejected the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Article 181(5) of the Constitution was inoperative without legislative \"modifications\" on the part of Parliament, based on the *Faroe* precedent and on a purposive interpretation of the constitutional provision: \u2018The framers could have hardly intended that Parliament should be able to stultify their purpose of achieving transparency in the Executive\u2019s international business deals through simple inaction.\"\n\n338.\n\nThus, pursuant to a purposive interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court found that \"there is need to imply into Article 181(5) an understanding that only *major* international business or economic transactions are to be subject to its provisions\"; while noting that Parliament should exercise its legislative power in relation to article 181(5) and clarify which transactions are to be viewed as major.\"462\n\nSupreme. Court Judgment, at 34 (emphasis in the original).\n\n339.\n\nThe Court further elaborated on the reasons underlying its interpretation. As \"one of the values of the [Constitution] is the promotion of probity and accountability\",463 reading in the term \"major\" was in accordance with the objective purpose of the Constitution.464 Specifically, the Court explained that \"Parliamentary scrutiny of major transactions entered into by the Executive is likely to be a. powerful spur to probity in such transactions. That is why it is unlikely that the framers would have intended to give to Parliament the veto power implied in the defendants\u2019 interpretation of article 181 (5).\"465 At the same time, the framers of the Constitution could not have intended \"the obvious and foreseeable paralysis from overload in Parliament that would ensue from interpreting the provision as covering every single business or economic transaction with an international dimension\".466\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 35.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 36.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 36.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 36.\n\n340.\n\nReiterating that it was \"imperative\" that Parliament give \"greater certainty and clarity as to [the] categories of international business or economic transactions,\"467 the Supreme Court states that \"[i]n the interim, a certification from the Attorney-General [before a dispute has arisen] that an international business transaction to which the Government is a party is \u2018major\u2019 or not should be accorded great weight by the courts.\"468\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 36.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 37; *see also* Claimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, paras. 27, 38.\n\n341.\n\nThe Supreme Court then reads into the definition of an \"international\" transaction the requirement that the \"nature of the business which is the subject matter of the transaction... [have] a significant foreign element or the parties to the transaction (other than the Government) have a foreign nationality or reside in different countries, or in the case of companies, the place of their central management and control is outside Ghana\"469 with the word \u2018significant\u2019 said to denote the qualitative assessment necessary to make the determination, where the assessment is \"in relation to the purpose of article 181(5)\".470\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 37.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 37.\n\n342.\n\nWith respect to the purpose of Article 181(5), the Supreme Court opines that the subjective or objective purpose of the framers of the Constitution was not to subject: to Parliamentary approval \"transactions of ordinary commerce\".471 In applying this test for \"international business transaction\" to the PPA, the Supreme Court concludes that the PPA falls within the ambit of Article 181(5). The Court further states that it viewed the term \"transaction\" to mean \"a series of agreements or acts united by their purpose of attaining the project objective of the parties to it\".472 The Court also notes that it \"view[ed] the transaction in the round, without resorting technically to the piercing of the corporate veil doctrine\". The Court considers the transaction in question as \"a foreign investment by a US investor in a power generation project\"473 based on the cumulative effect of the following five circumstances: i) The PPA resulted from negotiations between a foreign investor (Mr. Elders) and the Government; ii) BEL is wholly-owned by a foreign entity; iii) the managing director of BEL is a foreigner, Mr. Elders, \"and control of the management of [this Ghanaian company] is in foreign hands\"; iv) the PPA contains an international arbitration clause; and v) the PPA contains other clauses \"usually associated with foreign transactions, such as the waiver of sovereign immunity\"474 and Clause 29.2 (containing an exemption from taxes and foreign exchange controls).\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 38; Claimant suggests this phrase \"[a]rguably refer[s] to ordinary commerce in Ghana,\" Claimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, fn. 28.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 39.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 39.\n\nSupreme Court Judgment, at 40.\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the PPA is legally valid. In this regard, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal should give no weight to the Supreme Court of Ghana\u2019s analysis of Article 181(5) of the Constitution and its impact on the PPA475 The Claimant also requests that the Tribunal reconsider the determination in its interim Award regarding the \"importance of and consideration to be given [to] the Ghanaian Supreme Court\u2019s determination of the substantive issues of the application of Article 181(5) of the Constitution of Ghana to the PPA\".476 The Claimant insists the PPA is not an international business transaction and that such a determination \"can only be made after a full evidentiary hearing on the merits\" by this Tribunal477\n\nClaimant's Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 56.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, paras. 17. Also, in para. 21: \"Alternatively, the Tribunal, while affording deference to the rulings of the Ghanaian courts, it should not [...] refer, rely upon or give weight to the determinations arising out of the Ghanaian court proceedings\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 37.\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis does not, take into account the totality of the facts and circumstances engaged in this dispute, as well as the conduct of the Parties478 The Claimant argues that Article 185(5) should not apply in the absence of enabling legislation from the Ghanaian Parliament, but rather, \"the analysis should be limited to the bright line approach originally announced by the Ghanaian Supreme Court in its *Faroe* opinion.\"479 The Claimant emphasizes that \"parties contracting with the Government of Ghana should not be held... to an after-the-fact scrutiny of the constitutionality of an agreement, acknowledged by the Government and prosecuted by the Government for years,\" as the uncertainty is due to the Respondent\u2019s failure to seek Parliamentary approval and to clarify the application of the constitutional provisions in question.480\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para, 32.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 32.\n\n345.\n\nIn the event that the bright line test of *Faroe* does not apply, the Claimant submits that the applicable test should be one of \"totality of the circumstances\".481 The Claimant explains that, as employed under U.S. law,482 this test involves \"the identification of multiple criteria that are then accorded relative weight based upon the underlying facts and circumstances\"483. Applying the \"totality of the circumstances test\" to the present case, the Claimant submits that \"this would involve consideration of Balkan\u2019s place of business and the place of the parties\u2019 performance under the agreement\"484 The latter are, according to the Claimant, \"well-known concepts with clear rules and standards of interpretation,\" most notably pursuant to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) (the **\"CISG\"**).485 In particular, the Claimant asserts that \"there is overwhelming cognizance that the place of business is where the centre of the business activity directed to the participation is located.\"486\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 33; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 34. The Claimant explains that under U.S. law, this test is employed in anti-suit injunction applications.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 34. The Claimant gives example of weighing of factors in the case *Hellenic Lines.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 35 referring to Article 10 CISC and acknowledging Ghana is a signatory to the CISG but has not ratified it yet.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 35 (without emphasis in the original), citing Allison E. Butler, \"Interpretation of \u2018Place of Business\u2019: Comparison between provisions of the CISC (Article 10) and Counterpart Provisions of the Principles of European Contract Law\" [full citation not provided].\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning \"does not provide a definitive criterion io employ in analyzing the facts presented by this case\".487 In this regard, the Claimant contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s determination of the nature of the party was limited to the ownership aspects of Balkan and its determination of the nature of the transaction focused on \"certain limited provisions of the PPA\".488 According to the Claimant, the place of performance, and the actual performance of the Parties, should also have been considered and accorded greater weight under the \"totality of the circumstances test\". In particular, the Claimant argues that the Supreme Court should have considered the Claimant\u2019s place of business (which was Ghana since incorporation and throughout the first two years under the PPA), as well as the place of performance (which was exclusively in Ghana).489 The Claimant draws attention to what it considers to be an absence of any reference to either the place of business or the Parties\u2019 performance under the PPA in the statement of facts in the Supreme Court Judgment.490 Moreover, the Claimant asserts that there is no discussion by the Supreme Court \"of the conditions precedent provisions of the PPA\", such as the Respondent\u2019s \"continuing obligation to obtain all necessary approvals under their agreement with Balkan\".491\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 31. See also para. 24 prefacing the Claimant\u2019s summary of the judgment: the Ghanaian Supreme Court\u2019s determination of the applicability of Article 181 (5)of the Ghanaian Constitution to the PPA is result-oriented, ignores altogether key facts, relies upon stated criteria which themselves are undefined, and relies upon definition by anecdote or example.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para, 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 36.\n\nClaimant's Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 37; *see also* Statement of Claim, paras. 31.9-320: where Claimant argues that the PPA is \"local in nature\", \"governed by Ghanaian law\" and Respondent never intended that the PPA be an international business transaction.\n\n347.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant makes reference to two more circumstances that the Supreme Court should have considered (and therefore the Tribunal should consider) under the \"totality of the circumstances test\". A first circumstance is the inconsistency of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling with Ghanaian income tax laws.492 According to the Claimant, the purpose of Article 181 of the Ghanaian Constitution is to promote government accountability and prevent the executive branch from transferring the country\u2019s limited financial resources overseas. The Claimant points out that the PPA was concluded between Ghana and a Ghanaian entity, meaning that any income would be taxable in Ghana.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 20-21.\n\n348.\n\nThe second additional circumstance that, according to the Claimant, the Tribunal must take into account is the fact that there have been four other similar power purchase agreements between independent power producers and Ghana, all of which involved a \"major foreign investment\". Ghana chose not to take these four agreements to Parliament. Not one other agreement was the subject of any court proceedings.493\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 22.\n\n349.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Claimant contends that the Supreme Court Judgment should be accorded no weight by the Tribunal on account of its reasoning being \"result-oriented\" and based on undefined factors.494 The Claimant argues that \"the failure of the... Supreme Court to offer clear criteria that do not... beg more questions than they answer and its failure to distinguish between the examples given and the actual facts and circumstances presented by this case.\"495 In particular, the Claimant submits that the Supreme Court failed to identify what criteria determine if a transaction is \"major\", stating only that a certification by the Attorney General \"should be accorded great weight by the courts\" in this determination.496\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 43.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012. para, 43,\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, paras. 38 and 40; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para 19.\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimant also criticizes the Supreme Court Judgment for \"ignor[ing] the fact that Balkan... obtained such a pre-dispute certification from the Attorney General\" and queries why this certification was not given any weight by the Supreme Court.497\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 39. *see also* Statement of Claim, paras. 320-323 and Interim Award, para. 37.\n\n351.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Supreme Court also failed to identify what criteria should be used to ascertain whether a transaction has \"a significant foreign element.\"498 The Claimant notes that the only explanation provided by the Supreme Court Judgment is in response to the Claimant\u2019s example of the purchase of a British Airways ticket, which the Supreme Court observed is not international, but \"in ordinary commerce.\" The Claimant asserts that the judgment does not, however, offer any further definition or other criterion of \"transactions in ordinary commerce\".499 The Claimant further points out that the analysis of that flight ticket is hardly reconcilable with the facts of the present case, arguing that \u201f[i]f, as the Supreme Court suggests, the sale of a fleet of foreign-manufactured automobiles would not be international or major in nature, how is it that a contract which contemplates that a Ghanaian entity lease a barge located in Ghana and commission and operate a power station to provide power to the national grid in Ghana under a license issued by the Government of Ghana, employing hundreds of Ghanaians, is an international business transaction?\"500\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para, 41 referring to Supreme Court Judgment, Exhibit BE[L]-14 at p. 38.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 42.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 43.\n\n352.\n\nIn the Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant also refers to a decision issued by the Supreme Court on 19 July 2013, in which the Supreme Court established that, in general, Article 181(5) does not apply to agreements between foreign investors and governmental agencies. The Claimant contends that the *ratio decidendi* of the Court was an argument advanced by the Claimant in its case before the same Court, namely that \"Parliament would be sucked into unnecessary minutae if it were to have the function of approving every international business or economic transaction.\" The Claimant contends that in the Claimant\u2019s case the Court overcame this difficulty by inventing the additional qualifier \"major\" to be applied artificially to the constitutional concept of \"international transaction\".501\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission para. 24.\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Supreme Court did not assess the Respondent\u2019s compliance with the conditions precedent of the PPA and the establishment of the Effective Date. In particular, the Claimant argues that if Article 181(5) is applicable to the PPA, the Respondent had the obligation to seek parliamentary approval under the terms of the PPA,502 and having not done so, is in breach of the PPA,503 in particular, Clause 7.4.504\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para, 22; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 3, 5:11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 46. For the Tribunal\u2019s convenience, Clause 7.4 of the PPA provides as follows:\n\nIf, on or before the target dates on the Milestone Schedules (Third Schedule), or such later date as the parties hereto may agree, the Effective Date has not occurred and the Parties agree to terminate the Project, GoG shall reimburse and indemnify BE[L] for all costs and liabilities incurred by BE[L] in respect of its obligations under Clause 3 if the GoG is the defaulting party. However, if BE[L] is the defaulting party, no cost incurred shall be recovered from GoG, GoG\u2019s obligations under this Clause 7.4 shall be effective notwithstanding that the Effective Date has not occurred or that all or any of the conditions precedent set out in Clauses 7.2 and 7.3 have not been satisfied or waived. GoG may, upon reasonable notice to BE[L] conduct an audit with respect to any indemnity claimed by BE[L] pursuant to this Clause 7.4 for the purpose of determining if the amount of the BE[L]\u2019s claim for reimbursement has been computed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n354.\n\nIn support of its claim that the Respondent is in default under the PPA, the Claimant contends that \"for the purpose of constitutional scrutiny, the provisions of the conditions precedent and compliance with law section, in particular, the Respondent\u2019s obligation to seek and obtain requisite approvals (including if necessary, parliamentary approval), are not international business transactions\".505 According to the Claimant, the contrary will lead to the *reductio ad absurdum* that the Supreme Court wished to avoid, and would entail that the Respondent could avoid liability for an obligation to seek approval for an agreement involving an international business transaction by merely breaching that obligation.506\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 48.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 49; Claimant also emphasizes that this leads to a situation where \"the Government of Ghana, through its executive, legislative and now judicial branches reserving unto themselves a \u2018king\u2019s x\u2019 with respect to its legitimate obligations under an otherwise binding agreement.\"\n\n355.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant refers to the cross-examination of Ms. Gadzekpo at the hearing, who stated in relation to the PPA that \"ft *was* [initially] *a valid agreement\"* because \"it *was performed by the parties and seen as valid,\"507* since the Attorney General had confirmed that the PPA did not come under the ambit of Article 181(5) of the Constitution.508 The Claimant. denies the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the reason for the Attorney General\u2019s change of mind was the Supreme Court's decision, as the Respondent\u2019s position that the PPA was void *ab initio* was presented to the Tribunal in 2010.509 The Claimant highlights that Ms. Gadzekpo claimed that she was entitled to change her mind about whether the PPA was valid.510\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 23: Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 3, 5-11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 16.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 17.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 18.\n\n356.\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s reading, the Supreme Court Judgment did not declare the PPA to be void,511 and instead merely refers the matter back to the High Court \"to dispose of the case in accordance with this determination as far as relevant to the case before it.\"512 On this basis, the Claimant argues that the High Court could decide that the Respondent had a continuing obligation to seek Parliamentary approval and is therefore liable in accordance with the Claimant\u2019s request for equitable relief.513\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 50.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 50 (emphasis added).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Interim Submission, 20 June 2012, para. 51.\n\n357.\n\nWith regard to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the Claimant finally contends that the wording of Article 181(5) of the Constitution clearly suggests that the determination as to which international transactions should be taken to the Parliament for approval may only be made by Parliament itself, and not by the Supreme Court.514 The Claimant further submits that it was in recognition of this reality that the Parliament drafted a proposal to clarify which transactions are exempted front the requirements of Article 18.S(5).515 This proposal could exempt the Claimant *ex-post facto,* but the Claimant points out that the document is marked as \"secret.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 27.\n\n358.\n\nFinally, the Claimant contends that whatever the situation under Ghanaian domestic law might be, the Claimant may still invoke the PP\u00c0 against Ghana, as the application of Ghanaian law is in this case conditioned by well-established principles of international law.516 The Claimant first submits that the contents of the contract show that the Parties wished to have Ghanaian municipal law applied only as conditioned by public international law,517 The Claimant also maintains that these international principles must be applied (i) because the issue is addressed in the course of an international arbitration proceeding; (2) because the rules of equity and customary international law are among the main legal sources of the Ghanaian legal system according to Article 11(2) of the Constitution; and (3) because (in the Claimant\u2019s view) the Tribunal affirmed in its Interim Award that the principles of international law governing responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts (embodied in the ILC Articles) are applicable to the present case.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 29-31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 30.\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimant points to Article 7 of the ILC Articles, which it considers to embody these principles by precluding a State from taking refuge behind provisions of its internal law. With this in mind, the Claimant adduces the principles of good faith and the sanctity of contracts to affirm that it was entitled to rely on the representation made by the Respondent that the PPA was a valid and binding agreement to which no constitutional impediment applied.518\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 30 *in fine.*\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal must follow the determination in the Supreme Court Judgment and declare the PPA invalid, as well as that the Supreme Court judgment is a final pronouncement on the issue of invalidity of the PPA. Accordingly, Balkan\u2019s contractual claims must be denied and the Tribunal has to decide only Balkan\u2019s alternative non-contractual claims for damages.519\n\nRejoinder, para. 51.\n\n361.\n\nThe Respondent submits that \"the Tribunal is bound to follow the law of Ghana as applied by Ghana\u2019s highest court to the PPA and hold that the PPA is void *ab initio,\"520* and that \"[(there is no conceivable basis\" to hold otherwise.\n\nRejoinder, para. 18; also paras. 19 and 36.\n\n362.\n\nWith respect to the criticism of the Supreme Court Judgment that the Claimant develops in its Interim Submission, the Respondent submits that this \"merely recycle[s] the legal positions that [the Claimant] took, and lost, before the Supreme Court,\"521\n\nRejoinder, para. 38; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 84.\n\n363.\n\nStarting from the premise that the Tribunal is bound to apply the laws of Ghana to the issue of validity of the PPA pursuant to Clause 23 of the PPA and Article 33 of the UNCITRAL Rules,522 the Respondent proceeds to explain why the Tribunal has to follow the Supreme Court Judgment. First, the Parties agree that the Supreme Court of Ghana has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all matters relating to the enforcement or interpretation of the Constitution, pursuant to Article 130(1)(a) of the Constitution.523 Additionally, arbitral tribunals do not have power to enforce or interpret national constitutions, except for considerations of transnational public policy inapplicable in this case. \"524\n\nRejoinder, para, 25 also referring to Claimant\u2019s Submission regarding Procedural order No. 1, paras. 40 and 188; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 85.\n\nRejoinder, para. 27, referring to Ghana\u2019s Brief Regarding Procedural Order No. 1, at 5-10 and Balkan\u2019s Brief Regarding Procedural Order No. 1, para. 162.\n\nRejoinder, para. 28 and note 1\u00ce citing Final Award in ICC case No. 6320 (1992), para. 3.3.\n\n364.\n\nSecond, relying on arbitral decisions and doctrinal sources,525 the Respondent asserts that it is a \"fundamental principle of international law and arbitration that arbitral tribunals should recognize and defer to judgments with force of *res judical.\"*.526 It will also be beyond the scope of the powers of the Tribunal to \"disregard settled authority if there is \u2018sufficient support\u2019 for doing so\", when it has not been empowered by the parties to arbitrate *ex aequo et bono527* Further, failure to follow the constitutional interpretation of the Supreme Court will, according to the Respondent, be ground for refusing recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award under Article V.2(b) of the New York Convention.528\n\n*AMCO* v *Indonesia,* ICSID Resubmitted Case Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/81/1 (1988); Fillip de Ly, Audley Sheppard. *ILA Interim Report on Res Judicata and Arbitration,* Arbitration international, Vol. 25, No. 1 (2009), p. 55; Bernard Hanotiau, *The Res Judicata Effect of an Arbitral Award Rendered in Connected Arbitration Arising form the Same Project,* Ch.

Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s argument regarding the lack of finality of the Supreme Court\u2019s determination concerning the validity of the PPA, the Respondent asserts that \"[a] determination as to the validity of the PPA under the laws of Ghana has... been made by the Supreme Court of Ghana,\"532 The Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s view that remitting the case to the High Court means that the Supreme Court Judgment is \"open to further interpretation\",533 contending that a further determination by the High Court - to the effect that the PPA is not void *ab initio* - would be contrary to the Constitution of Ghana and binding precedent.534\n\nRejoinder, para. 16.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 19, 37, 39, 42,48.\n\nRejoinder, para. 37.\n\n367.\n\nIn further support of its position on finality of the Supreme Court Judgment, the Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant did not apply for review, as it had the right to do within one month from the date of the judgment, pursuant to Rules 54-56 of Ghana\u2019s Supreme Court Rules.535\n\nRejoinder, para. 39.\n\n368.\n\nWith respect to the constitutional constraints on the Ghanaian High Court, the Respondent emphasizes that courts are bound to comply with the decisions of the Supreme Court. In particular, Article 129(3) of the Constitution provides that \"all other courts shall be bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court on questions of law\"536 and Article 130(2) provides that \"[t]he Court in which the question arose shall dispose of the case in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court.\"537\n\nCited in Rejoinder, para. 40.\n\nCited in Rejoinder, para. 41, also referring to Section 2(4) and 3(2) of the Courts Act, 1993.\n\n369.\n\nWith respect to binding precedent, the Respondent submits that in *Faroe,* a decision that the Parties agree is still an authoritative statement of the law,538 the Supreme Court \"held that a contract subject to Article 181(5) is void *ab initio* in all cases absent Parliamentary approval.\"539 The Respondent emphasizes that such an agreement is unenforceable pursuant to Holding 6 of *Faroe:* \"[e]ven though the defendant had, by summary judgment been finally adjudged as having breached the power purchase agreement, the court would refuse to award any damages for the breach because the agreement or contract was unconstitutional for non-compliance with article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution.\"540\n\nRejoinder, para. 42.\n\nRejoinder, para, 42.\n\nRejoinder, para. 45 citing Holding 6 of *Faroe.

According to the Respondent, the argument was rejected at by the Supreme Court, as the definition of \"international transaction\" encompassed the whole PPA, not just certain provisions.545\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 48;l-6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 89.\n\n373.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that public international law is not applicable to the case but only the laws of Ghana. The Respondent sees no legal basis for the application of international law546 - it submits that the Supreme Court has unequivocally affirmed that Ghana is a dualist state in which principles of public international law are not incorporated into the law of Ghana if they are inconsistent with the Constitution or statutes of Ghana as interpreted by its Supreme Court.547\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 91.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 92.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings and Conclusions on the Validity of the PPA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in its Interim Award on Jurisdiction it determined that the arbitration agreement between the Parlies was valid and that accordingly it had jurisdiction to decide on the substance of this dispute under the PPA. At the same time the Tribunal expressed its highest respect for the courts of Ghana and established a long schedule for the written submissions of the Parties and the timing of the hearing on the merits so as to be able to take into full consideration what the Supreme Court of Ghana could have decided on this matter in the light of the proceedings before the courts of that country. The Tribunal must reiterate at this point its respect for Ghanaian judicial processes.\n\n375.\n\nThis Tribunal could not presume to decide an issue of constitutional interpretation in Ghana when the highest courts of the country have considered the matter under their respective jurisdictions. While international arbitration is not subordinated to the views of national courts it nonetheless can consider to the fullest extent possible how to conduct its own jurisdiction in a framework of compatibility and not of confrontation, particularly when national courts are both independent and professionally competent. There are cases in which these fundamental factors are either non-existent or subject, to serious doubt and then the role of international arbitration might be different, but this is certainly not. the case here.\n\n376.\n\nFrom the arguments of the Parties and the judgment of the Supreme Court on this case it is not difficult to realize that there are two aspects to be considered in succession. The first concerns the determination of the nature of the PPA while the second concerns the effects of such determination in the specific circumstances of this dispute. The Supreme Court rightly identified that the essential determination it had to make was whether or not the PPA constitutes an international business transaction under Article 181(5) of the Constitution, with the Court having answered this question in the affirmative. The Supreme Court then proceeded to remit the case to the High Court for its consideration in light of the interpretation made, a proceeding which is still pending before this last court. The Supreme Court did not decide on the effects of its determination which is a task that falls on the High Court.\n\n377.\n\nIn determining that the PPA is an international business or economic transaction for the purpose of Article 181(5) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court also recognized that the matter had not been free from doubt. Three determinations of the Supreme Court reflect this uncertain situation. It first indicated in its judgment that Parliament should consider enacting a Bill indicating what modifications it wishes to make to Article 181(5) of the Constitution so as to provide \"greater certainty and clarity to the law.\" The Court then proceeded to acknowledge the \"need to formulate a clear criterion for distinguishing transactions between the Government and Ghanaian entities that fall under Article 181(5) from others with Ghanaian entities which do not fall in the category of Article 181(5) despite their foreign connections..,\", an acknowledgment which again evidences that the guiding criterion under the Constitution for the purpose of Article 181(5) was not clear enough.\n\n378.\n\nThe third determination by the Supreme Court was to introduce a distinction that had not been expressly made in that Article so as to implicitly understand that only major international business or economic transactions are to be subject to the provisions of the Article in question, in so determining the Supreme Court further noted that Parliament should exercise its legislative power in relation to article 181(5) in order to clarify which transactions are to be viewed as major, again evidencing in this respect that the matter was not settled. In view of this uncertainty the Supreme Court also advised that \"[i]n the interim, a certification from the Attorney-General [before a dispute has arisen] that an international business transaction to which the Government is a party is major or not should be accorded great weight by the courts.\"\n\n379.\n\nOn examining the Supreme Court judgment here considered, this Tribunal notes that the views held by both the Plaintiff and the Defendant before that court are plausible and could not be held to be legally wrong. In fact, as the Court pointed out, the constitutional provision discussed should not. necessarily be read as embracing only agreements between the Government and entities resident abroad, thus reasoning that a party resident in Ghana might be subject to the constitutional requirement if the substance rather than the form of the transaction and other relevant criteria shows a clear international nature of such agreement. At the same time the Court noted that it would be impractical for Parliament to scrutinize every single transaction with international ramifications entered into by the Executive, the bright line separating these different transactions being the distinction between \"major\" transactions and those done in \"ordinary commerce\".\n\n380.\n\nThere can be no doubt about the fact that the PPA embodies the existence of significant foreign components which is what in the end convinced the Supreme Court in reaching the conclusion it did. It is quite true that the PPA viewed as a whole, \"in the round\" as described by the Court, contains several international components, such as the nature of the business and the related investments made or the waiver by the Government of sovereign immunity. The Claimant\u2019s arguments as to the fact that BEL was organized as a Ghanaian company in compliance with the applicable legislation are, however, equally true, and thus the foreign ownership of the company or the foreign nationality of its executives should not necessarily be an obstacle to concluding that the PPA does not qualify as the kind of agreement subject to the requirement of Article 181(5) of the Constitution. The management and control of the company does not lose its connection to Ghana in spite of the foreign interests involved nor is this a consequence of its owners residing abroad. As has been noted above, and as the Claimant rightly notes, this is not a case brought under a foreign investment treaty. Doubts expressed by the Supreme Court about the intended meaning of Article 181(5) are well taken. This Tribunal notes in particular that the Supreme Court rightly considered the provisions of paragraph 5 in the context of Article 181 as a whole, the main concern of which, as stated in its paragraph 1, is that an agreement entered into by the Government for the granting of a loan out of public funds or public accounts must be authorized by Parliament. Paragraph 5 then applies this requirement concerning loans to an international business or economic transaction, calling Parliament to do this \"with the necessary modifications\". These modifications were never introduced. The provision of paragraph 5 as it stands today could be interpreted to the effect that Parliamentary approval is required when an international business or economic transaction is somewhat akin to a loan, which is not the case here, or else that it would have to be specifically modified so as to apply to situations different from a loan, which has not been done.\n\n381.\n\nGhana\u2019s Attorney General requested the Commercial Division of the High Court in Accra in June 2010 to declare that the PPA was an international business transaction that needed Parliamentary approval and not having obtained such approval it was thus unenforceable. This same argument was raised by the Respondent in the arbitration proceedings with which this Award is concerned. The Tribunal must note, however, that these views were expressed over a year after the dispute between the Parties had arisen. Before that the issue had not been raised and the Parties had only discussed the meaning of the PPA but had never questioned its validity. If the materialization of the dispute can be ascertained in mid-2009, as per the facts explained above, this would be the critical date to take into account as to the pertinence of the legal arguments and anything thereafter must be considered as views relating rather to the litigation in progress than to the essence of the Parties\u2019 understandings on the PPA.\n\n382.\n\nThe arguments of the Attorney General before the Ghanaian courts have relied on the broad definition of international arbitration under the ICC Arbitration Rules and other international instruments, as well as on the interpretation of the English Arbitration Act 1996 and statutes on arbitration from Singapore and Ghana, so as to establish that the nature of the PPA is constitutive of an international business or economic transaction. While this Tribunal will discuss the arguments concerning international arbitration further below, the issue is now moot in view of the Supreme Court ruling in its judgment that the provisions of the PPA on this matter do not constitute an international business or economic transaction. The conclusions of this Tribunal in its Interim Award on the validity of the arbitration clause of the PPA have thus been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, although some difference of views apparently persists on the question of the arbitration clause being separate and severable from the contract,\n\n383.\n\nThe identification of a number of internationally related components of the PPA made by the Attorney General and accepted by the Supreme Court do not alter the fact that the company was incorporated in Ghana as required by the Ghanaian legislation and regulations. The case is thus different from a situation in which a foreign company or an agency thereof operates in a certain country without a proper legal registration therein. The Supreme Court has rightly refused in this context to follow the Attorney General\u2019s request to pierce BEL\u2019s corporate veil, an alternative that is open in case of fraud, bad faith or other irregular behavior, but which is not the case here where no irregularities have been alleged in respect of the Claimant\u2019s incorporation in Ghana, as the Claimant has correctly argued before that Court.\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal has also discussed above the difference between this case and one governed by the protection of foreign investments under treaties and other international instruments. In this context it is nonetheless noteworthy that the Attorney General has indicated the relevance of the Ghana-UK Bilateral Investment Treaty as one of the factors listed to support: its argument that BEL\u2019s incorporation in Ghana is insignificant and irrelevant because the sole shareholder of BEL is Balkan UK, While this argument is understandable in the context of arguing that the PPA is an international business or economic transaction requiring Parliamentary approval in spite of BEL being incorporated in Ghana, it nonetheless might lead to the conclusion that the company could be entitled to international legal protection under that Treaty, which contradicts the position of the Respondent that international arbitral tribunals have no jurisdiction in this dispute.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful that the case *Attorney-General* v *Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd,* decided earlier by the Supreme Court, has figured prominently in the discussion of the Parties and the judgment of the Court. In that case the Supreme Court decided that an international business or economic transaction includes business between the Government and a company incorporated abroad, noting however that the fact that Parliament had not made the necessary specifications in pursuance of Article 181(5) did not render that Article inoperable.\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondent asserts in this respect that as there is no constitutional provision proscribing Ghanaian companies from entering into international business or economic transactions with the Government the clause in question should equally apply to such Ghanaian companies. The Claimant argues to the contrary that under relevant international conventions a transaction may be considered international only if it meets strict criteria, such as an agreement between two or more countries, involving parties residing in different countries or involving the crossing of national borders, none of which are present in this case. The Claimant further asserts that none of these elements is defined in the Constitution which cannot be then interpreted as having settled the framework for the application of the provision without the necessary modifications.\n\n387.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of this provision is as noted above plausible but it is only one possible alternative. The views of the Parties are equally well argued, the Court having so recognized in stating that in determining these issues \"we have been greatly assisted by the painstaking Statements of Case filed by the Plaintiff and the Defendants\". It must also be noted that the Court\u2019s interpretation is largely based on the values of probity and accountability that the drafters of Article 181 of the Constitution had emphasized, having found that in this light it is justifiable to read into the provision the implicit requirement of it being applicable also to Ghanaian registered entities and not just to foreign based companies.\n\n388.\n\nAt this point and with due deference and respect, after having considered the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in detail, the Tribunal must depart from the conclusion reached by that Court. The Tribunal is convinced by the Claimant\u2019s views on the need to apply a test taking into account the \"totality of the circumstances\" as the guideline for determining whether a given agreement is subject to the Constitutional provisions discussed. It is not enough to identify the foreign components of the PPA, which as noted do exist, but also the fact that the PPA was entered into by a Ghanaian company registered in Ghana cannot be ignored, Among other features arising from this fact there is the evidence that BEL\u2019s principal place of business is in this country, the production envisaged under the PPA is to supply the domestic electrical market and payments were to be made in Ghana, thus meaning that performance under the PPA was entirely a. domestic business. Questions of taxation in Ghana have also been invoked by the Claimant as evidence that the business was considered a domestic venture. Moreover, even if in international arbitration and international principles of commercial law there is a rather- liberal view to broadly consider what is to be regarded as international, this is not unlimited, as the Claimant noted citing the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980).\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted above that Article 181. of the Constitution is inextricably related to the question of government loans that might entail the transfer of public funds abroad, a purpose not evidently applicable to international business or economic transactions without introducing the necessary modifications to its paragraph 5, as envisaged under this very provision and requested from Parliament on more than one occasion by the Supreme Court. The PPA does not involve the transfer of funds abroad in the sense that a loan does and thus the need for Parliamentary approval is not self-evident either. The fact noted by the Claimant to the effect that four other similar power purchase agreements between private companies and the Government involving some form of foreign investment have not been submitted to Parliamentary approval by the Government, except for one made after the Balkan judgment was issued, suggests that the constitutional requirement is not as mandatory' as it would appear at first sight.\n\n390.\n\nThe discussion about the nature of the PPA, however, is not the end of the matter as the Tribunal has still to determine the proper legal effects of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment. While for the Respondent this judgment means that the PPA is void *ab initio* and not enforceable, and consequently cannot give place to an award of contractual damages, the Tribunal must note that the Supreme Court did not go that far and left in the hands of the High Court the disposition of the specific dispute between the Parties. Although it is theoretically possible that the High Court could reach a determination that the PPA is valid and enforceable, it does not appear to be likely that this will be the case. The Respondent believes that the principle of *res judicata* would necessarily require the High Court to follow the interpretation of the Supreme Court particularly in view that under Article 130(2) of the Constitution lower courts shall dispose of the case in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court. The Respondent also invokes in support of its view the fact that in *Faroe* the Supreme Court held that a contract subject to Article 181(5) is void *ab initio* absent Parliamentary approval.\n\n391.\n\nEven if that were to be the conclusion of the High Court, this Tribunal is convinced that that would not necessarily dispose of the dispute between the Parties. The Claimant has made a convincing argument to the effect that the constitutionality of a contractual agreement between a party and the Government should not be subject to an after-the-event scrutiny when that agreement has been acknowledged and prosecuted by that very Government for years, particularly if any uncertainties are due to the Government\u2019s failure to seek any necessary Parliamentary approval and to clarify the application of the constitutional provisions in question.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls at this point the legal opinions issued on 26 October 2007 by Ghana\u2019s Minister of Justice and Attorney-General. In the first opinion it was noted that *Faroe* \"clearly excludes the project hereof which involves a local company in a local transaction with the Government\" and that in \"light of the above a Parliamentary approval would not be required for the effectiveness of the Agreement\". The second opinion was still more illuminating of the Government\u2019s view on this question as the Attorney General stated that \"all acts, conditions and things required by the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana to be done, fulfilled and performed\" had been indeed satisfied \"in compliance with the laws and constitution of the Republic of Ghana\". It then reached its final determination that Ghana\u2019s obligations under the PPA \"are legal and valid obligations binding on [Ghana] and enforceable in accordance with the terras of the Project Agreements\", further reaffirming that the \"sanctity of contract is recognised under the laws of Ghana and consequently the validity of the Project Agreements and the binding nature of the obligations of the parties there under are constitutionally safeguarded\". In the view of this Tribunal, Ghana cannot be heard subsequently to argue the contrary.\n\n393.\n\nIrrespective of *Faroe* and a later decision of the Supreme Court of 19 July 2013, the latter not being considered by the Tribunal as the Parties have not had the chance to properly discuss it at the hearing, it is evident that the Respondent cannot ignore in the context of this dispute the opinions issued by its highest legal officer at the time of the negotiation of the PPA. The Respondent has argued that the fact that those opinions had to be issued indicated that there were doubts about the legal status of the PPA under the Constitution, but even if this were the case it is perfectly legitimate for a Party to have such doubts and request their clarification by the proper Governmental authorities. Furthermore, in the very terms of the PPA it is the obligation of the Respondent to obtain all necessary approvals for the implementation of the PPA, a provision with which the Respondent has declared itself to be in full compliance. If Parliamentary approval was not sought because rightly or wrongly it was believed unnecessary, the Respondent\u2019s failure to seek Parliamentary approval of the PPA cannot be held today against the Claimant. The question is governed not only by principles of estoppel but by fundamental considerations of good faith,\n\n394.\n\nWhile the Parties disagree on whether international law applies to the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal considers that the issue here is different for under both international law and the domestic law of Ghana, as emphasized by the second opinion of the Attorney General, it: is a well recognized general principle of law that no party can take advantage of its own wrongdoing or omission to the detriment of the rights and interests of another party.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Government had at all relevant times before the commencement of litigation understood and assured the Claimant that the PPA did not require Parliamentary approval and that this view was specifically certified to the Claimant prior to the conclusion of the PPA. The Tribunal also notes that submission of the PPA to Parliament for consideration and approval could only be at the instance of the Respondent and the Claimant had no role or competence in the matter. The Tribunal further notes the request of the Supreme Court that Parliament should clarify which agreements having the nature of international business and commercial transaction are required to be submitted to Parliament for approval, and the Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion that, pending such clarification, a certification by the Attorney Genera], given before litigation has commenced, on whether the nature of a transaction falls or does not fall under Article 181(5) of the Constitution, should be given great weight by the courts. In the view of the Tribunal, this is what the Attorney General did in 2007 before the PPA was concluded,\n\n396.\n\nThe outcome of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, and the Parliamentary clarification suggested by the Court, might well result in the need to submit future agreements similar to the PPA to Parliament for approval but, in the view of the Tribunal, this cannot derogate retroactively from the legitimate rights and expectations of a party, especially where such party is acting on the basis of a considered view of the Government solemnly given at the time when the agreement was being negotiated. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider that it is sustainable to argue that the PPA can be so affected *ab initio.* Such a position would be difficult to explain in legal terms.\n\n397.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations the Tribunal concludes that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Claimant had reasonable expectation that the Respondent had accepted the validity of the Agreement and was, therefore, entitled to rely on the PPA and to expect that the Respondent would fulfill the obligations that it had assumed thereunder. In this connection the Tribunal observes that the principle that a reasonable and legitimate expectations of a party can give rise to a benefit that cannot be denied to that party is a well-acknowledged principle of the common law and is, as such, part of the laws of the Republic of Ghana.\n\n**D. Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nPursuant to Sections 12 and 17 of Ghana\u2019s Evidence Decree, 1976 and the Ghanaian decision, *Majolagbe* v. *Larbi & Ors,548* the Respondent submits that, under Ghanaian law, the party asserting a fact has the burden of producing evidence to prove that fact: the burden of proof requires proof by a \"preponderance of probabilities\".549 The Respondent submits that Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules also provides that each party *has the burden* of proving the fact relied on to support its claim or defense.550 Thus, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has the burden of proving that it fulfilled all the necessary conditions to justify Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA, as well as the burden of proving all of the facts which support its other damages claims.551\n\n*Majolagbe v. Larbi & Ors.* [1959] G.L.R. 190 ***(\"Majolagbe\"),*** at 192, cited at Statement of Defense, paras. 130-134; Sections 10-17 of Ghana\u2019s Evidence Decree, 1975.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 133, citing *Majolagbe,* at 192, in relevant part: \"Proof, in law, is the establishment of fact by proper legal means; in other words, the establishment of an averment by admissible evidence\"; Rejoinder, para, 10.\n\nRejoinder, para. 13.\n\nRejoinder, para. 14.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nThe Claimant objects to the Respondent\u2019s reliance on Ghana\u2019s Supreme Court decision in *Majolaghe* for the burden of proof, emphasising instead that it is the Arbitration Agreement, the UNCITRAL Rules and the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (2010) that inform the applicable burden of proof in these proceedings.552\n\nReply, paras. 149-151.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Burden of Proof**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no difficulty in concluding that Respondent\u2019s arguments the correct in respect of the issue of the burden of proof. Under any relevant rule governing evidence a party that asserts a fact must prove it. The question here is whether, as the Respondent argues, the \"preponderance of probabilities\" is the appropriate test to satisfy the evidentiary requirements or a more stringent standard should apply. Given the uncertainties surrounding some of the facts of this case as examined above, particularly in respect of the technical elements required to set the Power Station in operation, the Tribunal considers that the \"preponderance of probabilities\" test will serve as a guideline to establish whether an argument concerning a fact or a situation is more likely than the other.\n\n401.\n\nIn any event, even if the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence that the Claimant maintains are to be relied on is considered the appropriate guideline, it must be noted that its main evidentiary requirements are satisfied in this case. The Parties have produced abundant documents, witnesses have been called to testify, experts have made their reports and the evidentiary hearing exhausted all possible angles to establish whether a certain fact has or has not been proved so as to convince the Tribunal in reaching its conclusions on the merits. It must also be kept in mind that, as the Parties have invoked contrasting constructions of fact to support their respective arguments about the discharge of obligations under the PPA, it is for each Party to provide convincing evidence of the facts relied on. It is accordingly not just for the Claimant to prove its claim but also for the Respondent to prove its own assertions that it has complied with the obligations under the PPA.\n\n402.\n\nThe Parties have made important evidentiary arguments based on the facts that came to light as a consequence of discovery in the ProEnergy litigation. The Tribunal must note in this respect that it is not its function to rely on the proceedings of a separate dispute between BEL and ProEnergy, one of its principal subcontractors, which was submitted to the United States\u2019 courts. The fact, however, that the Respondent has obtained access to such proceedings and their supporting documents by means of a document production request submitted to and granted by that jurisdiction, and that these documents have been introduced in the record of this arbitration, provides justification for the Tribunal to consider some of the allegations made in that other litigation if they shed light on the facts of the dispute before it.\n\n403.\n\nThe ProEnergy litigation was settled and some information on this agreement has been provided by the Claimant in response to the Tribunal\u2019s request to explain whether ProEnergy has any financial interest in this arbitration.553 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the information provided does not reflect the complete terms of such settlement and from the attachments produced it can be seen that there are financial interests involved, which, the Respondent argues, cast doubt on the testimony of a witness presented by the Claimant.554\n\nClaimant\u2019s 7 June Letter, p. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s 10 July Letter, p. 2.\n\n**E. The Claimant\u2019s breach of contract Claim**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nPursuant to Clause 23 of the PPA, Ghanaian law governs this claim.555 The Claimant submits that the basic applicable tenets of contract Jaw are set out in Ghana\u2019s Supreme Court Opinion *Ghana Ports and Harbors Authority* v. *Issoufou (1993-1994),*556 which in turn relies on the English Court of Appeal decision in *Denmark Productions Ltd. v. Boscobel Productions Ltd.*557558 The Claimant reproduces lengthy excerpts from these decisions in its Statement of Claim.559\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 312.\n\n*Ghana Ports and Harbors Authority v.

Entitlement to Tolling Fees Under Clause 11.9 of the PPA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nFor convenience, the Tribunal restates the particulars of Clauses 11.4 and 11.9 of the PPA, which will be referred to in the Parties\u2019 arguments under this issue, as well as under the issue of grid connectivity, below.\n\n407.\n\nUnder Clause 11.4, BEL is entitled to Tolling Fees for each month following \"the Completion Date\".563 The Completion Date is defined in the PPA as\n\nthe day upon which both parties certify that the Power Station, capable of operating in accordance with the Operating Parameters, has successfully completed its testing and commissioning. However, if BE[L] has completed its tests and [Ghana\u2019s] infrastructure is not ready, the Completion Date shall be deemed to have occurred,564\n\nClause 11.4 of the PPA.\n\nClause 1.0 of the PPA.\n\n408.\n\nClause 11.9 of the PPA provides that Tolling Fees are payable to BEL if it is \"unable to commence testing of the Power Station (on the date nominated by BEL) as a result of [Ghana\u2019s] failure to provide an adequate Transmission Line and interconnection facilities for the Power Station\"; it goes on to state that\n\nthen in any of such events, [Ghana] shall be obligated to commence making payments of Tolling Fees to BE[L] on the thirtieth (30th) day after BE[L] certifies to [Ghana] that the Power Station is complete or would have been complete except for the nonperformance as listed in (i) above. The capacity for the purposes of calculating the Toiling Fees payable under this Clause shall be deemed to be the Nominal Capacity.565\n\nClause 11.9 of the PPA.\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it is entitled to Tolling Fees under the PPA because \"as early as October or November of 2008, but without a doubt by the completion of the [FSNL] milestones [sic] in 2009[,] BE[C]... has demonstrated that it has fulfilled conditions precedents to the Tolling Fees under [Clause] 11.9\".566\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 331.\n\n410.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant denies the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Claimant has not provided any documentary evidence in this arbitration to support its claim to Tolling Fees. The Claimant relies on the principle in the *Majolaghe* decision which states that averments should be supported by evidence where such corroborating evidence should exist. The Claimant further asserts that \"the Respondent has failed to clear the hurdle it sets for itself\".567 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Defense \"offers scant reference to authorities or prior precedent\".568\n\nReply, para. 153.\n\nReply, para. 147.\n\n411.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant reviews the documentary evidence that supports its claims for Tolling Fees, namely the money expended,569 the daily logs and the periodic reports,570 several pictures of the Barge obtained from both Parties571 and the certifications provided by Ansaldo.572 With regard to the latter, the Claimant points to three letters written by Messrs. Pierantonio Savio and Marco Squadrone that certify that the PPA Clause 11.9 milestone was achieved.573\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, para, 37.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 38.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 38, referring to Appendix 11 to the Submission.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 42-48.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 47, referring to Appendices 12, 13 and 14 to the Submission,\n\n412.\n\nFinally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s assertion that it is not liable under Clause 11.9 PPA because BEL lacked the qualification to embark upon the commissioning efforts and because it undertook an unrealistic time schedule to commission the Barge. The Claimant contends that all of its workers and subcontractors had the necessary expertise to fulfill their commitments.574 While the Claimant concedes that the schedule was aggressive, the Claimant maintains that, had the Respondent performed its obligations on time, it would not have been overly ambitious.575\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 49.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras 49-50.\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n413.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant must demonstrate a right to be paid Tolling Fees under Clauses 11.4 or 11,9 of the PPA.576 The Respondent asserts that the evidence presented by the Claimant fails to demonstrate such a right.577 The Respondent further asserts that, \"with one of its two turbines in disrepair, there is no way that Balkan can claim the Power Station was ready for Final Testing and Commissioning, or that Balkan is entitled to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA,\"578 In particular, the Respondent argues that the Parties never jointly certified that the Power Station is capable of operating in accordance with the Operating Parameters, defined in the PPA.579 and that the Claimant fails to present evidence of such joint certification.580\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 121.\n\nStatement, of Defense, para. 121 ;

failures which the Respondent argues are wholly inconsistent with the Claimant\u2019s claim in this arbitration that it is entitled to Tolling Fees from 1 November 2008 forward and that the Barge was ready for Final Testing and Commissioning as of 28 October 2008591\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 130-134;

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s \"excuses\" are without merit and that the Tribunal need not consider the Claimant\u2019s arguments in this regard because, as the ProEnergy Litigation documents show, the Claimant never reached the stage in the commissioning process where it could have connected the Power Station to the Essiama Transmission Line when it was energised (or for that matter the Elubo Transmission Line when it was energised three months later).595\n\nRejoinder, para. 55.\n\n420.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent asserts that the ProEnergy documents demonstrate the Claimant\u2019s \"ongoing failure to commission the 16.1 kV electrical system\", which the Respondent contends \"had to be completed and tested before the Power Station could be connected to the National Grid\";596 and that the Claimant \"failed to reach commissioning milestones for other critical power generation systems for which no grid connectivity is required\".597\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 106.\n\nRejoinder, para. 56.\n\n421.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent contends that the Claimant also failed to demonstrate that it was prevented from commissioning other systems for which no grid connectivity was required.598 In particular, the Respondent draws support from the Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, which opines that \"[i]t is only absolutely necessary to have a connection to the 161 kV Transmission Lines that are part of the National Grid in the seventh and eighth commissioning stages.\"599 The Report explains that \"[t]he [National] Grid connection then provides the electrical load for the generator and \u2018locks in\u2019 the generator to the Grid frequency\";600 \"[t]he Transmission Lins is then used to conduct Performance Testing of the complete Power Station.\"601\n\nRejoinder, para. 68.\n\nExpert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, at 8.\n\nExpert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, at 8..\n\nRejoinder, para. 69; Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para. 4.3(a)(vii).\n\n422.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the Claimant: (i) failed to achieve mechanical testing of the Turbines at FSNL;602 (ii) intentionally misrepresented the condition of the Turbines and the generators to the Respondent at the time the Transmission Lines were energised;603 and (iii) has failed to provide documentary evidence verifying that it successfully commissioned still other systems, such as the DCS, the Turbines\u2019 controls and panels, the two generators and associated phase isolated bus ducts and the Turbines\u2019 rotor blades.604\n\n*See* Rejoinder, paras. 69-73.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, paras, 76-77.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, para. 77.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Claimant\u2019s Entitlement to Tolling Fees**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe examination of the facts concerning the state of the Power Station at the Barge at the time the dispute between the Parties erupted by mid-2009 shows, as discussed above, that the real situation was far from what the Claimant describes as evidence of a \"phenomal [sic] level of achievement on behalf of BE[L]... and its commissioning efforts.\" Phenomenal efforts were indeed done to get the Power Station to a satisfactory operating condition, but these were not on the whole successful. In particular the Tribunal is mindful of the discussion concerning achievement of FSNL, which in spite of those efforts was never attained at a sustainable level lasting beyond seconds or minutes before the system broke down. As will be discussed below, it is true as Claimant asserts that there were repeated problems with the Respondent\u2019s provision of start up electricity and these no doubt caused added difficulties and partial delays, but the Tribunal does not find that these were inextricably related to a delay so major as to prevent the testing and commissioning of the Power Station indefinitely. What the evidence does indicate, however, is that the Claimant appears not to have done an adequate due diligence of the state of the equipment on site when making its technical reports at the time of the negotiation of the PPA and submitting its proposal for a ninety-day completion of the commissioning process.\n\n424.\n\nThe delay of the completion date envisaged under Clause 7.3 of the PPA, which could be triggered by the lack of electricity, has not been shown to have had a causal connection with such problems. The fact that the Power Station has not been tested and commissioned so as to be ready to supply electricity to the National Grid until this very day is due rather to the technical and mechanical failures of the Barge, including the fact noted by the Respondent regarding the state of disrepair of one of the Turbines, which proves that critical milestones could not be achieved irrespective of the lack of adequate supply of site electricity and grid connectivity. The Claimant\u2019s argument that \"not one day has yet run\" on its milestone schedule or toward the completion date because of Respondent\u2019s failure to satisfy its obligations does not find support in the facts set out above.\n\n425.\n\nA convincing argument in this respect is that, as the Respondent points out, the Claimant\u2019s view that it. was entitled to charge Tolling Fees since July 2008 because it had achieved the milestone of \"First Fire\u2019\u2019 at that time is contradicted by Mr. Elders\u2019 deposition of 1 March 2010 in the ProEnergy litigation, in which it was asserted that the subcontractor was in breach of contract as a result of negligence and incompetence with the consequence that the commissioning of the Barge was not even close to completion.\n\n426.\n\nIt is also significant that there is *an.* essential requirement associated to the Completion Date-under Clause 11.4 of the PPA which has not been satisfied. The Clause provides that it is for both parties to certify that the Power Station is capable of operating in accordance with the Operating Parameters and has successfully completed its testing and commissioning. This joint certification was never done.\n\n427.\n\nThe Claimant has also argued that since Ghana failed to provide the adequate Transmission Line and interconnection facilities for the Power Station it was unable to commence testing and it is accordingly entitled to charge Toiling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA. The Claimant asserts that it fulfilled conditions precedent to the Tolling Fees under this Clause in October or November 2008 and certainly on reaching FSNL in 2009. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that monies were spent by the Claimant, great efforts were made, reports produced and pictures shot, as documentary evidence shows, but these are not conclusive as to the state of the Barge or that it has reached the stage of commissioning. The joint certification is still the decisive element missing. The Tribunal, moreover, is not convinced of the accuracy of Ansaldos\u2019s certification. The letters written by Messrs. Savio and Squadrone certifying that the Clause 11.9 milestone had been achieved do not find support in relevant tests and are squarely contradicted by the documentation in the ProEnergy litigation. The continuous quarrelling between the Claimant and its subcontractors also does not help to establish that progress at the Barge was satisfactory, and in any event shows, as the Respondent notes, that the time schedule indicated by the Claimant was unrealistic. Despite the Claimant having notified the relevant authorities of Ghana that testing and commissioning would be ready on 28 October 2008 and supply of power could begin on 1 November 2008, this proved not to be a feasible proposition.\n\n428.\n\nAlthough little in this case appears to be characterized by absolute certainty, in relying on the \"preponderance of the probabilities\" test suggested by the Claimant as governing the burden of proof the Tribunal can only conclude that the conditions precedent for the charging of Tolling Fees were not met. As the Respondent maintains, the Claimant never reached the stage in the commissioning process where it could have connected the Power Station to the transmission lines. Various systems associated to the mechanical testing of the turbines at FSNL, including some not dependent upon connection to the Transmission Lines, could not achieve commissioning either. The Tribunal finds that on the whole the Expert Report of Mr. Parsons Brinckerhoff is credible as reflecting the true state of the situation of the Power Station, including the fact that connection to the Transmission Lines is only necessary at the late stages of commissioning in order to conduct Performance Testing of the complete Power Station,\n\n**2. Entitlement to Incidental Damages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimant further claims incidental damages. These claims turn on the Parties\u2019 disagreement as to whether the Respondent provided the Claimant with adequate site electricity and grid connectivity to enable commissioning, as owed under the PPA.\n\n**(a) Difficulties Related to Site Electricity**\n------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it required a capacity of 2,000 kVa for site electricity.605 As a result of this alleged deficiency in power supply, the Claimant argues that, in March 2008, it was forced to purchase a 1,000 kVa transformer costing USD 30,000.606\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 151.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 154; *see also* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 54.\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Reply does not address the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Claimant is not entitled to incidental damages relating to site electricity, grid connectivity, the RTU / MicroSCADA or the Letter of Credit.607\n\n*See also* Rejoinder, para. 152.\n\nii. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n432.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that it complied with its obligation under Clause 2.5 of the PPA to provide site electricity to the Barge.608 It asserts that from the Effective Date of the PPA, it ran a 33 kV lines from the local electricity distribution network to the Barge.609 The Respondent submits that the Claimant \"confusingly runs several concepts together\" in order to suggest that it did not in fact provide adequate site electricity.610 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s real complaint appears to be that there was only a 200 kVA transformer on site when it took over the Barge.611 In this regard, the Respondent submits that if the Claimant concluded it needed additional transformers on site, under Clause 2 of the PPA, it had the obligation to acquire the equipment at its own cost; which the Respondent emphasizes the Claimant concedes it did in March 2008.612\n\nStatement of Defense, para, 77 *.*\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 77; Witness Statement of Emmanuel Osafo, para. 39.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 76.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 79.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 79.\n\n433.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the damages sought by the Claimant for the alleged breach of the obligation on the Respondent to provide site electricity are costs attributable to the Claimant under the PPA.613 Specifically, the Respondent cites Clauses 3.3(i), 9.2, 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 of the PPA in support of its assertion that the costs of fuel are to be borne by the Claimant, as well as the cost of any equipment that BEL required on site to commission the Power Station (generator and transformers included).614\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 137.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 137.\n\n434.\n\nTo counter the Claimant\u2019s contention that it required a capacity of 2,000 kVA, the Respondent refers to an e-mail dated 14 December 2007 from Mr. Elders to ProEnergy (obtained in the ProEnergy Litigation discovery), wherein he stated that 350 kVA of site electricity was sufficient for ProEnergy to do its job, thereby refusing ProEnergy\u2019s request for additional generators to provide site electricity.615 Similarly, the Respondent refers to Mr. Elder\u2019s deposition in the ProEnergy Litigation, in which he testified that the Claimant provided power \"way beyond what [ProEnergy] asked\".616 The Respondent submits that while the Claimant contends in this arbitration that inadequate or unreliable site electricity prevented it from commissioning the Power Station within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date (thus by 10 March 2008), in the ProEnergy Litigation, Balkan US claimed that ProEnergy could indeed have completed the Power Station by that date.617 The Respondent also highlights the Claimant\u2019s affirmation that the generators it purchased compensated any shortfalls in site electricity from the 33 kV line.618\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 80-81: Exhibit R-25: \"Email from J.D.

The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Provision of Site Electricity\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded above on examining the facts concerning the supply and availability of site electricity that the Claimant\u2019s complaints about Respondent\u2019s discharge of this obligation have merit. What is not quite clear is which power capacity is required for the Barge\u2019s needs. The Claimant argues that it needed a capacity of 2,000 kVa for site electricity and that it had to purchase in 2008 a 1,000 kVa transformer at a cost of USD 30,000. The Respondent maintains that it had made available as from the Effective Date of the PPA a 33 kV line, with stated capacity of 6,000 kVa when transformed,622 from the local electricity distribution network to the Barge, and with this, it had complied with its obligations under Clause 2.5 of the PPA.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 78.\n\n438.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 discussion on this matter is inseparable from their views concerning the question of the transformers and generators on site. As argued by the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s real complaint appears to be that there was only a 200 kVA transformer on site when it took over the Barge. However, the Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that in Mr. Elder\u2019s deposition in the ProEnergy litigation he attested that the Claimant provided power \"way beyond what [ProEnergy] asked.\"\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted in discussing the facts of this matter that while there is no doubt that the Respondent supplied site electricity, the Claimant\u2019s view that this was faulty because of the interruptions that continuously affected that supply is credible. This is what made the purchase of the generators inevitable as the Claimant had to compensate for those shortfalls.\n\n440.\n\nThe Respondent, argues that it is the Claimant\u2019s obligation under Clause 2 of the PPA to acquire the necessary equipment at its own cost, citing also the provisions of Clauses 3.3(i), 9.2, 2.1, 2.2 and 3.1 of the PPA in support of its assertion that the costs of fuel are to be borne by the Claimant, as well as the cost of any equipment that BEL required on site to commission the Power Station, including generators and transformers. However, this does not mean that these provisions can be used as an excuse for the defective supply of site electricity which is a clearly an obligation of the Respondent. Hence to the extent that such additional equipment was necessary to compensate for the defective supply, the Respondent is liable for its cost and any incidental damages.\n\n441.\n\nThis conclusion must be related to the conclusion that the Tribunal reached above on the fact that the Claimant could not finalize the testing and commissioning of the Power Station at any relevant time. Although the Claimant asserts that this was due, among other factors, to the lack of supply of adequate site electricity, the Tribunal has not found a causal relationship between such defects in the electricity supply and the Claimant\u2019s inability to comply with its main obligation under the PPA, which was due to different reasons. It cannot be doubted that the shortages in site electricity caused delays in the commissioning process, but these were not impediments to the necessary progress that ought to have been made in the ninety-days following the Effective Date, particularly if BEL believed, as claimed in the ProEnergy litigation, that the subcontractor could have completed the Power Station by that date.\n\n442.\n\nIn any event, as the Respondent notes, the Claimant maintained in the ProEnergy litigation that the generators it purchased compensated for any shortfalls in site electricity from the 33 kV line. As noted above, in an e-mail dated 14 December 2007 to ProEnergy, Mr. Elders stated that 350 kVA of site electricity was sufficient for ProEnergy to do its job, and consequently refused ProEnergy\u2019s request for an additional generator to provide site electricity. While it can be assumed that occasional shortages could be corrected with generators coming into operation their use would not be on the whole an adequate substitute for a fully reliable supply of site electricity. But even then it is difficult to argue as Claimant does that testing and commissioning were indefinitely delayed because of this reason, for even if electricity problems could have caused some degree o\u00ed' disruption this could have been corrected by the day-to-day extension of the Completion Date as envisaged in Clause 7.3 of the PPA. It is also to be noted that in the Respondent\u2019s argument the Barge, as equipped by its manufacturer Ansaldo, came with a 2,800 kVA Black Start Generator, capable of a 250 kW emergency load in the event electricity from the grid was not available.\n\n**(b) Difficulties Related to Grid Connectivity**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n443.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent failed to provide grid connectivity and, that this failure made it impossible for it to perform a final test on the critical systems and commission the Power Station623 The Claimant stales that the Respondent agreed to provide BEL with a transmission line knowing that it would not be ready by the agreed date (31 December 2007).624 It further contends that although the Elubo transmission line, which the Respondent claims could provide grid connectivity starting on 8 August 2008, was energised it was nonetheless not ready, and an attempt to energise it resulted in a general fault of the line.625 Finally, the Essiama transmission line required modifications, recalibration and coordination of the relay protection with the Elubo line to provide grid connectivity to the Barge.626 On the whole the Claimant alleges that this lack of grid connectivity entitles it to Tolling Fees from the Respondent, pursuant to Clause 11.9 of the PPA.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 284,\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para, 73.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 75; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 5, 10:25 to.12:11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 76.\n\nii. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n444.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s allegations regarding grid connectivity are contradicted by the written record.627 The Respondent asserts that adequate grid connectivity has been available since August 2008, hence, the Claimant\u2019s purported entitlement to Tolling Fees under Clause 13.9 of the PPA \"is without merit since that clause only permits Balkan to charge Tolling Fees if the systems and the Barge are already complete but the Government has failed \u2018to provide an adequate Transmission Line\"\u2019.628\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 87.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 98.\n\n445.\n\nAs detailed in the Statement of Facts above, the Respondent points to its letter to the Claimant dated 28 July 2008, wherein it advised that the 161 kV Transmission Line was in place to connect the Power Station to the National Grid, pursuant to Clause 2.8 of the PPA,629 the Fourth Schedule630 and, most importantly, the Grid Connection Process Agreement631632 The Respondent further refers to the subsequent exchanges between the Parties dated 29 August and 12 August 2008, in which the Claimant expressed its alleged concerns for why the Transmission Line could not yet be energised and, in turn, the Respondent replied that there was no obstacle to energizing the Line.633 According to the Respondent, the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines were in good condition and were energised \"well before Balkan (a) completed the 161 kV electrical system on the Power Station, (b) rectified what it claimed were the substantial inadequacies it found when ProEnergy left the Project Site at the end of October 2008, or (c) first achieved what it claims was a firing of the turbines up to FSNL in March and July 2009\"634\n\nClause 2.8 of the PPA provides that the Respondent \"shall construct, install and connect the Transmission Line as required under the Fourth Schedule provided, however, that BE[L] will be responsible, at its own cost, for the provision of adequate transmission cable to the point of interconnection to the National Grid.\"\n\nThe Fourth Schedule of the PPA provides that the 161 kV Transmission Line \"be capable of taking the maximum output of the Power Station.\"\n\nExhibit R-52: \"Osagyefo Power Barge Grid Connection Process Agreement\", signed 17 June 2008.\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 88-91; Exhibit R-53: \"Letter from Isaac Nyantakyi to Phillip Elders, Re: Osagyefo Power Barge Grid Connection Process\"; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 101: \"VRA letter re: line connectivity\".\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 92-95; Exhibit R-26: \"Letter from Phillip Elders to the Minister for Energy, Re: Grid Connection Process.

Phillips, *ProEnergy Services, LLC* v. *Balkan Energy Co,,* No. 09-4026\", at 44:23-45:2.\n\niii. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings in Respect of Grid Connectivity\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 discussions on the question of grid connectivity mirror to a meaningful extent their discussions on site electricity. For the Claimant the lack of adequate grid connectivity is one further cause that prevented it from achieving the final testing and commissioning of the Power Station, while the Respondent maintains that it duly discharged its obligations under the PPA by enabling the Transmission Lines properly energised with enough anticipation.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that the Essiama and the Elubo Transmission Lines were energised by the times indicated by the Respondent, beginning in August 2008. The Respondent\u2019s letter to the Claimant dated 28 July 2008 shows that the 161 kV Transmission Line required to connect the Power Station to the National Grid was in place. Maintenance and reparation works on the lines was also done following the concerns expressed by the Claimant on the readiness of such lines. As the Respondent notes, all these tasks were completed well before BEL had installed the 161 kV electrical system on the Power Station and rectified the problems found when ProEnergy left the Project Site at the end of October 2008, just as it was in anticipation of what the Claimant describes was the firing of a turbine at FSNL.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the Respondent\u2019s assertion that by 8 August 2008 the line required for the 365 MV A transmission, the maximum output of the Power Station, was energised and in service ready for connection to the Binge is credible, as also is the explanation that it energised the Elubo Transmission Line to Tower 3 on 13 November 2008. Additional difficulties arose between the Parties concerning the work to energise either Transmission Line from Tower 3 to the Barge, which has also been a matter of reciprocal complaints.\n\n451.\n\nThat the lines were energised does not mean, however, that they were exempt from problems. The Claimant\u2019s arguments to the effect that at points there were general faults of the line, with particular reference to the Elubo Transmission Line, or that various modifications, recalibrations and coordination of the relay protection of the Essiama line with the Elubo line were necessary is equally credible. As noted, most of the reparation and maintenance work of the lines, including the problems of jungle overgrowth, were prompted by the Claimant\u2019s expressions of concern in that respect.\n\n452.\n\nBut, as was also concluded in respect of site electricity, the difficulties caused by these problems do not have a causal relationship with the fact that the Power Station was not. ready for final testing and commissioning at any relevant point in time. As it was concluded above, this situation finds its roots in other factors that, cannot, be attributed to the Respondent. From the ProEnergy Litigation documents made available by the Respondent it appears that the Claimant was aware that the Government might have considered calling a default on account of the failure of BEL and ProEnergy to complete the refurbishment of the Power Station on schedule, a consideration that would have been hardly possible if the reason for such failure was attributable to the Respondent\u2019s failure to provide adequate Transmission Lines in working condition. To the extent, however, that the difficulties caused by the Transmission Lines resulted in expenditures and delays for the Claimant they could well lead to incidental damages due to the Claimant, a matter to be considered further below.\n\n**(c) The RTU**\n---------------\n\n453.\n\nMuch of the Parties\u2019 argument relating to \"grid connectivity\", in turn, centers on the condition and availability of the RTU / MicroSCADA, and in particular the question of which party had the responsibility to commission this system and whether the RTU/MicroSCADA was a prerequisite to establishing grid connectivity.\n\ni. Boundary Definitions\n-----------------------\n\n454.\n\nThe respective responsibilities of the Parties are laid out in the definitions section of the PPA, which provide, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Dead End Tower\" shall mean the last tower on the Site or such other points as may he agreed upon by the Parties.\n\n\"Delivery Point\" shall be the dead end tower where responsibilities for the equipment by [Ghana] and the BE[L] are demarcated.\n\n\"Transmission Line\" means the 161 kV voltage transmission line(s), transmission towers, substations and other items necessary to transmit electricity from the outgoing gantry of the switching facility within the Site to the National Grid as further described and having the specifications set out in the Fourth Schedule.\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n455.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the definition of the \"Dead Tower\" under the PPA and, in particular, that it may be defined by \"such other points as may be agreed upon by the Parties.\"639 According to the Claimant, the Parties agreed upon such other point as including the RTU because it is implicitly part of the Transmission Line.640\n\nReply, para. 11.\n\nReply, paras. 11, 14.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n456.\n\nThe Respondent contends that since the RTU is located on the Barge, and the Respondent\u2019s responsibility for providing equipment ends at the Dead End Tower outside of the Barge,641 that responsibility for the RTU necessarily falls to the Claimant. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant\u2019s argument that the RTU is part of the Transmission Line is \"incorrect\" because the \"function of the RTU is to control and monitor equipment on the Power Station\".642\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 101 ; Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\nRejoinder, para. 84: Rejoinder Witness Statement of Eric Asare, paras, 4-5; Expert Report of Parsons Brinckerhoff, para. 5.30.\n\n457.\n\nIn the alternative, even if the Tribunal were to find that the RTU was part of the Transmission Line, because the RTU is located in the Substation\u2019s control room on the Barge, the RTU would nevertheless be outside the area where the definition says the Transmission Line terminates (**\"from the outgoing gantry\"**).643\n\nRejoinder, para. 84; Rejoinder Witness Statement of Eric Asare, para. 11.\n\n458.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that \"the entirety of the substation located on the [B]arge were [sic] the responsibility and obligation of the Government\",644 the Respondent points out that the Claimant acknowledged its responsibility to commission all of the other systems on the Substation, including the 161 kV GIS switchgear, the transformers, the relay protection devices and the GIS control cabinets.645\n\nReply, para. 15.\n\nRejoinder, para. 85; *See e.g.,* R-33: \"Letter from Scott Kinney to J.D. Robinson, Re; Barge Power 161 kV remote control and data acquisition system (SCADA)\", R-83; \"Email from Scott Kinney to J.D, Robinson and other, Re; 161 kV GIS Switchgear Status\", R-84: \"Email from Scott Kinney to Vincent Jones, Re;\", R-98; \u201fEmail from J.

Robinson, Re:\", R-102: \"Email from Scott Kinney to J.D. Robinson, Re:\".\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Boundary Point Separating the Parties\u2019 Responsibilities*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe PPA\u2019s definition of the \"Dead Tower\" is in the Tribunal\u2019s reading clear enough, \"Dead End Tower\" is defined as the last tower on the Site or such other points as may be. agreed upon by the Parties. The location of this last tower is not disputed so the question is whether there was a. different point agreed to between the parties where responsibilities of the Parties\u2019 would be demarcated in terms of the provision of equipment necessary for the connection to the Transmission Lines. Although the Claimant maintains that such was the case because the RTU was implicitly a part of the Transmission Line, the Tribunal\u2019s reading is different. As the Respondent notes, this equipment is on the Barge and Respondent\u2019s responsibilities end at the Dead End Tower outside the Barge. It. follows that responsibility for the RTU system will belong to the Claimant as there is no basis for extending the Respondent\u2019s responsibility further into the Barge. The Claimant\u2019s assertion that the entirety of the Substation is the responsibility of the Respondent is misplaced, particularly considering that, as the Respondent has also noted, every other system on the Barge has been understood by the Claimant as falling under its own responsibility.\n\n460.\n\nMoreover, as the Respondent has also argued and the Tribunal has discussed above on examination of this question on the facts, the main function of the RTU/Micro SCADA system is to control and monitor equipment on the Power Station, a function which quite naturally will be related to the information the system will be receiving from the operations of the Transmission Lines but which is separate from such lines. This interpretation is further confirmed by the fact that \"Transmission Line\" is defined as the 161 kV voltage transmission line(s), transmission towers, substations and other items necessary to transmit electricity from the \"outgoing gantry of the switching facility within the Site\" to the National Grid, a definition which does not cover equipment located further to the inside of that outgoing point.\n\nii. Was Commissioning of the RTU / MicroSCADA a Pre-Requisite to Grid Connectivity?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n461.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the Barge could not be connected to the National Grid until after installation and commissioning of the RTU on the Barge.646 The Claimant advances the view that \"a fully operating properly commissioned RTU\" was a pre-requisite to grid connectivity.647 The Claimant asserts that it repeatedly drew the Respondent\u2019s attention to its responsibilities regarding the control and relay protection systems on the Barge.648 The Claimant submits that the installation of the RTU is a \"clear example of... dovetailing\", whereby the Respondent was required to complete its physical work on the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines in order for the Claimant to be able to reach FSNL.649\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 115.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 216; Exhibit C-39: Witness Statement of Robert MacDonald; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, paras. 70, 198\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 193; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, para. 70.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 193.\n\n462.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Substation \"could not be integrated into\" the grid system without the RTU.650\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 334.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n463.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that the RTU is not a pre-requisite to grid connectivity, asserting that \"numerous substations are connected to the grid and integrated into its communication system without an RTU.\"651 The Respondent also contends that \"[the Claimant\u2019s] arguments regarding the RTU in these proceedings are... premature and irrelevant.\"652 The function of the RTU is, amongst others, to monitor and control the GIS, which in turn is the a pre-requisite to grid connectivity. As the GIS was not operational when the lines were allegedly energised on 8 August 2008, the Respondent submits that the Claimant could not have connected to the Grid regardless of the status of the RTU.653\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 138; Witness Statement of Eric Asare, para. 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 138.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, para. 138.\n\n*The Tribunal's Findings on the RTU as a Prerequisite to Grid Connectivity*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe discussion on this matter follows closely that examined above, on the facts and the legal arguments do not change the conclusions there reached. That the RTU system is necessary for the proper functioning of the interconnection to the National Grid is true but. this assumes that the testing and commissioning of the Power Station has been finalized. Once this last stage has been satisfied the RTU will make the interconnection possible. Before that there will be no power generation to be integrated into the National Grid. As the Respondent has noted, if the GIS electrical system was not operational there could have been no connection possible irrespectively of the RTU. It. follows that while the RTU is necessary for grid connectivity, it is in turn dependant on the 161 kV electrical system of the Barge. If the latter is unavailable there is no role for the RTU to perform or power to be transmitted.\n\niii. Which Party had the Obligation to have the RTU / MicroSCADA installed and Commissioned?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the installation and commissioning of the RTU fell within the ambit of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the PPA and the Grid Connection Process Agreement.654\n\nStatement of Claim, para, 193; Exhibit C-38: Witness Statement of Phillip Elders, paras. 70.\n\n466.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that Ghana adopted a National Electricity Grid Code to create a Commission to promulgate uniform rules concerning the National Grid and that, pursuant to the Code, GREDCo was required to install and commission the RTU on the Barge.655 At the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant placed particular emphasis on this argument, asserting that Ghana\u2019s Grid Code and other relevant legislation - particularly LI 1934, enacted by the board of the Energy Commission on 4 June 2008,656 and entered into force on 23 October 2008657 (the same day the October 2008 version of the Grid Code was circulated)658 - inform the interpretation of the PPA because it shows that high-voltage substations form part of the NITS, and therefore fall within the grid operator\u2019s responsibility.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 45, 115.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 17:7-8.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1,22; 11.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 22:14- 16.\n\n467.\n\nIn its opening Statement at the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant first submits that\n\nLI 1934 clearly defined what was to be considered the NITS in Ghana. This is found in Rule 3, which simply states that the NITS is any equipment regardless of ownership, which is designed to function or operate at any voltage higher than 36 kV. Thus [...] any reference to equipment that operates at a high voltage, for example 161 kV, is considered by this provision of Ghana law to constitute part of Ghana\u2019s NITS.659\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1-11:23-12:6.\n\n468.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the specific obligations of the\n\nutility as it relates to matters in these proceedings. Rule 5(3)(h) of LI.1934 required the utility - which is GridCo, which was established in 2006 - to plan, develop, install and maintain an adequate supervisory control and data acquisition system, which was specifically defined to include both telecommunications and remote terminal units at transmission substations and generating stations.660\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 12:7-15,\n\n469.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that Rule 7(c) of 11 1934 provides that GridCo was to be \"responsible for coordinating the design, installation and maintenance of protection systems to ensure the timely disconnect of faulty facilities and equipment\"661\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 12:16-19.\n\n470.\n\nFourth, \"and very relevant to these proceedings\" the Claimant submits \"Rule 8 [of LI 1934] provides that for a person to become a wholesale supplier, that person was required to design, install and maintain its plan and equipment to meet the requirements of a document called the Connection Sub-Code, and other relevant regulations.\"662\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day I, 12:20-25.\n\n471.\n\nFifth, the Respondent points to Rule 11 of LI 1934, which mandates the Energy Commission to issue and prepare a Grid Code to govern the technical operation of the NITS.663 According to the Claimant, \"if it is true that no Grid Code had been formally put into place as of the date of enactment of LI 1934, there are provisions in that LI that placed an obligation on existing grid participants - such as the Claimant and the Respondent - to comply with these rules immediately upon their coming into force.\"664\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 13:5-8.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 13:21-14:2.\n\n472.\n\nThe crux of the Claimant\u2019s argument appears to he that \"[n]o time is given for any transition from one system or form of existence to the other. Rather, persons in the position of the Claimant were in the interim subjected to what the LI called \u2018existing rules and Prudent Utility Practice\u2019\".665 Rule 33 of LI 1934 defines Prudent Utility Practice to mean \"generally accepted design practices, methods and operation of a power system... to meet utility and industry codes, standards and regulations\".666 It follows, according to the Claimant, that \"LI 1934\u2019s reference to \u2018existing rules asid Prudent Utility Practice\u2019 is a reference to the April 2007 draft, the July 2007 version, the [23] October 2008 version,667 and all other versions that came into existence within that period.\"668 The Claimant emphasizes that it is no coincidence that the Grid Connection Process Agreement about the RTU was concluded between the Parties on 24 October 2008. just, one day after LI 1934 came into force.669\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 14:2-6.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 14:11 -16.\n\nExhibit C-46.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 16:3 3-17.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 22:9-23.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n---------------------------\n\n473.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the installation and commissioning of the RTU was the obligation of the Claimant under Clauses 2 and 3 of the PPA, citing the following excerpts in support:670\n\n\u25aa BEL is responsible for \"equipping, completion, testing, commissioning and financing of the Power Station.\"671\n\n\u25aa \"all costs... in connection with the equipping of the Power Station... shall be borne by BEL.\"672\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 138.\n\nClause 3.1 of the PPA.\n\nClause 2.2 of the PPA.\n\n474.\n\nThe Respondent also draws attention to the term \"Delivery Point\", defined in Clause 1 of the PPA as the \"dead end tower where responsibilities for equipment by [Ghana] and BE[L] are demarcated\", and the term \"Dead End Tower\", defined as the last tower on the site (Tower 1).673 In this regard, the Respondent submits that \"all equipment heading away from Tower [1] and the Project Site towards Tema are the responsibility of the Government. All the equipment heading away from Tower [1] and throughout the Project Site are the responsibility of Balkan.\" R follows, argues the Respondent, that \"jsjince the RTU is inside the Project Site, it is the responsibility of Balkan just like every piece of equipment on the Barge, such as the turbines, the DCS, the MicroSCADA, the switchgear, the relay protection devices, etc.\"674\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 101, citing Clause 1 of the PPA (without emphasis added by Respondent); Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 144.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 101.\n\n475.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, as of December 2007, the Claimant acknowledged that commissioning the RTU / MicroSCADA was its obligation, as is evidenced by the fact it sought and obtained proposals from ABB and Taurus for this work,675 In particular, the Respondent points to an e-mail dated 2 February 2009 from Mr, Robert MacDonald, on behalf of BEL, to Mr, Christian Moeller from ABB, after the Claimant had received ABB's proposal for installing and commissioning the RTU / MicroSCADA.676 The Respondent also points to the declarations made by Mr. Elders at the hearing, in which he makes reference to this same proposal.677 The Respondent asserts that \"[a]s Balkan\u2019s response to ABB makes clear, Balkan understood that the commissioning and upgrade of the control system, including the RTU on the Barge, was its responsibility, not the Government's, and in fact, directed ABB to redraft the proposal to meet Balkan\u2019s requirements and specifications.\"678\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 138, 102; *see also* 103-107.,109-111.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 110; Exhibit R-36: \"Email from Robert MacDonald to Christian Moeller, Re: Technical Review of Osagyefo Barge RTU/SCADA\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 148, referring to Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 2, 127:7-13.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 110; Exhibit R-36; \"Email from Robert MacDonald to Christian Moeller, Re: Technical Review of Osagyefo Barge RTU/SCADA\".\n\n476.\n\nThe Respondent advances the view that none of the Claimant\u2019s assertions with respect to the RTU / MicroSCADA \"can obscure the simple fact that the RTU was equipment on the Barge that Balkan had the responsibility to install and commission. Its failure or delay in doing so represents a further default on its part under the PPA, and not a basis upon which it can claim an entitlement to Tolling Fees under the PPA\".679\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 112.\n\n477.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s arguments related to the Grid Code should be disregarded, asserting that the Code was not promulgated until October 2009, and thus has no bearing on the Parties\u2019 respective responsibilities under the PPA and, specifically, on the issue of responsibility for the RTU.680 The Respondent emphasizes that the Grid Connection Process Agreement entered into by the Parties on 24 August 2008 confirms that BEL would commissioned and pay for the RTU.681 The Respondent relies on the testimony of Mr. Wiafe,682 who said that fo he expressly rejected Mr. Elders\u2019 assertion that refurbishment of the RTU on the Barge was the Respondent\u2019s responsibility under the Grid Code.683\n\nCross-examination of Vivienne Gadzekpo, Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 7,108:17-25.\n\nRejoinder, para. 98.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 5, 79:15-25; 91:11-17.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 149.\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Obligations to Install and Commission the RTU/MicroSCADA System*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nAgain on this matter the Parties\u2019 legal arguments relate closely to the facts on the very same question that has already been examined above, that is, who was responsible for installing and commissioning the RTU/MicroSCADA system on the Barge. The Tribunal concluded then that it was the Claimant\u2019s responsibility to pay for the commissioning of the system. The Claimant\u2019s legal argument, however, submits that the installation and commissioning of the RTU fell within the ambit of the Respondent\u2019s obligations, In the Claimant\u2019s view this was so because under the various preliminary versions of the Grid Code preceding its final enactment in October 2009, as well as under law LI 1934, enacted by the board of the Energy Commission and in force since October 2008, GRIDCo was the entity responsible for installing and commissioning this equipment on the Barge as a part of substations operating at a voltage higher than 36 kV, which is the case. here. Other provisions of LI 1934 envisaged Gridco\u2019s mandate as including the responsibility to install, maintain and supervise and control data acquisition systems.\n\n479.\n\nAlthough the Claimant accepts the fact that the Grid Code was not in force at the time the PPA was executed, it. argues nevertheless that under LI 1934 there were obligations to comply with its rules immediately' upon entering into force and no time was given for a transition between one system and the other. Existing rules and Prudent Utility Practice, also defined in that Law, led directly to the application of the draft versions of the Grid Code beginning in April 2007 until its final version and entry into force. The very Grid Connection Process Agreement about the RTU was as noted concluded between the Parties on 24 October 2008, just one day after LI 1934 came into force.\n\n480.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s arguments are well put and would be quite convincing were it not for the fact that they encounter two equally powerful legal arguments on the side of the Respondent. The first is that responsibility for the equipping of the Power Station and ail its costs are clearly to be borne by the Claimant under Clauses 2 and 3 of the PPA. These clauses do not refer specifically to the RTU but do envisage all the equipment required for the operation of the Power Station. The second argument is that the Dead End Tower that demarcates the Parties\u2019 responsibilities is defined as the last tower on the site and while everything heading outwards from that Tower is Respondent\u2019s obligation everything heading inwards to the Power Station is the responsibility of the Claimant. It is of course well established that the RTU is located inside the Project Site. The Tribunal must note, however, that although the respective areas of responsibility are not always well demarcated and may depend on specific arrangements this does not detract from its conclusion concerning responsibility for the RTU.\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal also discussed on the facts that the Claimant at first acknowledged its obligations in respect of this system, as is well reflected in the correspondence between BEL and prospective subcontractors, particularly ABB and Taurus. There was no doubt in this correspondence as to which was the entity responsible for the installation and commissioning of the RTU. As noted above, a similar understanding was reflected in the Grid Connection Process Agreement of 24 August 2008 and also confirmed by Mr. Wiafe\u2019s testimony.684\n\nWitness Statement of Joseph Wiafe, para. 13; Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Dav 5, 79:17-25 and 82:5-85:22.\n\n482.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that its task is to decide the dispute between the Parties principally as a matter of contractual interpretation under the PPA. The terms of the PPA must accordingly govern its reasoning and conclusions. In this light, the PPA itself and also the supplementary agreement between the parties on the Grid Connection Process, clearly show that the installation and commissioning of the RTU and its costs are to be borne by the Claimant. The understanding of the Parties as expressed in the various exchanges noted also confirms this interpretation. The Grid Code came later and it expressly envisaged that it shall not derogate from contractual agreements. However many earlier drafts of the Grid Code there might have been none of these earlier drafts can derogate from the terms of the contractual obligation as the Grid Code itself provides that it does not. Accompanying legislation, which in itself is not clear enough, is not dispositive of this matter. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent prevails in this matter.\n\n**(d) Other Contractual Breaches: the Letter of Credit**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimant\u2019s Position\n--------------------------\n\n483.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges the Respondent failed to comply with its obligations regarding the Letter of Credit and that it did not obtain the necessary approvals, permits and licenses called for under the PPA.685 The Claimant does not elaborate further on its allegations in this regard.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 335.\n\nii. The Respondent\u2019s Position\n-----------------------------\n\n484.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s additional claims under the \"Other Breaches\" heading are \"so general and non-specific as not to warrant a response-\".686 With respect to the Letter of Credit, it understands the Claimant\u2019s \"complaint to be that the Government refused to certify, under the terms o\u00ed\u2019 the [Letter of Credit], that Balkan is entitled to Tolling Fees\".687 The Respondent\u2019s position is that, since it does not owe the Claimant Tolling Fees, it is not in breach of the Letter of Credit or the PPA \"by reason of its refusal to provide a false certification to the Bank\".688 Alternatively, should the Tribunal consider that the Claimant is entitled to Toiling Fees, the Respondent refers to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the replacement letters of credit were not always issued 30 days prior to the expiry of the one previously issued. The Respondent submits that such claim must fail because (a) the PPA -Clause 34.1.4.2.- provides a 60 day grace period in case of default; (b) any claim for breach was waived by the Claimant when it accepted the replacement Letters of Credit without objection; (c) the Claimant suffered no damage since it never sought to draw upon a letter of credit when one was not in place.689\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 339.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 139; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 154.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 139; *see also* R-41: \"Establishment of Letter of Credit - Power Purchase From Generation on the Osagyefo Power Barge\"; R-80: \"Letter from Dr. M. Apiagyei Gyamfi to Balkan Energy Company LLC, Re: Power Purchase Agreement between Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy Ghana Ltd - Letters of Credit\", R-81 : \"Letter from Phillip.Elders to Dr. M. Apiagyei Gyamfi, Re: Power Purchase Agreement Between Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy Gh. Ltd. - Letter of Credit\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para 197.\n\niii. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings Concerning the Obligations Pertinent to the Letter of Credit\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nBoth the factual findings made above on this other matter and the legal arguments developed by the Parties lead to the same conclusion. The Claimant argues that the Respondent did not comply with its obligations in respect of the Letter of Credit without much further elaboration, except to point out that the Respondent refused to certify in the terms of the Letter of Credit that Claimant was entitled to Tolling Fees.\n\n486.\n\nSince the Tribunal has concluded that no Tolling Fees were owed to the Claimant in view of the fact that the Power Station never came to the stage of completing its full and final testing and commissioning, the basis for the issuance of the Letter of Credit was no longer available and Respondent\u2019s argument to the effect that it could not certify an untrue fact is persuasive. The Parties\u2019 discussion about whether other requirements concerning the replacement of the letters of credit within certain deadlines were met is therefore moot.\n\n487.\n\nAlthough the Claimant has also raised the question that it incurred in financial costs in connection with its operations and bank accounts with Zenith Bank, with particular reference to the Letter of Credit, such costs, even if incurred, are not attributable to the Respondent.\n\n**F. The Claimant\u2019s Claim of breach of the Arbitration Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Claimant contends that since the Tribunal issued its Interim Award concluding that the Arbitration Agreement was valid and enforceable, the Respondent has nevertheless continued to take actions in breach of the Parties\u2019 Arbitration Agreement.690 First, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s commencement of the proceeding before a US District Court to obtain discovery from ProEnergy was improper.691 Second, the Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s continued pursuit of its referral of the constitutionality of the PPA to the Supreme Court of Ghana, constitutes a breach of the Arbitration Agreement.692\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 349; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 93.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 350; Statement of Defense, para. 141.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 351 ; Statement of Defense, para. 141.\n\n489.\n\nThe Respondent counters that the Claimant\u2019s claim for breach of the Arbitration Agreement on the basis of the United States and Ghanaian litigations is \"without merit\"693 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent maintains this position in light of the Supreme Court Judgment of 16 May 2012.694\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 140.\n\nRejoinder, para. 155.\n\n**2. The Proceeding Against ProEnergy for Discovery**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s *ex parte* application before a US District Court for, what the Claimant characterizes as \"broad discovery\" from ProEnergy, violates the Parties\u2019 Arbitration Agreement.695 The Claimant submits that due to the Respondent\u2019s actions in this regard, it was forced to file submissions in an attempt to intervene in the United States proceeding,\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 350; Exhibit C-48: \"Application for Government of Ghana Discovery\".\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the proceeding it initiated in the United States was pursuant to United States Statute 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782,696 and was brought against ProEnergy, not BEL or Balkan. The Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant \"voluntarily chose to intervene in that proceeding rather than rely on ProEnergy\u2019s objection\" and, as such, \"had a full and fair opportunity to express its view to the US District Court regarding the discovery application, including its view that \u00a7 1782 should not apply where an arbitration is pending\".697 The Respondent further contends that the Claimant \"cites no authority, UNCITRAL Rules, or Arbitration Tribunal which has ever held that it is a breach of an Arbitration Agreement for a party to seek discovery of a third party, such as ProEnergy, which is not a party to an arbitration and not subject to the jurisdiction or discovery orders of the Arbitration Tribunal\".698\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 143, Respondent states that \"section 1782(a) enables foreign litigants io petition United States courts in order to assist them in obtaining discovery of evidence in the United States. Section 1782(a) provides, in relevant part: \"The district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to... produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal... The order may be made pursuant to... the application of any interested person\"\".\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 142, 146.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 145.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal Findings in Respect of the Discovery in the ProEnergy Proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nIt is a fact that Respondent\u2019s application for discovery before a US court concerned ProEnergy as the defendant and not BEL or Balkan. That the Claimant in this case decided to intervene and file submissions in respect of that application is quite natural as the discovery concerned documents of relevance for this arbitration. The Tribunal is of the view that none of these steps can be considered to amount to a breach of the arbitration agreement. Had the Respondent applied to this Tribunal for discovery of documents produced in litigation before the US courts it is quite likely that it would not have succeeded for want of jurisdiction as ProEnergy is not a Party to this arbitration.\n\n493.\n\nThe fact that the Claimant had the opportunity to be heard in the discovery proceedings, including in respect of its argument that discovery could not be granted when there were arbitration proceedings pending, is well established and thus the Claimant has not been put to any disadvantage in the context of such discovery application. Respondent\u2019s arguments to the effect that there are no rules preventing discovery from a third party while the arbitration is pending is correct. It would be of course different if the discovery proceedings were to interfere with the conduct of the arbitration, for example because of an injunction or suspension order, but that is not the case here.\n\n494.\n\nJust as the Tribunal granted a prolonged schedule for submissions so as to take into account what could be the decision of the Ghanaian courts, it can equally take into account other relevant documents produced in discovery to the extent that they are helpful to decide the dispute before it. And the actual fact is that these documents were of importance in respect of many issues before the Tribunal.\n\n**3. The Ghanaian Court Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n495.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent has also violated the Arbitration Agreement \"by continuing to prosecute litigation in the Ghanaian courts\", which, consequently, has again required the Claimant to respond.699 As set out above in the Statement of Facts, the Claimant emphasizes that the Respondent took the following additional steps to advance its interests before the Ghanaian courts:\n\n\u25aa \"While the trial was yet to commence in the High Court of Ghana, [Ghana] filed an application with the Ghanaian Supreme Court to determine whether the PPA and the Arbitration Agreement constitute international business transiterions within the meaning of the Ghanaian Constitution.\"700\n\n\u25aa \"In May 2011 the Ghanaian High Court denied referral of the questions to the Ghanaian Supreme Court.\"701\n\n\u25aa \"In July 2011, the [Government of Ghana] filed a Motion on Notice to invoke Supervisory Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in the Supreme Court of Ghana challenging the High Court\u2019s ruling denying referral.\"702\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 351.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 351.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 351 ; Exhibit C-49; \"Ruling of High Court\".\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 351 ; Exhibit C-50: \"Motion on Notice to Invoke Supervisory Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\"\n\n**(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nThe Respondent counters the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the proceedings before the Ghanaian courts violate the Arbitration Agreement. First, the Respondent argues that had \"the Tribunal viewed those proceedings as a breach of the arbitration agreement, it presumably would have granted, rather than denied, Balkan\u2019s request for an injunction of those proceedings\"703 Second, the Respondent argues that the schedule for this arbitration set by the Tribunal expressly allowed for a reference of the constitutional issue to the Supreme Court.704 In its Interim Award, the Tribunal noted its willingness to adjust the schedule of this arbitration \"to consider and take fully into account the views of the Ghanaian courts on the issues raised with regard to the applicability of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution\".705 Third, the Respondent submits that the Ghanaian proceedings \"involve additional parties who are not parties to the Arbitration Agreement and are, as such, not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal\".706 Finally, the Respondent asserts that it has not misrepresented this Tribunal\u2019s interim Award before the United States or Ghanaian courts, \"as Balkan did to the U.S. Court, in the discovery proceedings against ProEnergy\"707\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 147; Interim Award, para, 190; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 155.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 147.\n\nStatement of Defense, para, 147; Interim Award, paras. 63, 192; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 155.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 147.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 148 ; Exhibit R-42: \"Order, *Government of Ghana* v. *ProEnergy Servs.,* LLC, et at, No. 11-9002\".\n\n497.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent further submits that, while the Supreme Court Judgment states that \"the Arbitration Agreement was not an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Constitution\"708 there was no finding that the proceedings in Ghana themselves violated the Arbitration Agreement; \"nor could it\" because those proceedings involve parties not privy to the Arbitration Agreement to the PPA.709\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the crux of the Respondent\u2019s case is that the Supreme Court of Ghana labelled the PPA as an international business transaction within the meaning of Article 181(5) of the Ghanaian Constitution, and therefore understands that the introduction of the word \"not\" at para. 155 of its Rejoinder is nothing but a mistake. This is confirmed, for instance, at paras 17 and 24 of the Rejoinder.\n\nRejoinder, para. 155.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Breach of the Arbitration Agreement by Virtue of the Ghanaian Court Proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that proceedings before the Ghanaian courts could be held to be in breach of the arbitration agreement, as argued by the Claimant. Had such proceedings or any decision adopted thereunder interfered with the progress of this arbitration or with the authority of this Tribunal to properly conduct its business the conclusion might have been different. But that was not the case and in fact, as the Respondent notes, in its Interim Award the Tribunal denied the Claimant\u2019s request for an injunction of such proceedings because no such interference arose from t\u00edre Ghanaian courts, in its Interim Submission of 20 June 2012 the Claimant has requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision on anti-suit injunction, a request which the Tribunal denied.\n\n499.\n\nIt is also to be kept in mind that, as also noted by the Respondent, the schedule of this arbitration was longer than usual so as to allow prudent time for the Supreme Court to make its views on the constitutional issues of the case known. It should also be noted that if such views had not become available at a time compatible with the schedule of the arbitration it is quite likely that the Tribunal would have continued to move forward in the discharge of its dudes, but this was not the case. As there has been no interference with this arbitration by the proceedings before the Supreme Court, nor any interference of this arbitration with the Ghanaian court proceedings, the arbitration agreement has been duly complied with. Accordingly there is no basis either for the Claimant\u2019s request in the alternative made in the same Interim Submission that the Tribunal should give no weight to the Supreme Court judgment.\n\n**G. The Claimant\u2019s Alternative Claims**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n500.\n\nIn the alternative to its breach of contract claims, the Claimant raises the following additional claims: (a) unjust enrichment;710 (b) fraud or deceit;711 (c) false arrest;712 and (d) conversion and trespass.713\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 364-370.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 372-377.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 378-381.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 382-386.\n\n501.\n\nThe Respondent addresses each allegation in turn, asserting that the Claimant has not established any of these claims and, thus, is not entitled to any such damages.714\n\nStatement of Defense, paras, 150-168.\n\n**2. Unjust Enrichment**\n------------------------\n\n**(a) The Test**\n----------------\n\n502.\n\nThe Claimant submits that both Ghanaian and Dutch law subscribe to the principle of unjust enrichment. The Claimant goes on to cite Article 212 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (the **\"DCCP\"**), which provides as follows:\n\n1. A person who has been unjustifiably enriched at the expense of another is obliged, insofar as reasonable, to make good the other\u2019s loss up to the amount of his enrichment.\n\n2. The enrichment shall not be taken into consideration to the extent that it is decreased by reason of circumstances for which the person enriched is accountable.\n\n3. An enrichment shall be discounted to the extent that it is decreased during a period in which the person enriched could not reasonably be expected to recognize the existence of an obligation to wake good the other\u2019s loss. In determining such decrease account must be taken of any expenditure which would not have been incurred but for the enrichment.715\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 367; Article 12, Book 6 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n503.\n\nThe Respondent endorses the definition of unjust enrichment set out by the Claimant.716\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 150, referring to Statement of Claim, para, 367,\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nIf the PPA indeed required Parliamentary approval, and, as a consequence, is null and void, then the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has been unjustly enriched by all the money, in excess of USD 40 million, expended by the Claimant in connection with the Barge.717 In this regard, the Claimant maintains that it \"is entitled to restitution of all the money it has expended under the PPA under the foregoing principle of failure of consideration\".718\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 368.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 370.\n\n505.\n\nIn further support of its unjust enrichment claim, the Claimant submits that Ghanaian law recognizes the following common law notions of equity, as paraphrased by the Claimant:\n\n\u25aa \u2018[W]here money has been paid under a transaction that is or becomes ineffective, the payer may recover the value of the money paid provided that the consideration for the payment has totally failed.\"719\n\n\u25aa \"If a contract is void ab initio for informality or incapacity, or if the contract is discharged automatically, as in the case of frustration, any payment or credit received made under the apparent, contract is recoverable.\"720\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 369; *Chilly on Contracts,* 13th ed., Vol. 1, at 1869.\n\nStatement of Claim, para, 369; *Chitty on Contracts,* 13th ed., Vol. I, at 1873, para. 29-058, 1885, para. 29-074; *Kennedy* v, *Thomassen* [1929] 1 Ch. 426.\n\n**(c) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n506.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s claim for unjust enrichment should be denied for the following four reasons.721 First, the Respondent submits that it has not received a benefit. In this regard, the Respondent emphasizes that to-date, \"the Power Station remains unfinished and incapable of generating any power whatsoever for Ghana.\"722\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 3 50.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 151.\n\n507.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s calculation of damages is improperly based \"upon the wholesale submission of invoices it claims to have paid to ProEnergy and others\", which \"fails to take into account any of its own allegations [in the ProEnergy Litigation] regarding improper invoicing, double billing, or corrective work\".723\n\nStatement of Defense, paras. 152-153; Exhibit R-7: \"Deposition of Phillip David Elders, *ProEnergy Services, LLC* v. *Balkan Energy Co.,* No. 09-4026\", at 127:9-10, 184:8-12.\n\n508.\n\nThird, the Respondent asserts that the documents related to the Claimant\u2019s settlement with ProEnergy in their US litigation \"may well, in and of itself, demonstrate offsets to the amount Balkans [sic] seeks here\".724\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 154.\n\n509.\n\nFourth, the Respondent contends that the invoices submitted by the Claimant as attachments to the Witness Statement of Neil Crouch725 do not evidence any costs related to the commissioning of the Barge. Rather, the Respondent asserts that these invoices include the following:\n\n\u25aa \"payment made to an Elias Assouad in Lebanon in January 2011 which appear to be for a contract between Mr. Assouad\u2019s company and Balkan... U.S. for a success fee in this arbitration\"726\n\n\u25aa \"an unexplained wire transfer from Synteck West, Inc. to Control Risks in January 2010 A (after Balkan, but its own admission, ceased all work on the Barge) and which contains no description of services\"727\n\n\u25aa \"payments to Curly Baca & Associates in June 2007 for hotel, meals and car rental in connection with their consulting advice to EPC international, Inc. in drafting BEL\u2019s PPA i.e., an expense relating to the attempt to obtain the assignment [of the PPA from Balkan US to BEL])\".728\n\n\u25aa \"a payment to Tower Executive Suites in Sugar Land, Texas for Phillip Elders, as well as a payment for his laptop\";729 and\n\n\u25aa \"[o]ther exhibits simply consist of flights, hotels, and expenses with no specific information attributable to the commission process.\"730\n\nExhibit C-37: Witness Statement of Neil Crouch.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 155; Exhibit C-37, Attachment 23 : \"Assouad - Ghana Invoices.\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para, 155; Exhibit C-37, Attachment 26: \"Control Risks - Ghana Invoices.\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 155; Exhibit C-37, Attachment 28: \"Curly Baca & Assoc - Ghana Invoices.\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 155; Exhibit C-37, Attachment 29: \"Dell Marketing - Ghana Invoices\"; Attachment 54: \"Tower Executive - Ghana Invoices.\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 155; Exhibit C-37, Attachment 36: \"First Bankcard - Ghana Invoices\", at 3. Respondent draws attention to this internal accounting e-mail to Phillip Elders, in which it. is noted that \"Phil does not respond to our request for receipts [sic] or descriptions of highlighted purchases.\"\n\n510.\n\nThe Respondent does not address the Claimant\u2019s unjust enrichment claim further in its Rejoinder.\n\n511.\n\nIn its opening statement at the Hearing on the Merits, the Respondent made its position clear:\n\n\"If you\u2019ve done work, you are entitled to be paid for that work; not under the contract damages, but you are entitled to be paid.\"731 However, the Respondent also submits that the difficulty with Balkan's claim for unjust enrichment is that it utterly fails for want of proof To prevail on a claim for unjust enrichment, Balkan was required, as part of its ease in-chief, to present evidence as to the value of the benefit conferred. What did Balkan do? Balkan presented invoices and spreadsheets showing the money that it spent, [...] money spent does not necessarily equal benefit conferred.732\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 117:13-17.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 117:18-118:3.\n\n512.\n\nSpecifically with respect to the invoices submitted by the Claimant in this arbitration, the Respondent asserts that,\n\nunder a best case scenario, approximately [USD] 20 million - not [USD] 56 million, not [USD] 60 million, not [USD] 140 million - approximately USD] 20 million appears to be for invoices for work on the barge. A lot of invoices for iTunes and things like that. But when we talk about work on the barge, it\u2019s less than [USD] 20 million; and many of those [USD] 20 million consist of inflated and unjustified invoices that provided no benefit to the barge.733\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript Day 1, 118: 10-18.\n\n513.\n\nThe Respondent further remarked upon what it characterizes as \"an extraordinary omission\" of evidence as to the condition of the Barge today; particularly in light of the fact that the Claimant still retains control over the Barge today.734 The Respondent\u2019s position at the Hearing on the Merits was that, having exercised control over the Barge from the time of the signing of the PPA until today, the Claimant was \"then charged with the obligation to maintain the systems that they say that they worked on; and there is no evidence - none - that Balkan has maintained those systems for the past four years since 2009 and since the commencement of this arbitration.\"735 The Respondent emphasizes that \"[w]e have no evidence as to the condition, and we have no evidence whatsoever - not one exhibit - that tells us about maintenance.\"736\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day.1, 118:20-119:1.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 119:11-18.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 120: 4-6.\n\n514.\n\nIn support of its assertion regarding the lack of evidence, and its consequences on the determination of quantum, the Respondent draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Mr. Elder\u2019s 2007 PPA tariff analysis, attached to his witness statement in this arbitration, which explained to the Ministry of Energy why BEL should be paid what he indicates it. should be paid, stating, in relevant part: \"[t]he initial reports reveal that minimal to no maintenance and preservation efforts have been committed to the barge for an extended period of time. There are no maintenance and preservation records available.\"737 Further, \"[t]he constant exposure of critical equipment to salt water moisture without operation has resulted in major operation risk.\"738 The Respondent goes on to quote several passages from the 2007 tariff analysis that speak to the decrepit state of the Barge in 2007,739 asserting that the Tribunal is now placed in a position \"to decide an unjust enrichment claim based upon an incomplete presentation of equipment in a saltwater environment, with not only Ansaldo but Balkan itself telling you exactly what that environment can do, and with Balkan telling you why yon need records that show that the equipment has been maintained pursuant to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications\".740\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 120: 18-21, referring to Exhibit C-38, Attachment 11 \"PPA Tariff Analysis Report\", at 2.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 121:7-9, referring to Exhibit C-38, Attachment 11 \"PPA Tariff Analysis Report\", at 2.\n\n*See* Hearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 121-123; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 11 \"PPA Tariff Analysis Report\".\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day i, 324:6-12.\n\n515.\n\nThe Respondent submits that on several occasions it sought to conduct site inspections at the Barge during 2008 and 2009, but \"were either put off or they were denied or they were given limited access or they were unable to verify\"741 The Respondent\u2019s following line of argument appears to request that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference from the Claimant\u2019s inability to furnish test results on the critical systems on the Barge - \"the only reason that you don\u2019t provide tests and that you don\u2019t allow site visits and that you don\u2019t agree to an independent person coming in to look is because you don't have the tests, you can\u2019t support the claim, you have something to hide\"742\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 124:24-25.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 127:19-23.\n\n516.\n\nThe Respondent also points to ProEnergy\u2019s daily reports *(e.g,* partially excerpted above in the Facts section), arguing that \"those documents actually show how this commissioning effort went wildly astray from the start.\"743\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 1, 128:19-20; for more detail on Respondent\u2019s account of what went wrong *see* 128:21 *et seq.*\n\n517.\n\nFinally, in its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent makes reference to a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Ghana.744 which provides that a contract that has been declared *void ab initio* for breach of a constitutional provision cannot create any rights, therefore precluding the grant of any restitutionary remedy.745\n\n*Amida v. Attorney General, Waterville Holdings, et al.,* No. JI/15/2012, 14th June 2013\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 170.\n\n**(d) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Unjust Enrichment**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThe fact that both Parries agree on the definition of unjust enrichment is helpful to the Tribunal as this is a concept that has lent itself to many interpretations some of which are imprecise. The essence of the concept is thus that a benefit has been conferred on the other party without compensation and where such compensation would be reasonably expected.\n\n519.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s justification for its alternative claim on unjust enrichment is based on the premise that if the PPA is declared null and void then the Respondent would have been as a consequence unjustly enriched in the amount of money expended on the Barge. Restitution of such money would then be the appropriate remedy under the principle of failure of consideration. The fact of the matter, however, is that the Tribunal has found above that the PPA is \"valid\" and creates obligations for the Parties. Moreover, in the Respondent\u2019s view, no such benefit could have been received as the Power Station remains unfinished and incapable of generating energy. As the Tribunal has found above on the issue of testing and commissioning of the Power Station there is indeed no production capacity at present and accordingly no power is being delivered to Ghana. Were this a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with its obligations under the PPA, particularly in terms of grid connectivity, a benefit would have been readily identifiable, but the ultimate reason for this failure lies not fully with the Respondent.\n\n520.\n\nThe Parries are in any event in disagreement about the calculation and amount of damages. While the Claimant estimates such damages in excess of US$ 40 million, the Respondent believes that the expenses were at most one half of that amount as many invoices submitted were questioned in the ProEnergy Litigation by Claimant itself, while other invoices are not related to the commissioning of the Barge. The Respondent has rightly noted in this respect that the evidence must be specifically related to the benefit conferred and not simply to the addition of expenses. The Parties have also disputed whether there was any proper maintenance of the systems on the Barge, which as the Tribunal has also found above was in the best of cases minimal and could hardly be considered as conferring a benefit to the Respondent. Requests for site inspections were not successful in many cases and thus the possibility of ascertaining the state of maintenance and repair has also remained in doubt.\n\n521.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers that this alternative claim suffers from a partial lack of proof of benefit conferred, this does not mean that damages are to be ruled out in the light of the fact that the Respondent also has responsibility for not having complied fully and timely with its obligations under the PPA concerning site electricity, grid connectivity and other matters, in such case, however, damages are the consequence of liability for contract breach. The question of damages in this other context will be considered below but the Tribunal must note that Respondent\u2019s invocation of a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Ghana, establishing that a. contract declared *void ab initio* for breach of a constitutional provision cannot create any rights, and therefore precludes the grant of any restitutionary remedy, is not to be sustained, partly because no such nullity was found by the Tribunal and partly because rights can even be created in such circumstances if the Government bears responsibility for such breach, as is the case here.\n\n**3. Fraud or Deceit**\n----------------------\n\n**(a) The Test**\n----------------\n\n522.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the tort of deceit provides a civil remedy for a party who has relied on a false representation where the following elements of the tort are made out;\n\n1. A party has made a representation to another party which is false;\n\n2. The first party making the representation knew that it was false or was reckless as to the truth of the statement;\n\n3. There was an intention to deceive;\n\n4. The representation was acted upon; and\n\n5. Loss is suffered as a consequence.746\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 373; *Cavel USA Inc.* v. *Seaton Insurance Co.,* [2008] EWHC 3043 (Comm.); *Bradford Building Society v. Borders* [1941] 2 All E,R.. 205, at 211; *R.F.V. Heustons Salmond on the Law of Torts,* 17th ed. (**\"Salmond\"**), at 387, para. 140.\n\n523.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this common law test for deceit is reflected in Article 162 of the DCCP, as well as in Ghanaian law by virtue of Article 11(1) of the Constitution.747\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 371-372; Article 162, Book 6 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n524.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest the Claimant\u2019s characterization of the test for deceit.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it was \"induced\" to enter into the PPA based on its reliance on the representations provided by the then Attorney General, Mr. Ghartey, in two legal opinions dated 26 October 2007, in which he stated that Ghana had the power to enter into the PPA and Lease of the Project Site.748 The Claimant further asserts that Ghana\u2019s conduct from 2007-2009 \"represented and implied that BE[L]... had a valid agreement going so far as to fix and demand BE[L]...\u2019s performance thereunder.\"749\n\nStatement of Claim, para, 374; Notice of Arbitration, Exhibit 8: (1) \"Operationalising the Osayefo Barge, Legal Opinion by the Attorney - General, 26 October 2007\"; (2) \"Legal Opinion, Power Purchase Agreement Between the Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited, 26 October 2007\"; Interim Award, para. 37.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 374.\n\n526.\n\nThe Claimant thereby contends that it is entitled to damages in the amount it would have received under the PPA or, alternatively, the amount it has actually spent on the Barge project.750\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 377.\n\n527.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant asserts that the PPA \"gave rise to an implied warranty or express obligation on the part of the Respondent\", including the warranty that, under Clause 7.2(i) of the PPA, it \"supply to BE[L] \u2018issuance of a letter from the Government of Ghana that ah required approvals from the relevant authorities in Ghana had been obtained\"\u2019.751 Further, under Clause 2.6 of the PPA, the Claimant submits that the Respondent \"obligated itself to promptly facil\u00edtate the acquisition of all government approvals for the project.\"752\n\nReply, para. 156.\n\nReply, para. 156.\n\n528.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, despite these implied condition precedents at the charge of the Respondent, it understands the Respondent's position to be that \"its Attorney General made a legal mistake of a matter of first impression... and accordingly, no liability can attach.\" The Claimant further alleges that the Respondent has failed to present any other evidence that it indeed undertook steps to obtain the necessary Constitutional approval.753 In its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant makes reference to the testimony of Ms. Gadzekpo, who according to the Claimant impliedly confirmed that the Respondent made a deliberate decision not to seek parliamentary approval of the BEL PPA.754\n\nReply, para. 157.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 139. The Claimant does not refer to the page of the Hearing Transcript where this statement is made.\n\n529.\n\nThe Claimant argues that to the extent that the Respondent contends that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion letters were not a warranty, the content of those letter constitute a statement of fact.755 The Claimant further submits that \"U.K. law has long-recognized that matters of opinion that are reduced to warranties under a contract are actionable.\"756\n\nReply, paras. 158-160; *Smith Land & House Property Corp.,* 1884, 28 Chancery Division 7.\n\nReply, para. 158; *Esso Petroleum Co., Ltd.* v. *Phillip Lionel Warden,* 1976 EWC Cov. 4 (6 February 1996).\n\n**(c) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that the Claimant\u2019s claims for fraud and deceit fail for the following two reasons.757 First, the Respondent argues that the former Ghanaian Attorney General\u2019s opinion regarding the interpretation of Article 181(5) of the Constitution is not actionable as a matter of law.758 The Respondent also draws attention to Clause 31 of the PPA, in which the Parties acknowledge that in executing the PPA, each party \"has relied solely on its judgment, belief, and knowledge, and such advice as it may have received from its own counsel and it has not been influenced by any representation or statements made by any other party or such party\u2019s counsel\".759\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 156.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 157; John Cartwright, *Misrepresentation, Mistake and Non-Disclosure,* 56 n. 82 (2007); \"the mistake or misrepresentation of the legal effect of an agreement might well continue not generally to be actionable since normally a party should take his own advice on the matter.\"\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 157; Clause 31 of the PPA; *see* also Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 195.\n\n531.\n\nIn further support for its assertion that the Claimant\u2019s alleged reliance on the opinion of the former Attorney General is of no consequence in this arbitration, the Respondent relies on the following authorities; *Airtno\u00fcve Engineering Corp.* v. *United States,760 Tuffuor v. Attorney-General,761 Attorney-General* v. *Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd.762 United States v. Marine Shale Processors763* and *Rhyl Urban DC v. Rhyl Amusement Ltd.764*\n\n*Airmotive Engineering Corp,* v. *United States,* 535 F, 2d 8, at 1.1 (Ct. Cl. 1976).\n\n*Tuffuor v. Attorney-General* [1980] G.L.R. 147, at 157.\n\n*Attorney-General v. Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd.* [2005-2006] SCGLR 271, at 306.\n\n*United States* v. *Marine Shale Processors,* 81 F. 3d 1329, at 1348 (5th Cir. 1996).\n\n*Rhyl Urban DC* v. *Rhyl Amusement Ltd.* [1959] J W.L.R. 465, at 466 (citing *\u2019Westminster City Council v. Haywood (No. 1),* [1998] Ch. 377, at 393). \u2019\n\n532.\n\nSecond, and in the alternative, the Respondent submits that \"even if the Claimant were entitled to rely upon the opinion of the Attorney General, an action for deceit will not lie absent a showing that the Attorney General issued his opinion knowing it to be false at the time it was made\", which it submits the Claimant has not shown765 (The Respondent further emphasizes that the former Attorney General\u2019s opinion was in line with the opinion of the Claimant\u2019s current Ghanaian counsel.)766\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 159.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 159.\n\n533.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s \"recastf[ing]\" of its fraud or deceit claim as one under the PPA for \"implied warranty or express obligation\"767 fails for four reasons.768 First, the Respondent reiterates its assertion that Claimant\u2019s claims fail because the PPA is void *ah initio* as a result of the Supreme Court Judgment.769\n\nReply, para. 155.\n\nRejoinder, para. 156.\n\nRejoinder, para. 156; *see* also Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 195.\n\n534.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that Clause 20 is the only provision of the PPA that refers to a \"warranty\" of any kind between the parties and in that clause it is only the Claimant that warrants to do certain things.770\n\nRejoinder, para. 156.\n\n535.\n\nThird, the Respondent draws attention to Clause 31 of the PPA, regarding \"Joint Effort and Confidentiality\", which it argues \"makes clear that Balkan was not entitled to rely upon the opinion of the Attorney General,\" as each party acknowledges that it has relied solely on its own judgment in entering into the PPA.771\n\nRejoinder, para. 156.\n\n536.\n\nFourth, and finally, the Respondent reiterates its assertion that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion is \"not actionable as a matter of law\",772\n\nRejoinder, para. 156; *see also* Statement of Defense, paras. 156-158.\n\n**(d) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings Concerning the Claim for Fraud or Deceit**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nAgain in this matter the Parties have agreed on the definition of fraud or deceit. The Tribunal has no reason to depart from the test staled and the essentia] characteristics that fraud or deceit involves a deliberate misrepresentation of the truth or the facts so as to induce another party to act to its detriment. Because the Tribunal has held the PPA does impose obligations on the parties thereto, a claim in the alternative to a finding of liability as a consequence of its breach does not have legal support.\n\n538.\n\nEven if this were not the case, it would hardly be conceivable that the two opinions of the Attorney General issued at the time of the negotiation of the PPA were done with the deliberate intention of misrepresenting the law or the facts to the Claimant. There is indeed no evidence of this and none has been argued by the Claimant. The two opinions were indeed relevant to the Claimant\u2019s decision to finalize the negotiation of the PPA and so was the continuing conduct of the Respondent to consider the PPA as a valid agreement. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s understanding that it had obtained all required approvals from the relevant authorities as provided for under Clause 7.2 (i) of the PPA, and the commitment under Clause 2.6 that the Government would promptly facilitate the acquisition of all government approvals for the project, are devoid of any intention to commit fraud or deceit. At the most, as the Respondent maintains, it could be considered a legal mistake but not an intentional misrepresentation of the law or the facts.\n\n539.\n\nThe Respondent has also called attention to Clause 31 of the PPA in which each party acknowledges to have relied solely on the advice of its own counsel and has not been influenced by the opinions or statements of the other party or its counsel. The Tribunal does not understand this Clause to mean that the Parties could not have relied on the opinions of public officials or entities entrusted with the role of determining legal matters involved in their transactions. Neither do the allegations concerning implied warranties or express obligations alter the validity of the Government\u2019s legal officers\u2019 opinions. The Respondent maintains that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion on interpretation of the Constitution is not actionable as a matter of law, and that in any event the PPA is void as a result of the Supreme Court judgment. However, the Tribunal does not consider that this is the case, especially where the rights of investors are affected by such an opinion.\n\n**4. False Arrest**\n-------------------\n\n**(a) The Test**\n----------------\n\n540.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"fljalse arrest or false imprisonment is the act of arresting or imprisoning any person without lawful justification, or otherwise preventing him from exercising his right of leaving the place where he is.\"773 A defendant may be held liable in Ghana for this charge if it authorized or directed a particular arrest.774 The Respondent does not contest the Claimant\u2019s characterization in this regard.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 379; Salmond, at 123.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 379; *Adejumo v. Abegunde* [1965] G.L.R. 499; Yaw v. *Bekoe* [ 1934] Div. Ct. 31-37, at 79.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, shortly after it initiated this arbitration, the Respondent \"had Tim Everhart, the General Manager of BE[L]... arrested, stripped to his underwear, placed in jail, not allowed to contact an attorney, and initially not allowed to contact the American Embassy\".775 Mr. Everhart was arrested on the suspicion that he was stealing the DCS from the Power Station.776 The Claimant contends that Mr. Everhart was merely directing the movement of BEL\u2019s own DCS from the Barge to a locked air-conditioned administrative office elsewhere on the Project Site.777 The Claimant further asserts that the \"timing of the arrest... on such frivolous grounds readily shows that it was in retaliation for BE[L]... filing... the arbitration proceedings\".778 The Claimant argues that the arrest had a \"chilling effect\" on other BEL employees.779\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 378.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 378.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 380.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 380.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 381.\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Reply does not address the points raised by the Respondent in its Statement of Defense, described below.\n\n543.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the. Claimant cites the *Mogotey* v. *Asare* case780 which details the factors to be taken into account in awarding general damages for false imprisonment. According to the Claimant, \"substantial damages might be awarded for the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s dignity, discomfort or inconvenience even where there has been neither physical injury nor loss of pecuniary damages. The time, place and manner of the trespass and the conduct of the defendant might be taken into account.\"781\n\n*Mogotes v. Asare,* 2 GLR 77 (1989-90).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 132.\n\n**(c) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s claim for false arrest should be dismissed on the following three grounds. First, the Claimant has no standing to assert such a claim on behalf of Mr. Everhart, and does not refer to any legal authority to support its right to do so.782\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 161.\n\n545.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that even if Mr. Everhart chose to pursue a personal claim, he is not a party to the Arbitration Agreement at issue in this arbitration, thus the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in this regard.783\n\nStatement of Defense, para, 162.\n\n546.\n\nThird, Ghana\u2019s Bureau of National Investigation (the **\"BNI\"**) had just cause \"to believe that key equipment necessary for the operation of the Power Station was being removed from the premises\" and, accordingly, \"the officer acted under proper authority io make the arrest based upon his reasonable suspicion that property was being removed, or about to be removed\".784\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 163.\n\n547.\n\nin its Rejoinder, the Respondent notes that the Claimant\u2019s Reply does not address any of the points the Respondent raised in its Statement of Defense, except to provide further statements from Messrs. Berkenbile and Everhart regarding the latter's arrest785 The Respondent also relies on the Witness Statements of Messrs, Moro Adama and Reuben Yao Dugah, which purportedly shed further light on the events related to Mr. Everhart\u2019s arrest.786\n\nRejoinder, para. 157.\n\nRejoinder, para. 157.\n\n548.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent notes that at the hearing the Claimant did not address the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimant lacks standing to assert a claim of false arrest on behalf of Mr. Everhart, nor did it introduce any evidence.787\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 196.\n\n**(d) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on False Arrest**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nIn respect of this claim the Parties have also not disagreed on the definition of what constitutes false arrest but have strongly disagreed about the facts of the Claimant\u2019s allegations. It is an established fact, however, that officers of the Bureau of National Investigation arrested Mr. Tim Everhart, BEL\u2019s General Manager, shortly after the initiation of this arbitration, Mr. William Berkenbile was also detained on this occasion. Although the treatment Mr. Everhart, received on being arrested has been to an extent disputed, it is also a fact that he was placed in jail, and was unable to contact an attorney and was without access to the United States consular official or some other official that could have intervened at that point.\n\n550.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s explanation for this arrest was the BNI\u2019s suspicion that Mr. Everhart was removing or about to remove the DCS equipment from the Power Station, and that in any event the officer in charge acted under proper authority. The Claimant has disputed this assertion maintaining that Mr. Everhart was merely directing the movement of BEL\u2019s own DCS to a different location on the Project Site. The evidence on the circumstances of the arrest is not quite clear'. While the witness statements of Messrs. Moro Adama and Reuben Yao Dugah reiterate the facts as explained by the Respondent, the Tribunal is not convinced that on moving the equipment there was any intention to illegitimately appropriate the equipment.\n\n551.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is uncomfortable with the fact that this arrest took place at a time that gives credibility to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that it was in retaliation for the Claimant filing the arbitration. Even though there is no specific evidence to link these two facts the mere circumstance that they coincided in their timing does not allow\u2019 the Tribunal to reject the Claimant\u2019s allegations. It should also be noted that the assertion by the Respondent\u2019s witness that the officers involved had been instructed by their superiors in Accra and were therefore acting under proper authority788 necessarily rules out that this was the result of a mistake of an uninformed local officer.\n\nHearing on the Merits Transcript, Day 6 (Cross-examination of Moro Adama), 136:13-137:25.\n\n552.\n\nIrrespective of this coincidence in time, if is equally regrettable that the arrests took place at all and in conditions that do not appear to have duly taken into account the rights of the accused or their dignity. The Claimant\u2019s reliance on the *Mogotey v. Asare* case as authority for the award of general damages for false imprisonment and the injury sustained by the affected persons in terms of his dignity, discomfort or inconvenience, even in the absence of physical injury or pecuniary loss, appears to the Tribunal to be a powerful statement of the law and is also reasonable.\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal will accordingly take these considerations into account on determining the issue of damages. In the view of the Tribunal, when the normal conduct of business is affected by such an arrest the question is no longer one that involves a personal claim by the person concerned. It is the business as a whole that suffers the consequences. The Respondent\u2019s assertion that Mr. Everhart has no standing in this arbitration because he is not a party to the arbitration agreement will accordingly not be sustained by the Tribunal because what is at issue here is not only the personal inconvenience of the person arrested but also the interference with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Claimant. The Tribunal cannot disregard either of these considerations.\n\n**5. Conversion and Trespass**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Test**\n----------------\n\n554.\n\nThe key elements of the tort of conversion are as follows:.\n\n1. Possession of good to which the defendant is not the owner: and\n\n2. An intent to deny the owner\u2019s right or assert an inconsistent right.789\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"even a temporary taking can constitute a conversion.\"790\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 383; Salmond, at 95.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 383; Salmond, at 96.\n\n555.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that trespass \"is defined as the immediate and authorized direct interference with another's goods\". To prove trespass, a deliberate interference with another\u2019s goods must be established.791\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 384; Salmond, at 91.\n\n556.\n\nThe Respondent does not object to the definitions and corresponding tests for conversion and trespass, respectively, set out by the Claimant.792\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 150, referring to Statement of Claim, para. 367.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent seized the DCS from the Project Site and detained it for approximately five months.793 Without the DCS, the Claimant alleges that it could not control and operate the Power Station.794 The Claimant further alleges that the seizure compromised the integrity of the DCS, such that it could not be used after its return because the Claimant \"had no way to ensure the integrity and safety of the programming on the DCS after it had been out of its possession\".795 As a result, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s seizing of the DCS constitutes both a conversion and a trespass of the Claimant\u2019s rights in the DCS, which it asserts will cost USD 2,586 million to replace.796\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 382.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 382.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 382.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 386.\n\n558.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Reply does not address the Respondent\u2019s arguments, described below. The Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission largely reproduces the arguments submitted in the Statement of Claim and adds a reference to the *Standard Chartered Bank* case, which provides a criterion to quantify the damages for trespass to goods.797\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Submission, para. 134.\n\n**(c) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant's claims for conversion and trespass fail as a matter of law under the applicable legislation in Ghana, In support, the Respondent refers to Section 94 of Ghana\u2019s Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which empowers a police officer to seize, without a warrant, any property which he or she has reasonable cause to believe has been stolen.798 The Respondent also refers to Section 40 of the Security and Intelligence Agencies Act, 1996 (Act 526), which it says \"gives officers of the BNI the same powers as those conferred on the police\".\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 1.65.\n\n560.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the Claimant\u2019s admitted attempt to remove the DCS from the Barge indeed \"supports what BNI was told, (namely) that essential systems were being removed from the Power Station\".799\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 166.\n\n561.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that, as of late December 2009, the Claimant ceased all its efforts on the Barge.800 As a result, the Respondent submits that it had reasonable cause to believe that BEL \"took the DCS... from the Control System with the idea of removing it from the Project Site altogether, thus making it impossible for the Government to operate the Barge should Balkan lose the arbitration or abandon the site\".801\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 167.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 167.\n\n562.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the DCS was of questionable integrity upon its return, the Respondent points out that the Claimant \"could have tested the system as it requested both ABB and Taurus to do in 2008\".802\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 168; Exhibit R-31: \"Email from Scott Kinney to J.D. Robinson, Re: Osagyefo Power Barge\"; Exhibit R-28: \"ABB, Survey Intervent System Offshore GTPP in Ghana\"; Exhibit R-29: \"ABB, S/S Barge - Effasu 161 kV (Ghana), Retrofit plan for Protection amd Control System, Technical Description\".\n\n563.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not address this claim in its Reply, \"presumably recognizing that the claim fails as a matter of law\".803 The Respondent makes a similar observation in its Post-Hearing Submission, arguing that the Claimant did not introduce any new evidence or presented any new argument at the hearing.804\n\nRejoinder, para. 158.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 194.\n\n**(d) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings Concerning Conversion and Trespass**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nThe final alternative claim concerns Claimant\u2019s allegation of conversion and trespass on the part of the Respondent. Again here there is no disagreement between the Parties as to the meaning of these concepts. It is an established fact that the Respondent, seized the DCS equipment at the at the time of the arrests discussed above. Whether this happened at the Project Site as argued by the Claimant or elsewhere is immaterial as it is also a fact that the Respondent kept this equipment for a period far too long to that, needed to investigate who was the owner, it must be recalled that the reason offered by the Respondent for the arrests was that Mr. Everhart was removing property that did not belong to him or to BEL. The Claimant maintains that the DCS was kept by the Respondent for approximately five months. The precise period during which the Respondent retained the DCS is not clear but what is clear is that the equipment was tampered with to an extent that has no connection to the determination of the ownership of the equipment. This was most likely not done by the local police or investigative officers but by some institution higher up in the chain of command.\n\n565.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s argument to the effect that it could not control and operate the Power Station without the equipment is formally true but as the Tribunal has found that the Power Station was nowhere close to completion the equipment could hardly have been a factor for the operation of the Power Station at the time. What is nonetheless convincing is the Claimant\u2019s assertion that manipulation of the equipment compromised its integrity and safety as its programming functions could no longer be relied upon. It is true that the Claimant could have tested the equipment as the Respondent argues but the fact of the matter is that confidence in its proper functioning could not be reestablished after such manipulation. The Claimant puts the replacement cost at USD 2,586 million. The Tribunal will discuss this damage further below with particular reference to the time period in which damages might be compensable.\n\n566.\n\nThe Respondent has argued in its defense that under the Ghanaian Code of Criminal Procedure a police officer is empowered to seize property without a warrant when it believes that it has been stolen or dishonestly received. Even if this had been the case, there still would be no justification for keeping the equipment for such a prolonged period of time. In the view' of the Tribunal, the suggestion that BEI, was attempting to remove the equipment to make it impossible for the Government to operate the Barge in case the arbitration was lost or Claimant abandoned the site is not credible, It appears to be a farfetched proposition without any supporting evidence.\n\n**H. The Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim**\n------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nThe Respondent originally advanced two counterclaims in this arbitration: first, that the Claimant has breached the PPA; and second, that the Claimant made several material misrepresentations to it regarding its experience and capability of operating liquid/gas fired power plants and that it could commission the Power Station within ninety (90) working days of the Effective Date of the PPA.805 As noted above, the second counterclaim was withdrawn. Accordingly, the Tribunal will in the following only address the first counterclaim, which it is called to decide upon.\n\nStatement of Defense, para. 173; *see also* paras. 28, 33; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 6: MOU; Attachment 7: Proposal.\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nIf the Tribunal determines that the PPA is enforceable, notwithstanding the Supreme Court Judgment that it is void *ab initio,* the Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare the Claimant in default, terminate the PPA, and award the Respondent damages in the amount of USD 300,000 for breach of contract, pursuant to Clause 14.2 of the PPA.806\n\nRejoinder, para. 159; *see also* Statement of Defense, paras. 170-172.\n\n569.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates that the Claimant was required to complete the commissioning of the Power Station by March 2008.807 The Respondent asserts that at no time did the Government declare a default or implicitly extend this March date under Clause 7.3 of the PPA in response to the Claimant\u2019s claims regarding site electricity.808 The Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant represented that it could complete the commissioning process within thirty days of connecting to the National Grid:809 however, this did not occur, even after the Respondent says it energised the Essiama and Elubo Transmission Lines, on 8 August 2008 and 13 November 2008, respectively.810 Based on the foregoing, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant \"could, and should, have completed its commissioning work and been ready for Final Performance Testing within thirty (30) days of either of those lines being energized\"811 The Respondent purports that the Claimant, \"by its own admission\", \"was still months away from even being able to fire the turbines\" and, moreover, did nothing to make the Barge operational in 2009.812\n\nRejoinder, para. 159; *see also* Statement of Defense, para. 171, wherein the Respondent argues that \"Balkan has failed to commission the Power Station within 150 working days after the Effective Date, even assuming, for sake of argument, that the Completion Date were extended based upon delays attributable to site electricity or the Transmission Lines.\"\n\nRejoinder, para. 159.\n\nRejoinder, para. 159; Exhibit C-38, Attachment 106: \"BE[L] letter re: Commissioning Project\"; Attachment 116: \"BEfLj re: lack of grid connectivity\"; Attachment 118: \"BE[L] letter re: Grid Connectivity\".\n\nRejoinder, para. 159.\n\nRejoinder, para. 159.\n\nRejoinder, para. 159.\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n570.\n\nThe Claimant does not respond to the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim, save to assert that \"the Respondent sets forth no precedent or legal authority to enunciate for the Tribunal the elements of proof for the referenced claims, nor an enumeration of the evidence it has adduced that could be claims to establish that element under the use at trial rule.\"813\n\nReply, para. 161.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s remaining counterclaim concerns the alleged breach of the PPA by the Claimant. This counterclaim is also made in the alternative, as it can only stand in case the Tribunal finds the PPA to be enforceable, contrary to Respondent\u2019s main argument that the PPA is void *ab initio.* This is indeed what the Tribunal has found in this case.\n\n572.\n\nThe Respondent requests that in that case the Tribunal should declare that the Claimant is in default, terminate the PPA and award damages in the amount of USD 300,000 for breach of contract as provided for under Clause 14.2 of the PPA. The Claimant has not argued in response to this counterclaim although it points to the lack of evidence in support thereof.\n\n573.\n\nTechnically the Claimant is in default as it did not complete the final testing and commissioning of the Power Station by March 2008 or at any relevant time thereafter, nor was the date extended. But the situation was more complex than that. First there were objective problems concerning the availability of site electricity and the connectivity to the National Grid. While many such problems were gradually redressed and as discussed above were not the determinative cause for the non completion of the Power Station, still they represent a partial breach of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under the PPA. It would thus be inappropriate for the Tribunal to declare the default of one party in circumstances that both did not adequately or fully complied with the terms and obligations of the PPA.\n\n**4. Liability and Termination of the PPA**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n574.\n\nFrom the discussion of the facts and the legal arguments set out above the Tribunal can only conclude that both Parties are liable for breach of the PPA. The Claimant is liable for not having completed the testing and commissioning of the Power Station for reasons that, are independent of the Respondent\u2019s breach of its own obligations. The latter breaches relate not only to the absence of site electricity and connectivity to the National Grid but also to the questions of false arrest, conversions and trespass and other issues that have been discussed. Although in the end the breaches by both Parties made the process of commissioning more difficult the respective liabilities are of a different kind, intensity and extent. These considerations will be next taken up by the Tribunal in determining damages.\n\n575.\n\nWhen all the elements involved in this dispute are considered in the aggregate it becomes evident for the Tribunal that the PPA no longer serves a purpose and is incapable of governing the relations between the Parties so as to ensure its objectives, A decision of the Tribunal requiring enforcement of the PPA and strict compliance with its terms would, far from settling the dispute, give rise to continuing confrontation between the Parties. In this light the Tribunal's determination that the PPA is valid is accompanied by the final determination that in the circumstances it is nonetheless not enforceable.\n\n576.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that the termination of the PPA is the only reasonable alternative in the light of the extraordinary circumstances of this dispute and the bitter confrontation between the Parties, taking into account in particular that the PPA is a long term contract the implementation of which would require the active cooperation of the Parties. The essential purpose of the Project embodied in the PPA is thus unattainable.\n\n577.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties are in agreement about this consequence of the breach of the PPA, albeit for different reasons. Indeed, in its letter of 23 April 2013, relating to the submission on damages, the Claimant considers the PPA terminated as of I January 2014, the estimated date of the Tribunal\u2019s Award, due to non-performance by the Respondent going forward. The Respondent also requests the termination of the PPA in the context of its counterclaim.\n\n578.\n\nThe Tribunal has found the PPA valid, but in view of the Parties profound disagreement, it concludes that the PPA has become impossible to be enforced. The Tribunal therefore decides that the PPA be terminated as at the date of this Award, without prejudice to the questions of damages as discussed below.\n\n**VI. DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nCumulatively or in the alternative, the Claimant seeks damages for Tolling Fees, repudiation damages, restitution, and incidental direct damages.814 As set out above, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to establish it is entitled to damages under any of the aforementioned heads of damages. The Tribunal will now assess the damages due as a consequence of its finding that both Parties have liability for breach of the PPA, albeit to a different extent. The Tribunal has found the PPA valid but, in view of the Parties profound disagreements, concludes that it has become unenforceable. It thus finds the PPA to be terminated.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 337-341.\n\n**A. Tolling Fees**\n-------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n580.\n\nThe Claimant seeks damages for the Respondent\u2019s failure to pay Tolling Fees to it pursuant to Clause 11.9 of the PPA. The Claimant submits that Tolling Fees are ongoing. It provided a preliminary accounting of USD 146,938,050815 calculated by Mr. Elders from November 2008 through the date of his witness statement of October 2011 as Attachment 233 to Exhibit C-39, inclusive, with related monthly invoices to the. Respondent at Exhibit C-52.816\n\nThis amount is confirmed by Claimant in its letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 338; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 126, fn. 39: \"Balkan calculates the Toiling Fees in the first invoice as follows: Total kilowatt hours (125MW x 31 days x 24 hours x 90% capacity): 83,700,000 x Fee/kWH:.0497 = USD 4,159,890/month, Balkan then added the Toiling Fees (adjusted only for the number of days in the month), from November 2008 through the date of Mr. Elder's [witness] statement of October 203 1, for a total of USD 146,938,050, reserving the light to supplement its request prior to the final hearing.\"\n\n581.\n\nIn its letter dated 23 April 2013, with attached calculations, the Claimant provided the Tribunal with a \"skeleton of its presentation\" on the amount of damages,817 Therein, the Claimant asserts that it considers the PPA terminated as of 1 January 2014 due to non-performance by the Respondent going forward.818 According to the Claimant, it follows that a distinction must be made between the period leading up to 1 January 2014 and the period thereafter.819 While the Claimant did not previously calculate its damages in two distinct periods, the Tribunal notes that Exhibit C-38, Attachment 234 did contemplate Tolling Fees for the whole duration of the PPA term (20 years) under the heading of Repudiation Damages.820\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 339.\n\n582.\n\nThe Claimant amended its preliminary accounting of the Tolling fees - USD 146,938,050 - on account of not including the interest rate under Article 11.6 of the PPA. Thus, \"[u]p to 1 January 2014, the claim would amount to approximately USD 238,059,975, again excluding interest (see Sheet 3 of the attachment to this letter]. With interest, the claim up to 1 January 2013 would amount to USD 248,993,202.00 (see Sheet 2).\"821 In the alternative, the Claimant asserts that even assuming that the Respondent\u2019s arguments as to the Claimant\u2019s statements made in the ProEnergy case are afforded weight in the present arbitration, the damages under Article 13.9 of the PPA would still amount to USD 205,407,075 without interest (see Sheet 3 to the 23 April 2013 letter), and USD 213,510,647, including interest (see Sheet 4). The Claimant clarifies that these amounts reflect the \"Tolling Fees due from 9 July 2009 (see C38: [Attachment] 157), which is the date that Ansaldo certified \u2018Full Speed No Load\u2019 and noted that Grid Connectivity is necessary for future commissioning milestones\".822\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2. The same figures are reproduced in the Claimant\u2019s PostHearing Submission, para. 126.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.\n\n583.\n\nThe numbers set out in Sheets 1 to 4, attached to the 23 April 2013 letter, appear to be updates of the Claimant\u2019s calculations submitted on 15 October 2011 so as io extend them to periods not covered in the written submissions. However, the figures presented on 23 April 2013 are annual amounts, whereas Exhibit C-38, Attachment 233 presents monthly amounts. Taking the overlapping period November 2008 to June 2011. the following is a summary of the amounts submitted by the Claimant in its 15 October 2011 and 23 April 2013 submissions:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | November 2008 - June 2009 | July 2009 - June 2010 | July 2010 - June 2011 |\n| **Exhibit C-38, Attachment 233** | USD 32,608,170 | USD 48,979,350 | USD 48,979,350 |\n| **Letter of 23 April 2013, Sheet 1** | USD 32,652,900 | USD 48,979,350 | USD 48,979,350 |\n\n584.\n\nAs for the period from 1 January 2014 onwards, in its 23 April 2013 letter, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to its return on investment over the period from 1 January 2014 until the end date of the PPA, which amount to almost 13 years (until 31 October 2027).823 In order to show what BEL\u2019s return on investment would be, the Claimant explains that \"one should look into the PPA. Article 11.1 (ii) thereof provides that the return on investment for Balkan would at least be 15% per year,\"824 Moreover, the Claimant asserts that, using BEL\u2019s Tariff Analysis, which was confirmed by the Respondent in its Inter-Ministerial Committee Report,825 \"the investment under the PPA is clearly established by the Parties, being USD 140 million.\"826 According to the Claimant, \"[t]he above leads to a damages amount, covering 15% over USD 140 million from 1 January 2014 until 31 October 2027, of USD 280,000,000.00. The Net Present Value thereof is USD 259,691,080.00, applying a discount rate of 1.45% (LIBOR + 1%) (see Article 11.6 of the PPA). See Sheet 5.\"827\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 11 \"Balkan\u2019s Tariff Analysis\"; Exhibit R-90 \"Inter-Ministerial Committee Report\"; *see also* Exhibit C-38, Attachment 17, Letter from PURC, dated 9 July 2007.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013, at 2; the same figures are reproduced in the Claimant\u2019s PostHearing Submission, para. 128.\n\n585.\n\nFinally, in its 23 April 2013 letter, the Claimant contends that\n\n[i]f one took the investment actually made today, amounting to USD 55 million (see Mr. N. Crouch\u2019s (supplement to the) Witness Statements), as a basis for the calculations, the return on investment would be USD 114,125,000.00, covering 15% over USD 55 million from 1 January 2014 until 31 October 2027, The Net Present Value thereof would be USD 102,021,496.00, applying a discount rate of 1.45% (LIBOR + 1%). See Sheet 6.828\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter dated 23 April 2013. at 2.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s claim for Tolling Fees under the PPA fails for three independent reasons.829 First, the Respondent states that because the PPA is void *ab initio,* the Claimant\u2019s claim for Tolling Fees created by that contract must also fail as a matter of law.830\n\nRejoinder, para. 123; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 165-168.\n\nRejoinder, para. 124.\n\n587.\n\nSecond, even if the PPA is valid, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it is entitled to Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9.\n\n588.\n\nThird, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s claim for Tolling Fees fails as an \"unenforceable penalty\" under the law of Ghana.831 The Respondent explains that, unlike liquidated damages, the Tolling Fees are not a reasonable pre-contractual estimate of the Claimant\u2019s loss.832 The Respondent argues that the Tolling Fees \"are not in any way tied to Balkan\u2019s actual loss in the event of a breach by the Respondent. Accordingly, they are a penalty\".833\n\nRejoinder, para. 126.\n\nRejoinder, para. 126.\n\nRejoinder, para. 126.\n\n589.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to elaborate on the Ghanaian law governing penalty, followed by its reasoning for why the Toiling Fees are an unenforceable penalty, namely:\n\nFirst, the Tolling Fees do not take into account the month operation and maintenance costs which Balkan would incur in operating the Power Station. The calculation of Tolling Fees is based on gross revenue, rather than net profits and actual damage.\n\nSecond, the Toiling Fees do not compensate for actual loss because they do not take into account the additional financial expenditures that Balkan would be required to make to complete the commissioning process or make the Barge operational.\n\nThird, the Tolling Fees do not compensate for actual loss because they are speculative. The PPA calls for further upgrades and investments over the 20-year period of the PPA, as well as resets in the Tolling Fee to be negotiated between Balkan and the Government. *(See e.g.* PPA Clauses 2; 8; 11.1 and First Schedule,) A 20-year award for Tolling Fees would clearly be a penalty because it would not be conditioned upon (a) Balkan making the investments to perform those upgrades; (b) Balkan\u2019s actual performance in achieving these upgrades; (c) renegotiating rates; or (d) any other requirement of performance or expense by Balkan under the PPA.834\n\nRejoinder, paras, 130.1-130.3.\n\n590.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent argues that even if the PPA were enforceable, and even if the Claimant could demonstrate entitlement to Tolling Fees under Clause 13.9, \"the Tribunal would still be required to reject Balkan\u2019s claim for Tolling Fees for the next 20 years under Clause 11,9 as an unenforceable penalty under Ghanaian law\".835\n\nRejoinder, para. 131.\n\n591.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondent elaborates further on the third reason why it believes that Claimant\u2019s claim for Tolling Fees fails. According to the Respondent, the Claimant \"is not entitled to Tolling Fees after April 2009... [as the Claimant\u2019s] failure to install the RTU and connect to the Grid after receiving ABB\u2019s RTU proposal in April 2009 precludes its claim for Tolling Fees under Clause 11.9 of the PPA from and after that date,\"836\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 168.\n\n**3. The. Tribunal\u2019s Findings Concerning Damages for Non-payment of Tolling Fees**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n592.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that because no power was ever produced by the Power Station, irrespectively of the questions concerning site electricity and grid connectivity, no Tolling Fees are owed by the Respondent on this count. Payment would only be due under the PPA if power were actually supplied or the Power Station was ready to supply it but could not do so for failure of grid connectivity attributable to the Respondent, None of the requirements were met as the Power Station was never finally tested and commissioned because of the reasons that have been examined, which are independent of the failures of the Respondent in respect of the compliance of its own obligations under the PPA.\n\n593.\n\nIt follows that for the Tribunal to award damages to the Claimant in respect of Tolling Fees it would need to hold that the Power Station was ready for delivering power. The evidence, however, does not prove that such was the case. On the contrary, Claimant\u2019s submission that Tolling Fees were due at the very least from 9 July 2009, the date Ansaldo certified the Power Station running at Full Speed No Load, fails because the Tribunal has not found this certification to be credible or even properly done. Grid connectivity, while indispensable at the end of the commissioning process, was not shown to have been the main reason for such failure although as also found it would have been preferable and helpful to that end. Even if all such Respondent\u2019s obligations had been fully complied with, the Power Station would still not have been able to deliver power.\n\n594.\n\nThe Claimant also demands damages on account of a return on investment of at least 15% per year as from 1 January 2014, the estimated date of this Award, and until the end date of the PPA on 31 October 2027, as provided for under the PPA Clause 11.l(ii). Such minimum return assumes, however, that the Power Station will be in full operation during that considerable period of years, as otherwise there would be an unproductive investment which could hardly justify that return.\n\n595.\n\nWhile the Respondent\u2019s argument that no Tolling Fees are owed as a consequence of the PPA being void *ab initio* is unsustainable in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s findings, there is some merit in the Respondent\u2019s view that Tolling Fees are not in any way Lied to Balkan\u2019s actual loss in the event of a breach by the Respondent, and would thus amount to an unenforceable penalty under Ghanaian law. In fact, the Tribunal will find below that the Claimant is entitled to compensation because of Respondent\u2019s breach of obligations under the PPA, but that finding is independent of the claim for Tolling Fees.\n\n**B. Repudiation Damages**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n596.\n\nIn addition, in the alternative to Tolling Fees, and/or to the extent it is determined that the Respondent has abandoned or wrongly terminated the PPA, the Claimant seeks repudiation damages, which it submits are \"the discounted value of the total Tolling Fees that would otherwise be due under... [Clause] 11,9\" as is calculated in the \"Contract Revenue calculation\" provided at Attachment 234 to Exhibit C-38,837 The Claimant makes no express reference to any claim for repudiation damages in its Post-Hearing Submission.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 339.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s claim for Toiling Fees on the basis of repudiation also fails.838 First, the Respondent argues that because the PPA is void *ab initio,* there can be no claim for repudiation as a matter of law.839\n\nRejoinder, para. 132.\n\nRejoinder, para. 133; *Attorney General* v. *Faroe* (full citation not provided).\n\n598.\n\nSecond, and in the alternative, the Respondent contends that even if the PPA were valid, a claim of repudiation does not exist given the Claimant\u2019s alleged failure to perform under the PPA.840 According to the Respondent, if anyone has repudiated the PPA, it is the Claimant.841\n\nRejoinder, para. 133.\n\nRejoinder, para. 139.\n\n599.\n\nThird, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant \"cannot and does not show \u2018an absolute refusal [by the Government] to perform [its] side of the contract prior to the commencement of this Arbitration\u2019\"; a necessary element to a successful repudiation claim cited by leading contract law authorities.842 The Respondent argues that \"[t]o the contrary, the evidence shows that on August 8, 2008, the Government provided a Transmission Line to the Project Site expressly so that Balkan could complete the commissioning of the Power station and conduct Final Performance Testing.\"843\n\nRejoinder, para. 1.34, fn. 46: *Freelh* v. *Burr* (1878) LR 9 CP 209, at 123, as cited in Chitty on Contracts, 30th ed., at 24-018.\n\nRejoinder, para. 135.\n\n600.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that it was only after the Claimant commenced this arbitration that the Respondent sought, and obtained, the Supreme Court Judgment declaring the PPA unconstitutional and void *ab initio.*844 In this regard, the Respondent submits that \"an application to the court to determine the validity of a contract or the obligation of the parties does not constitute repudiation.\"845 The Respondent emphasizes that even after obtaining the Supreme Court Judgment, it took no steps to enforce the Judgment pending the outcome of this arbitration.846\n\nRejoinder, para. 136; Witness Statement of Vivienne Gadzekpo, para. 4.\n\nRejoinder, para. 137; Chitty on Contracts, 30 ed., at 24-019, citing *Spettabile Consortia Veneziano di Armamento di Navigazione* v. *Northumberland Shipbuilding Co. Ltd.* (1919) 121 LT 628 and *Woodar Investment Development Ltd.* v. *Wimpey Construction U.K. Ltd.* [1980] 1 WLR 277.\n\nRejoinder, para, 138.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings Concerning Repudiation Damages**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n601.\n\nThe Tribunal is not of the view that repudiation damages are warranted as an alternative to Tolling Fees or because the Respondent abandoned or wrongly terminated the PPA. Nor is there room for Respondent's argument that the PPA is void *ab initio* and thus there could be no repudiation damages as a matter of law.\n\n602.\n\nThe situation is altogether different as explained above. Roth Parties have requested the Tribunal to declare the PPA terminated in the light of the breach of the other Party\u2019s obligations. Termination is therefore not the result of either Party having wrongfully terminated the PPA but rather the result of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion to bring an end to the dispute, on the basis of the Parties\u2019 respective requests, and the recognition by the Tribunal that performance under the contract would serve no purpose at this stage. In the view of the Tribunal, neither Party has fully complied with its obligations under the PPA.\n\n603.\n\nThe nature of this state of non-performance is different for each Party. While the Claimant has not finally tested and commissioned the Power Station for reasons not attributable to the Respondent and is thus not in the position to generate and deliver power, the Respondent\u2019s performance failures emerge from the issues concerning site electricity and grid connectivity, among other that have been discussed. The Tribunal is convinced that neither of the Parties has refused to perform its obligations, which would be a key factor in establishing repudiation. The Tribunal has rather found that performance has been materially unattainable in the Claimant\u2019s case and that the Respondent has only partly discharged its own obligations, in an untimely manner and in the face of technical difficulties that do always not appear to have been satisfactorily corrected.\n\n604.\n\nThe Tribunal is also of the view, as argued by the Respondent, that applying to the courts in respect of the validity of the PPA does not amount to repudiation. The Tribunal must also note the Respondent\u2019s assertion that even after obtaining the Supreme Court Judgment it took no steps to enforce the Judgment pending the outcome of this arbitration. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is room for a determination by the Ghanaian judiciary that is consistent with the conclusions of this Award.\n\n605.\n\nRepudiation damages are accordingly denied.\n\n**C. Restitution Damages**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n606.\n\nIn the alternative to Tolling Fees and/or repudiation damages, and/or to the extent the Tribunal determines that the PPA is unenforceable, the Claimant seeks restitution damages.847 It claims that its restitution damages exceed USD 40 million, comprising the total amount it claims to have spend through Zenith Bank, together with monies allegedly spend or incurred by Balkan US.848\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 340.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 340; Exhibit C-37: Witness Statement of Neil Crouch; Exhibit C-37, Attachment 18: \"US Expenses\", Attachment 56: \"Unpaid or Disputed Payables\", Attachment 57: \"Cumulative Detailed Zenith Bank Statements\".\n\n607.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submission, the Claimant sets out three elements that must be fulfilled in a claim for unjust enrichment and elaborates on why each of them is satisfied in the present case:849\n\na) The Respondent has been enriched or received a benefit: the Claimant contends that this element is fulfilled insofar as the Barge has been enhanced by BEL and its value has increased.850\n\nb) The enrichment is at the expense of the claimant: according to the Claimant, the said enhancement and benefit has been at the Claimant\u2019s expense.851\n\nc) The enrichment is unjustified: the Claimant submits that this element has been satisfied because the Claimant relied on the Respondent\u2019s opinion that parliamentary approval was not required and invested in the Barge.852\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 148.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 150.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 150.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 149.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence of the expenses it purports to have incurred for work it completed; a mere spreadsheet listing its purported expenses and wire transfer payments was attached to its Statement of Claim and only three months of invoices (October 2008 to January 2009) were provided with its Reply.853 The Respondent further argues that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate how the alleged expenses it incurred enriched the Respondent.854\n\nRejoinder, para, 141; Exhibit C-57, Attachments 61, 62, 63.\n\nRejoinder, para. 143.\n\n609.\n\nThe Respondent states that the principle of unjust enrichment requires that;\n\n\u25a0 the Respondent has been enriched by the receipt of a benefit;\n\n\u25a0 this enrichment is at the expense of the Claimant;\n\n\u25a0 the retention of the enrichment is unfair; and\n\n\u25a0 there is no Defense or bar to the claim.855\n\nRejoinder, para, 141.\n\n610.\n\nThe Respondent goes on to assert three reasons why the Respondent has failed to prove its unjust enrichment claim.856 First, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not demonstrated \"that its alleged expenses resulted in *any* value to the Government, the fundamental element of an unjust enrichment claim.\"857 In support, the Respondent reiterates its assertions that the Power Station remains incapable of generating any power and that the Claimant has not furnished any evidence of successful commissioning and testing of any of the critical systems on the Barge (the turbines, generator, DCS, fuel tanks, 161 kV GTS switchgear, transformer, relay protection devices).858\n\nRejoinder, paras. 148-151.\n\nRejoinder, para. 148.\n\nRejoinder, para. 148.\n\n611.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that, the Claimant \"cannot ignore its own admission that ProEnergy overbilled for the work it did, and that much of the ProEnergy\u2019s work had to be redone,\"859 In the absence of any evidence presented by the Claimant that systems on the Barge have been successfully tested, the Respondent similarly questions the Claimant\u2019s invoices for work done after ProEnergy left the Project Site.860\n\nRejoinder, para. 149; Exhibit R-7: \"Deposition of Phillip David Elders, *ProEnergy Services, LLC* v. *Balkan Energy Co.,* No, 09-4026\", at 184:8-14.\n\nRejoinder, para. 149.\n\n612.\n\nThird, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that many of the expenses for which it seems reimbursement are linked to the Barge, ft insists that \"[w]ithout appropriate backup documentation, neither the Tribunal nor anyone else could reach a reliable conclusion regarding the validity of the expense occurred.\"861\n\nRejoinder, para. 150.\n\n613.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s 7 June Letter, the Respondent denies that any interest expenses or general PPA-related expenses can be recovered as restitutionary damages because they are loss-based.862 As regards commissioning expenses, the Respondent argues that these are loss-related expenses and that, since none of the systems of the Barge is actually operable, no benefit has been conferred to the Respondent.863 The Respondent also alleges several errors in the Claimant\u2019s damages calculations.864 Finally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant is not entitled to any restitutionary damages for expenses incurred after July 2009, as the Claimant performed no further commissioning work on the Barge after that date.865\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 189, 190.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 191.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para. 192.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, para, 193.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings Concerning Restitution Damage** s\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that the PPA cannot be enforced in the present circumstances and thus there is a legal basis to examine the claim for restitution damages. It is a fact that the Claimant has spent a significant amount of money in its efforts to get the Power Station to an operational state. Although the Claimant invokes unjust enrichment to justify its claim under this heading, the Tribunal does not consider this to be the appropriate legal basis as it has been concluded above that the requirements for unjust enrichment are not met in this case. In fact as long as there is no power generation and delivery, the essential purpose and objective of the PPA, the Respondent cannot be considered to have unjustly enriched itself at the expense of the Claimant in an unjustified manner.\n\n615.\n\nIt is true that in principle, as the Claimant asserts, the value of the Barge has to an undetermined extent increased in view of the work done and the equipment introduced and this would be at the disposal of the Respondent for any future project related thereto. This is, however, marginal to the value of the project as a whole and thus could not justify damages on the basis of unjust enrichment. The Tribunal is mindful, however, that the Respondent bears some degree of responsibility for the failure of the Project, not decisive as the Claimant argues but sufficient for the Tribunal to take it into account in assessing damages.\n\n616.\n\nHaving considered the Respondent\u2019s non-performance of its obligations in a fully satisfactory manner, the incidence this has had in not facilitating the final testing and commissioning of the Power Station that would have been desirable and the eventual increase in costs this situation has created, the Tribunal will grant to the Claimant a measure of restitution damages on the basis of the Respondent\u2019s liability.\n\n617.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the Claimant in respect of the amount of such damages is difficult to assess. The Respondent has rightly commented that spreadsheets and wire transfers are not in themselves evidence of the damages sought, that not all expenses listed can be attached to the work on the Barge and that even Claimant argued that ProEnergy had overtoiled for the work purportedly done. It is also to be noted that general PPA expenses should not be considered as a part of restitution damages. In addition, the Respondent notes that to the extent that work at the Barge stopped in mid-2009 there could be no justifiable expenses after this date.\n\n618.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the revised information submitted by the Claimant on this count of damages\u2014in particular, the documentation submitted as Exhibit C-59, Attachment 66, and the lists of alleged expenditures submitted on 1 July 2013 as Attachments III, 1(a), 111.2(a) and 111.5(a)\u2014and the comments thereon in the Respondent\u2019s 10 July Letter with a view to determining which amounts can be linked to actual work on the Barge or reasonably related thereto, and which should be excluded as a result of being general expenses that could have at best a remote connection to the work on the Barge. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimant must be compensated for expenditures that are directly linked to the existence of the PPA; that have plausibly contributed to the advancement of the commissioning of the Barge; and that are sufficiently justified by evidence.\n\n619.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed records of payment falling within the following broad categories: Purchase of materials or other items to be incorporated into the Barge; payments to contractors other than Pro-Energy; payments to Pro-Energy; payroll of BEL\u2019s workers directly engaged in the commissioning of the Barge; payments for fuel, fuel tanks, site electricity and site internet; generator rental; maintenance; costs of BEL\u2019s facilities at Effasu; accommodation and food; inspections of the Barge, the surrounding facilities and transmission lines by BEL; shipping costs, freights, and customs charges of goods delivered to Effasu; flights to and from Ghana; helicopter charter; permit fees; project insurance; other insurance covering professional risks relating to the project operation; payroll administration for BEL\u2019s administrative personnel at the Accra Office; Accra office expenses; Accra office furniture, laptop computers, etc; Accra office lease and other office-operating expenses (electricity, telephone, cleaning materials, printing cartridges, office supplies); other Accra office expenses (security fence, business cards); consultancy fees; public relations expenditures; taxes; other expenditures.\n\n620.\n\nIt is evident that not ail of these categories of expenditures meet the test established above. Some expenditures are not even directly linked to the existence of the PPA but appear to have been made in furtherance of the Claimant\u2019s other business activities. Many expenditures cannot plausibly be said to have contributed to the advancement of the commissioning of the Barge. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, only the following categories of expenditures can qualify in principle for restitution;\n\n\u2022 Purchase of materials or other items to be incorporated into the Barge;\n\n\u2022 Payments to contractors other than Pro-Energy;\n\n\u2022 Payroll of BEL\u2019s workers directly engaged in the commissioning of the Barge;\n\n\u2022 Payments for fuel, fuel tanks, site electricity and site internet;\n\n\u2022 Generator rental;\n\n\u2022 Maintenance; costs of BEL\u2019s facilities at Effasu;\n\n\u2022 Reasonable expenses for accommodation and food;\n\n\u2022 Inspections of the Barge, the surrounding facilities and transmission lines by BEL;\n\n\u2022 Shipping costs, freights, and customs charges of goods delivered to Effasu;\n\n\u2022 Permit fees; and\n\n\u2022 Project insurance,\n\n621.\n\nWithin each of these categories, the Tribunal had to satisfy itself that the Claimant has met its onus to prove that such expenses were actually incurred, and payments made, in the amounts alleged by the Claimant. The documentation submitted by the Claimant in this regard was often inadequate. It suffices to describe some of the difficulties encountered by the Tribunal here: Many payments were not supported by copies of invoices; instead payment slips from banks (typically Zenith Bank) were provided. In spite of these evidentiary shortcomings the Tribunal has accepted such evidence to the extent that it was persuaded that a payment was in fact made, the addressee of the payment was discernible, and the purpose of the payment was apparent.\n\n622.\n\nIn respect of other, sometimes very substantial payments, the only evidence submitted was a bank ledger that did not allow the Tribunal to trace the addressee of the payment or appreciate the goods or services that were provided in exchange for it. In such cases, the Tribunal could not be certain that the payment was in fact made to the company, and/or for the purposes, contended by the Claimant. Moreover, in reviewing the bank ledger submitted as Exhibit C-59, Attachment 70, the Tribunal found that a number of the Claimant\u2019s allegations of expenditures supported by this document were questionable because of the identification of duplicate claims\u2014several alleged payments in the same amount., made to different entities, appear to have been justified by reference to the same entry of that bank ledger,\n\n623.\n\nOther evidence that the Tribunal did not find satisfactory included hand-written notes by an unidentified person or entity confirming payment, in lieu of an actual invoice or bank statement.\n\n624.\n\nConsistently with its findings above, that the present dispute crystallized in mid-2009 and no significant commissioning activities took place as of that date, the Tribunal has excluded from the scope of recoverable restitution damages any expenditures that were incurred as of mid-2009. The Tribunal is convinced that, as of that time, BEL\u2019s personnel was primarily concerned with preparing legal action against Ghana and its technical work concentrated on preservation rather than improvement of the Barge.\n\n625.\n\nOn the basis of its review of the evidence, the Tribunal concludes and decides that the amounts owed by the Respondent to the Claimant as restitution damages are USD 7 million and CEDI 7.5 million, the latter being roughly equivalent to USD 5 million, totaling USD 12 million.866\n\nIn converting the CEDI amount to USD, the Tribunal has had regard to the historical interbank foreign exchange rate for USD purchases on 1 July 2009.\n\n626.\n\nThe Tribunal must note, finally, that the Claimant\u2019s claim for damages was, as indicated, much higher than that awarded by the Tribunal, in significant part due to the fact that the damages claimed included BEL\u2019s payment of interest for loans in US$ and CEDI to Zenith Bank. It is not unusual that an investment will be financed by means of loaned funds on which interest will be due\u2014a situation that indeed occurred in this case, as explained by Mr. Crouch\u2019s witness statement.867 While under principles of common law it is possible for a tribunal to allow interest as a head of damage when damages are awarded for breach of contract, a claimant must not be at fault insofar the breach of contract is concerned. In this case the Claimant has been found to have a degree of responsibility in the breach of the PPA, just as the Respondent has. It follows that it is not justified for the Tribunal to award damages for financial costs as might be the case if the breach of contract is wholly the result of the default of the respondent. In addition, it is quite impossible to determine which part of those financial costs relate to expenditures for commissioning pursuant to the PPA and which relate to expenditures for which the Tribunal has decided not to award damages. This claim for financial costs cannot be considered by the Tribunal in the circumstances of the case.\n\nTranscript, Day 7 (Hearing on the Merits), 81: 18-81:25.\n\n**D. Incidental Damages**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n627.\n\nIn support of its claim for incidental damages, the Claimant submits a letter written by Mr. Elders to the Ministry of Energy on 21 July 2008. In that letter, Mr. Elders summarized the expenses BEL allegedly incurred as a result of the alleged unavailability of site electricity, totaling USD 2,482,000.868\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 341; Exhibit C-38. Attachment 109: \"BE[L] letter re; Barge (First Fire)\"; Exhibit C-40: Witness Statement of Lonnie Peters, paras. 15-16.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant\u2019s claim for incidental damages fails because it is unsubstantiated.869 In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Claimant \"fails to submit any invoices which would permit the Tribunal to verify that the expenses were indeed incurred or that the ProEnergy reports are reliable in light of Balkan\u2019s prior admissions that ProEnergy engaged in improper invoicing, double billing and corrective work\".870\n\nRejoinder, para. 153.\n\nRejoinder, para. 153.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings in Respect of Incidental Damages**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n629.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded on the facts of the claim that site electricity was faulty, experiencing frequent interruptions or unavailability for hours and even days. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s position that it was indispensable in these circumstances to have additional generation capacity available on site to support its commissioning and testing efforts, including the running of the RTU system (in fact, it bears recalling that ProEnergy had even requested the purchase of a second generator to this end). The Tribunal would also note that there is no dispute between the Parties that some expense was indeed incurred by BEL for purchasing and renting generators to improve site electricity. Given the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion above, that the Respondent bears responsibility for the failure to make adequate site electricity available, the Tribunal is in principie minded to grant the Claimant\u2019s claim for incidental damages.\n\n630.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the amount of USD 2,482,000 claimed as incidental damages is constituted by expenditures for power generation equipment purchase and rental, fuel, maintenance and repair of equipment and the labour cost that BEL expended during periods in which it could not be productive due to power outages.871 In its review of the voluminous documentation provided by the Claimant in support of its restitution claim, the Tribunal encountered several cost items, and accompanying evidence of payments, relating to each of these categories\u2014equipment purchase and rental (including generators), jet fuel, repair and maintenance works and payroll expenditures. To the extent that such payments were sufficiently supported by evidence, the Tribunal has taken these expenditures into consideration as commissioning expenditures. The Claimant will therefore be compensated for such expenditures under the heading of \"restitution damages\".\n\nExhibit C-38, Attachment 109.\n\n631.\n\nIt is evident that the Claimant cannot doubly recover its expenditures resulting from power shortfall *both* as restitution damages *and* incidental damages. Any amounts restituted to the Claimant as commissioning expenditures would need to be deducted from the amount of incidental damages to be awarded. However, the evidence submitted in these proceedings does not permit the Tribunal to determine whether there are any expenditures resulting from power shortfall that do not at the same time constitute commissioning expenditures (and may thus entitle the Claimant to restitution damages). Generally, it seems to the Tribunal that BEL\u2019s commissioning expenditures also include such additional costs as it incurred as a result of the power conditions on site.\n\n632.\n\nIn the absence of any more specific evidence from the Claimant to the contrary, the Tribunal therefore concludes that any incidental damages that the Claimant may be entitled to as a result of power shortfall on site are adequately compensated by the award of restitution damages pursuant to Paragraph 625.\n\n**E. Other Damages**\n--------------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Claimant has also submitted a claim in the amount of US$ 2,586,000 as the cost of replacement of the DCS in the context of its claim for conversion and trespass. While the Tribunal would normally regard compensation for the disruption of the ordinary course of business as justified, in finds that this claim has not been supported by adequate evidence about the damage allegedly caused. There is no documentation in the record as to whether a new DCS had in fact been purchased as a consequence of the alleged damage to the equipment on site and there is thus no evidence supporting a conclusion to grant compensation for a replacement value.\n\n634.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that in any event any expenditure relating to this claim would have been made later than mid-2009, the cut-off period after which the Tribunal has concluded that no significant commissioning work was undertaken. A new DCS would accordingly not be necessary if commissioning had in fact entirely stopped and its purchase would thus find no justification in the light of the Claimant\u2019s general duty to minimize damages.\n\n635.\n\nThe issue concerning the arrest of Mr. Everhart is one that, aside any personal claims by the affected person, results in interference with the ordinary course of business. The Claimant leaves the determination of the damage owed to the discretion of the Tribunal. The Tribunal decides that the amount of USD 50,000 is appropriate in the context of this interference with BEL\u2019s conduct of business. The Tribunal in any event expects that Ghana will put an end to any claims pursued against the Claimant\u2019s officers.\n\n**F. The Counterclaim for Damages**\n-----------------------------------\n\n636.\n\nThe Respondent has also requested in its Counterclaim that the Tribunal orders Claimant to pay USD 300,000 for its liability in terms of breach of contract. The Tribunal accepts this counterclaim in the light of Clause 14.2 of the PPA, Such amount shall be deducted from the damages owed by the Respondent to the Claimant.\n\n**G. Interest**\n---------------\n\n637.\n\nThe Tribunal has established that the Claimant is entitled to restitution damages under this Award in respect of selected expenditures up to mid-2009. Accordingly, interest shall accrue on the amount owed to the Claimant as restitution damages as of 1 July 2009, until the date of full payment.\n\n638.\n\nIn view that the compensation awarded as a result of the arrest of the Claimant\u2019s officer Mr. Everhart attends in essence to his personal inconvenience and corporate interference and not to pecuniary damages, the Tribunal shall not award interest for the payment owed.\n\n639.\n\nIn determining the appropriate interest rate, the Tribunal has had regard to the Parties\u2019 views, expressed in the PPA, in respect of the interest rate that is to apply in case o\u00ed' a default of payment by either Party, According to Clause 11.6 of the PPA, interest is set at a rate corresponding to the Six-Month LIBOR plus one percent (1%) per annum in case of a failure by the Respondent to make payment \"in respect of fees or otherwise\", whereas Clause 12.3 of the PPA fixes the same rate \"if any amount payable by (the Claimant] is not paid on or before the due date\". The Tribunal considers that this rate reflects the expectations of both Parties at the time of the conclusion of the PPA in the event of any delayed payment, and the Tribunal sees no reason to deviate from this interest rate set by the Parties in the context of the present Award. Interest shall be compounded annually.\n\n**H. Costs of Arbitration**\n---------------------------\n\n640.\n\nIn accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the costs of the arbitration are fixed as follows:\n\n*Arbitrator Fees and Expenses*\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a: **USD 352,271.35**\n\n*Fees:* USD 326,700.00  \n*Expenses:* USD 25,571.35\n\nJudge Stephen M. Schwebel: **USD 254,799.72**\n\nFees: USD 234,920.00  \n*Expenses:* USD 19,879.73\n\nJudge Thomas A. Mensah: **USD 193,900 00**\n\nFees: USD 193,900.00  \n*Expenses:* USD 0\n\n*Registry Fees of the PCA:***USD 114,168.05**\n\n*Expenses (including for travel, accommodation,* *court reporting, room hire, express courier, bank charges and telephone conferences):* **USD 87,550.17**\n\nTOTAL COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION **USD 1,002,689.29**\n\n641.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that under Clause 22.2 of the PPA each Party is to bear its own costs of legal representation, and both Parties shall share the costs\u2019 of the arbitration equally. Given that the Parties reached an agreement on costs that pre-dates this arbitration, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to make an order in this regard. The Tribunal accordingly shall follow the agreement reached by the Parties on costs. The costs of the arbitration are thus to be shared equally by the Parlies. Given that the Claimant has paid USD 30,000 more than the Respondent the Tribunal shall order that such amount be reimbursed by the Respondent to the Claimant.\n\n**VII. DISPOSITIF**\n-------------------\n\n642.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides and orders as follows:\n\n**1.****The PPA shall be terminated as at the date of this Award.**\n\n**2. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant the amount of USD 12 million, in consideration of the Claimant\u2019s commissioning works at the Power Station.**\n\n**3. The Claimant shall pay the Respondent the amount of USD 300,000 for its own breach of contract as per the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim.**\n\n**4. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant an additional amount of USD 50,000 in respect of the arrest of one of the Claimant\u2019s officers.**\n\n**5. The Respondent shall pay the Claimant interest on the amounts awarded in subparagraph 2 at a rate corresponding to the Six-Month LIBOR plus one percent (1%) per annum. The Claimant shall also pay the Respondent interest at the same rate on the amount awarded to the latter in subparagraph 3. Interest shall start to accrue on I July 2009. Interest shall be compounded annually.**\n\n**6. All other claims by the Claimant are dismissed.**\n\n**7. Each Party shall pay half of the costs of this arbitration, which total USD 1,002,689.29. The Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant the amount paid by the latter in excess in the amount of USD 30,000.**"}]}
